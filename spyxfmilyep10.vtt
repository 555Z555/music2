00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.820
Good morning, Mr. Henderson.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.070
A very pleasant
morning to you too.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.780
Would you like a cup of
tea for the morning?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.830
Oh, yes, please.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.210
It's been some time since you last
handled elementary students, right?

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.380
What do you think
of this year's students?

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.840
They seem to be worth disciplining.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.510
After all, you already gave a
Tonitrus Bolt on the first day...

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.390
Well, that was a rare occurrence
in our prestigious Eden, I must say.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.820
As far as I know, it was the
first time in our history.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.780
I only meant to give a fair
ruling to every student.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.610
Good behaviors must be honored,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.990
and misbehavior punished accordingly.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.910
That is the essence of education.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.790
Excuse me for missing that.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.210
The elementary students who have
passed through the gates of Eden...

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.670
...will learn to preserve
traditions passed on to them...

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.880
...as they try to become more
and more elegant each day.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.010
Our school stands for making
the future of this country elegant.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.990
Master Damian!

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.210
Isn't this your brother in the picture?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.790
Yeah...

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.880
This was from his
entrance ceremony, right?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.500
Are there any more pictures of him?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.590
Oh, there he is!

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.630
Wow!

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.890
This one too!

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.390
And this one too!

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.470
He was really an MVP in this picture!

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.600
Your brother got a lot of
Stella Stars so quickly, right!

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.140
He's really amazing!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.900
But I'm sure you'll become an
Imperial Scholar faster than him!

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.070
The first one to receive
a Stella from our year...

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.240
...will obviously be you, Master Damian!

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.860
Y-Yeah...

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.700
But we're still a long way
from the exams...

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.950
Our first shot will be...

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.330
Oh, right!

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.170
We have a dodgeball
competition for next week's PE!

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.210
Oh!

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.590
My friend heard this
from his friend in Class 7...

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.090
But apparently,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.260
if you become the MVP there,
you'll get a Stella!

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.300
Really?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.680
This is it, Master Damian!

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.810
MVP, huh...

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.710
The weather is clear today.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.500
My youths...

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.300
Today, you are weaving a
new page in the history of Eden.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.680
Elegantly.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.050
And also brilliantly.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.680
Beat it!

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.220
You're the one
starting the fight, damn it!

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.600
I'm not at fault.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.100
She's right! You guys star...

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.440
Oh, you shut up!

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.190
Huh?!

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.980
Jerk.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.690
Who're you calling a jerk,
you short legs?!

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.780
You can't say
something like that to a girl!

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.950
Elegant...

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.970
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.850
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.980
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.650
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.570
On the template of happiness,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.120
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.330
We can't be as we are,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.670
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.760
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.800
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.970
they still don't disappear

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.560
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.560
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.770
And I know

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.190
Every day is so mediocre,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.990
but I'm here and so are you

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.370
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.460
Anya's back!

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.510
Welcome back, Anya.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.130
Anya's got good news, Father!

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.390
What?!

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.720
A Stella will be rewarded
for the next PE lesson?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.010
Becky said that.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.310
My friend heard this
from her friend in Class 7...

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.810
But apparently,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.110
the MVP of the winning class...

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.560
...will get a Stella Star!

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.530
Apparently, huh...

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.700
Hmm... Kind of suspicious to me.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.410
This calls for another training, Anya!

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.330
Training!

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.410
So what's the sport?

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.570
Dodgeball.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.000
Dodgeball...?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.840
Is that a sport where you hit and
bury your opponent with a ball?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.210
Bury...?

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.470
Teach Anya a finisher move, Mother!

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.010
All right!

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.140
I'll teach you the finisher ball strike!

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.810
So you're good at sports, Yor?

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.100
Ah, no...

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.270
All I ever did was play catch
with my brother in the past...

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.570
I can't tell them I tear people up
and throw them around on a regular basis!

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.110
Leave it to me, Anya!

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.820
Let's catch a star
with the finisher strike!

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.030
Anya will catch a star
in the dodgeball game!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.370
Star Catch Anya will work hard!

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.620
- That's the spirit!
- I'm glad she's into it, but...

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.620
- Star Catch Super Anya!
- I'm glad she's into it, but...

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:09.750
That's right!

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.420
Let's start with muscle training.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.380
One.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.720
Two.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.100
Three.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.520
Four.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:32.535
(Deadly Sit-Ups)

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.610
Five.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.400
Six.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.040
It's important to build up your stamina.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.920
Anya!

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.420
Listen carefully now.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.670
You don't throw your ball
with only your arm's strength.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.510
Firmly take a step forward...

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.800
...and twist your waist
while shifting your weight...

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.720
...to transfer the force
toward your shoulder...

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.810
And there!

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.440
All right! Let's see how you try!

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.400
Loid.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.530
Ah...

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.620
(Image Training)

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.490
Is this part of the training?
(Image Training)

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.910
I don't really get it,
(Image Training)

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.210
but I'll just leave it to her.
(Image Training)

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.990
(Image Training)

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.000
Wake up, Anya.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.630
Huh?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.010
Hyeah!

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.010
Hyeah!

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.880
Hah!

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.010
Hah!

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.720
Hyah!

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.800
Hyah!

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.720
Fwoosh!

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.600
Fwoosh!

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.470
Fwish!

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.350
Fwish!

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.520
Wham!

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.020
Wham!

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.330
Anya will catch the star tomorrow!

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.840
I've done my best.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840
I've also endured
Mother's ruthless training.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.220
Finally, I've also thought of the
name for the finisher strike.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.220
I'll catch the stars!

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.520
I'll catch a lot of stars...

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.530
...and help out with Father's mission!

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.860
The only thing big about
you is your words, huh!

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.530
Just don't drag Master
Damian down, you short legs!

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:50.620
The second son!

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.580
...And his servants.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.870
Why do we have to team
up with the boys too?

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.710
I can't stand being in the
same team with this guy.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.160
Huh?!

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.590
He's Father's target's second son...

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.460
It'll make his mission
easier if I befriend him...

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.010
W-What are you looking at?

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.550
But he'll bully me, so I hate him.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.890
I don't have time for
a little prick like you either!

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.060
Prick...?!

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.020
I'll become the MVP of this
match and get a Stella!

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.490
I must become an Imperial Scholar
as my brother...

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.610
If I fail...

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.030
My father won't even
spare a glance at me.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.410
W-Wait up, Master Damian!

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.210
Assemble!

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.000
Due to Mr. Bobby
taking a sick leave today,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.010
I will be taking over today's lesson.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.510
Let us play a fair and elegant game...

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.600
...in the spirit of the nobles.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.170
Yes, Sir!

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.220
Without further ado,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.800
we will begin the class competition of

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.980
dodgeball between Class 3,
Cecile Hall, and Class 4, Wald Hall!

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.730
Match start!

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:09.980
(Mission: 10 - The Great Dodgeball Plan)

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.990
Let's go for the win, Master Damian!

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.080
You can do it, Damian!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.000
Master Damian!

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.880
We've gathered some info on Class 4!

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.090
All right.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.130
Huh!

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.590
There's no other way than
to become the MVP for a Stella.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.760
And my rival...

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.470
...will be him!

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.810
In order to win this
match against Class 4...

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.150
...I need to take him out first!

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.190
Son of the National Army's major...

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.570
(Bill Watkins (6))
Bill Watkins!

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.490
Nice catch, Bill!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.200
What's with that monster?!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.500
He can't be the
same age as us, can he?!

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.500
It's him...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.000
Bazooka Bill!

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.880
With his excellent
physique and intelligence,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.380
he's a monster has won numerous ball game
competitions since his kindergarten days!

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.760
There can't be that many
competitions in kindergarten, right?!

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.270
It's dangerous to
wear glasses here, old man.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.270
Thank you for your concern,
Damian, the Chairman's son.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.480
But it won't hit me in
the face, so fear not.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.270
Besides...

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.280
A hit above the
shoulders doesn't count.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.990
Confirming enemy position.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.530
Adjusting airflow
and humidity... all good.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.000
Uegh!

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.410
Oof!

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.750
Oww!

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.580
Kyaah!

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.330
Four hits.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.340
What?!

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.590
- That's Bill for you!
- How did he...?!

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.380
Don't panic!

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.920
It's obviously just a fluke!

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.260
It's no fluke at all.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.930
Every single of my throw...

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.140
...has been perfectly calculated.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.480
And not just in simulation.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.270
I've also trained myself physically.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.250
Daddy!

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.380
Bill, my son.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.380
Yes, Daddy.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.180
You are the man who shall become
Eden's, and eventually, the Army's hero.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.690
Grasp a Stella with your hands!

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.770
For the future of Ostania!

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.610
Sir, yes, Sir!

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.980
That's right.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.190
My victory is certain.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.320
Hey!
I'll die if I get hit by one of those!

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.870
Fear not.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.700
I'll hold back against girls.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.500
That also kind of pisses me off!

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.160
Ouch!

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.540
Hit.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.170
You talk big for your size, huh.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.920
Do you really think
we'll fight without a plan, you giant?

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.800
A dodgeball...

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.060
...is not a solo game!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.280
Oww!

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.370
Go for MVP!

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.010
I'll get the MVP title!

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.100
Let's go, guys! Formation G!

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.180
Right!

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.780
Four hits.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.200
I'm not done yet!

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.210
Shadow... Clone...

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.290
Attack!

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.630
Clone, huh...

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.390
A shadow clone attack...

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.010
...should look like this!

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.480
Master Damian...

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.110
Being able to stand by your side...

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.730
...was a lot of fun.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.730
Emile!

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.990
I know a lot of your
good sides, Master Damian!

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.070
I just can't think of any now,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.240
but I'm sure you have some.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.750
Please win this for us, Master Damian!

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.000
You'll always be the one and only...

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.630
...MVP for all of us!

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.680
The forbidden face block...

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.520
Emile!

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.980
Emile! Wake up!

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.690
Yuwen...

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.190
Idiot...

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.650
Don't cry, will you?

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.990
I'm not!

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.780
Promise me...

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.200
...not to lose hope...

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.540
...till the end...

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.160
Yeah... I know...

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.420
It'll all be over for us if we gi...

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.460
Damn it!

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.920
We'll lose at this rate!

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.920
I need to somehow
catch him off guard...

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.180
I don't care how many
of us he's taken down.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.180
I need to win this and stand out alone!

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.020
He's a jerk.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.390
Now...

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.890
That small girl's my next target.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.020
I'll aim for her feet!

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.400
Oh, he missed his shot! Lucky!

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.530
I'll pass the ball now, come on!

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.740
Did she just jump...

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.910
...before I threw the ball?!

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.410
Take this!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.040
Then I'll just go for her right arm next!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.420
Left arm!

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.800
I'll just use my trump card, then...!

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.090
This ball will change
its trajectory in a flash...

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.010
...to chase and hit
those trying to dodge it!

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.680
Take this!

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.810
Homing Slider Shoot!

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.640
You call that holding back against girls?!

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.890
Ouch!

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.020
Ouch!

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.980
Hit.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:10.690
No way!

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.780
I can't believe it...

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.990
She's totally reading my pitch!

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.910
Just whoever is she?!

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.870
You're pretty good, huh?

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.410
Heh.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.410
The etymology of dodgeball, "dodge"...

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.580
...is for one to "evade"
something quickly.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.380
An elegant dodge!

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.920
Anya, Damian, look out!

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.930
You idiot! On your feet already!

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.470
Even if you could read my moves,

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.310
you can no longer dodge
my throw in that position.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.310
Die!

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.520
What the heck?! He just threw the
ball with everything he got!

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.020
I feel bad for her, but
it's her fault for being a klutz.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.480
Don't worry.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.700
I'll be the last man standing
and lead our class to victory.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.720
Hit.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.180
What are you doing, Master Damian?!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.600
Oh, shoot!

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.970
My MVP...!

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.100
You protected me...?

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.560
Huh?!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.350
So you're a nice guy?

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.860
I-It's not like what you think!

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.270
I was just frustrated that we
just kept getting hit by his throws,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.940
so I just wanted to catch his ball...

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.860
Damn it! You're the last
man standing now!

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.280
Don't let me down, okay?!

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.370
My team's future is in my hands now!

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.460
It's now time to
unleash my ultimate strike!

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.840
Here's my last teaching, Anya.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.680
The trick to pitching
is to use the whole body.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.640
Think of this ball as an arrow of light.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.070
I won't let the second
son's death be in vain.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.240
I'm not dead yet!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.360
Anya...

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.200
...will avenge you!

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.790
She's got the power to
send me flying the other day.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.750
So she should be able to...

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.380
I don't really get what's going on,
but she looks so powerful now.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.970
Don't tell me...

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.110
The important thing
is to shift your weight!

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.990
Step forward with power...

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.700
And twist your waist
to transfer the force...

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.410
And then my arm will... Uhh...

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:05.620
Anyway!

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.370
Finisher strike: Star Catch Arrow!!

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:16.000
Huh?

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.260
Wha?

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.930
Ouch!

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:24.390
Huh?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.140
Game set.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.890
Yeah! We won!

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.800
- That was amazing, Bill!

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.680
- Huh?
- That was amazing, Bill!

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.140
- That was amazing, Bill!

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.900
That's a Stella for you now, Bill!

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.270
Hm? Stella?

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.900
Huh?

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.990
You must be daydreaming if you thought
you could get one in this mere mini-game.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.570
Who told you that?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.160
What?!

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.990
In fact,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.990
I might actually
give you a Tonitrus Bolt...

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.200
...for your strong language
during the match.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.580
Don't worry, Bill.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.000
We'll try again next time.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
You'll have another chance.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Still...

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.090
They've been bickering with each other,

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.290
- It was a shame, but you did good!
- yet they joined forces

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.130
- It was a shame, but you did good!
- to face a difficult situation together.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.390
- Such mentality...

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.010
- Come on, cheer up!
- Such mentality...

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.800
- Come on, cheer up!
- ...is worth a Stella, my youths...

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.140
- ...is worth a Stella, my youths...

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.640
Are you kidding me?!

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.390
What the heck was
that lame throw, huh?!

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.850
I regret covering for you!

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:14.600
Shock...

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.690
Come on, you didn't
even hit any of them either!

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.110
I really hate you...

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.570
What did you just say, short legs?!

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.110
You can't say
something like that to a girl!

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.190
- Was that not the case...?

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.990
- You're really a jerk.
- Was that not the case...?

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.610
- Huh?! Say that once again, I dare you!

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.580
- Mother's training is not working.
- Huh?! Say that once again, I dare you!

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.290
- Mother's training is not working.
- Right, right!

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.040
Fighting with each other

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.380
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.780
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.290
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.160
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.430
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.800
I met you

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.490
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.490
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.940
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.070
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:17.620
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.300
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.280
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.420
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.160
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.980
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.710
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.420
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.180
Any and every day is

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.750
A comedy with you

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.590
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.660
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:58.480
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.930
