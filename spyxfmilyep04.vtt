WEBVTT

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.000
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.010
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.680
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.600
On the template of happiness,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.150
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.360
We can't be as we are,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.700
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.790
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.830
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.000
they still don't disappear

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.590
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800
And I know

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220
Every day is so mediocre,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
but I'm here and so are you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.400
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.530
The time has come
for the decisive battle.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.910
Inventory, check.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.160
All good.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.280
Appearances, check.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.870
All good.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.830
Language, check.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.540
Don't worry, Sir!
I got it, Sir!

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.590
Though this is nothing reassuring...

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.260
We've done all we could.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.850
It's time...

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.410
(Mission: 4 - An Interview at a the Prestigious School)

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.700
...for the interview exam at Eden College!
(Mission: 4 - An Interview at a the Prestigious School)

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.350
(Mission: 4 - An Interview at a the Prestigious School)

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.810
So big...!

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.480
It's the top-class school
in the country, after all.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.730
There's a lot of applicants too...

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.110
All of them are our rivals.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.110
Anya, are you okay with this crowd?

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.610
I'm good, Sir!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.450
Let's go, then.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.780
This feeling...

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.700
There's no mistaking it.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.710
I've already felt this
same sensation so many times.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.920
Someone is watching over me.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.790
Could there be an enemy in the crowd?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.590
Enemy?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.710
Feels like someone's watching us...

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.880
No, this isn't it.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.010
Looks like it's not only
me they're watching over.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.600
This probing, unpleasant stare...

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.430
There they are.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.970
Four in the corridor.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.350
Four in the bell tower.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.230
And a few bunch in both buildings.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.820
I have almost the entire list of
officials at this school in my head.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.690
Those are the teachers.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.490
They must be watching
every move we make...

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.910
...judging whether we're
worthy of this school.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.450
In other words,
the exam has already begun.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750
Keep your guard up, people.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.290
We're being watched by the examiners.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.040
Just do as we've practiced.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.590
B-68, fail.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.010
A-12, fail.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.720
G-114, pass.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.300
The quality of this year's
candidates is quite low, I see.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.810
They're all lacking elegance.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.970
Good morning, Master!

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.100
(Eden College - Housemaster)
Good morning, Master!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.640
I am displeased just to have
those crude footsteps...

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.190
...trampling on our elite
Eden College's grounds.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.190
Elegance makes tradition.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.900
Elegance is indeed what makes
the world of man a paradise.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.490
Be sure to disqualify all
families that are inelegant.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.410
Yes, Sir!

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.950
Oh...

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.250
Looks like there are still some
with a touch of elegance.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.920
They're paying respect to
the statue of the first headmaster?!

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.720
I, Twilight, have used hundreds,
if not thousands, of different faces.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.640
It's no big deal to act as
the ideal person they want me to be!

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.680
Look at me!

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.770
I don't really know who
this person might be,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.000
but I guess I'll be fine if I just
do what Loid's doing, right?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.360
Old baldy.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.530
E-Elegant...

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.530
Very elegant!

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.700
Just whoever is that family?!

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.280
K-212, the Forgers.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.790
Their daughter, Anya, barely passed
the written examination with 31 points.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.290
Not elegant!

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.790
The handwriting's so sloppy!

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.000
Did the father get remarried?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.670
Are they an impromptu
family aiming for a seat?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.800
We won't know until we find out...

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.240
Whether they possess the
true quality of elegance...

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.600
We'll check your exam
vouchers over here!

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.520
G-114, please come to Venue 1.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.770
A-12, right?

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.440
Please come to Venue 2.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.000
So they're sifting us out already?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150
K-212, right?

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.940
Please come to Venue 1.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.910
We still have eyes on us.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.950
Stay alert.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.780
It makes me nervous to
think I'm being watched...

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.790
Anya wants to poke
out some boogers.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.910
No, you don't.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.080
Oh, no!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.630
- I'm stuck in a drain and can't get out!

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.590
- Huh... He's obviously trying too hard.
- I'm stuck in a drain and can't get out!

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.670
- Huh... He's obviously trying too hard.
- What should I do now?!

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.460
- Huh... He's obviously trying too hard.
- I really need some help here!

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.340
- No one trying to come near him...
- What should I do now?!

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.300
- ...must be because they think he's nuts.
- I can't believe there's a drain here!

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.380
- But if it's part of the exam,
- I can't believe there's a drain here!

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.220
- then we have to clear it...
- It's a shocking reality!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.850
Ah~ I'm stuck here!

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.480
Father! Mother!
Someone is in trouble, Sir!

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.600
Let's help him, Sir!

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.190
You okay?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.520
My legs are slipping!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.400
- I can't get up!
- This is all for my credit! My credit!

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.490
Right.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.780
One can't possibly ruin their clothing
when they have an interview scheduled.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.910
Now, how will they cut
through this elegantly—

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.880
Are you hurt?

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.090
Here, a handkerchief, Sir.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.590
You should go to the
medical office, just in case.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.590
What a let-down.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.300
So they're just a bunch of
country bumpkins in the end, huh.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.810
Don't think you can set foot
in our school covered in mud.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.940
Get K-212 off the list.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.900
Oh, no... These people are
going to fail because of me...

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.360
Um, I'm sorr—

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.990
I thought this might happen,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.280
so good thing we brought
a change of clothes!

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.780
Who in their right mind
would think this might happen?!

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.870
This gray suit really suits
the school better, right?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.250
I was almost ashamed of myself for
wearing that hillbilly clothing earlier.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.420
Thank you for giving us the chance
to change our clothes, boy.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.010
Huh? O-Okay...

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.510
They even covered for him too?!

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.090
Smart!

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.390
Smart and elegant!

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.390
Curse you, Loid Forger!

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.100
Master, we're examining
the children, though...

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.940
Shut it!

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.400
The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree!

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.190
Right...

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.530
The parents of a child with 31
points must also be worth 31 points!

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.240
I'll take the wind out of their sails...

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.370
Look out!

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.120
The animals have escaped
from the barn!

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.210
You're really going
that far, Eden College?!

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.210
Hey, don't push me!

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.460
So they want to witness
our true nature in an emergency?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.590
We'll be playing right into
their hands if we panic.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.340
Don't break Formation D!

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.720
We must also show
compassion to the animals!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.180
Hey!

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.730
Who told them to go that far?!

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.180
Huh?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.310
Wasn't it you?!

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.650
So this is...

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.110
A real happening?!

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.940
We've got VIPs among the candidates!

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.030
Stop them before someone gets hurt!

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.410
I'm the Vice Minister of Business
at the Ministry of Finance!

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.280
Like hell I'd care!

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.910
I'm the director of the Central Bank!

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.410
Wait! Dad!

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.420
- Good job, son!

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.500
- You okay?
- Good job, son!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.170
- Good job, son!

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.000
Loid!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Anya's not feeling well again...

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.130
The crowd's panicking hit her, huh?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.380
This is no longer an exam, damn it!

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.180
That must be the pack's leader.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.020
I need to use my gun
if I'm to stop him...

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.680
Wait...

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.650
Please hold Anya for me.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:20.440
Yor?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.170
W-W-Wait, you got it wrong!

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.840
I used to take yoga classes and learn the
secret to make someone stop moving!

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.260
So I thought it might
work on a cow too...

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.300
Please don't back away!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.220
The cow... is scared.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.640
Don't go near him, Anya!

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.400
Don't worry, Sir.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.900
Nothing to be scared of.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.400
What are you...

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.910
Everyone's going back home.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.910
Looks like it.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.160
Good thing nobody was injured.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.670
E-Ele-Elelelele...

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.800
Elrerlelrlelrelrlerle...

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.670
Elegance!

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.430
M-Master?!

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.510
Forger!

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.850
If I recall, he's the Housemaster...

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.310
Is he the director for the exam?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.890
Th-Thank you.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.000
You have my gratitude.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.650
Also, I hereby announce defeat for today.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.820
In order to address the situation,
the interview exam will be postponed.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.280
Come back here again
after you've freshened up.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.830
You are all qualified to
have a go at our school.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.080
Sir...

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.460
Looks like we're safe
from getting flunked.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.590
Thank you for your concern.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.960
But worry not.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.470
I knew this might happen,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.970
so we brought another
change of clothes.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.100
They're way beyond elegant!

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.310
They're so adamant, it's scaring me!

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.980
The Forgers have successfully
made it to the interview.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.820
You don't even know that,
yet you're applying to our school?!

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.990
Well? Speak up!

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.780
Ah... Um... Uh...

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.290
Thank you very much.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.000
What's with your answer back there?!

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.840
I've been a spy for many years now.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.010
And today's the first time
I ever feel nervous.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.090
Even when I had to infiltrate a
nefarious terrorist organization...

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.850
And even when I had a close call in
stopping a large missile from launching...

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.310
I'd never felt this suffocated before.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.190
This must be the fear of leaving
success or failure to others...

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.530
Forger family, please come inside.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.400
Yes.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.030
This is, without a doubt...

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.620
...Operation Strix's
most critical moment!

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.490
Excuse us.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.790
So you're finally here, Forger.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.120
The Forger family...

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.500
...shall win this information warfare!

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:35.880
We would like to interview
the parents first, if that's okay.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.210
(Walter Evans (59))
The Headmaster of the Fifth Hall, Malcom.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.010
(Headmaster of the Fifth Hall, Malcom)
The Headmaster of the Fifth Hall, Malcom.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.510
(Subject(s) Taught: National Language)
Warm-hearted, honest, and conservative.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.970
(Personality: Warm-hearted,)
He's also well-trusted by his students.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.770
(honest, and conservative)
He's also well-trusted by his students.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.310
Answering him in a sensible
answer in an honest manner...

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.190
...seemed to guarantee extra points.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.900
I understand that you two are remarried,
but what was your relationship like before?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.320
Starting off with a
personal question, huh.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.320
It's only natural for a school with
a focus on family backgrounds, I suppose.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.410
I met her at the tailor who also
handles your school's uniforms.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.620
I was attracted by
her dignified appearance...

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.540
Though I had been cautious
since my ex-wife's death

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.040
and I had to take care of my daughter...

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.010
But we hit it off over the
course of our conversations.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.890
She's a very kind,
family-oriented person.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.600
I thought she could get
along well with my daughter.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.680
Hmm... What about you, Ma'am?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.980
Um...

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.900
He's a wonderful man
with a great love for his daughter.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.900
He's also been caring for me as well...

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.700
It's good to hear that
you're a happy family.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.410
You've got a pretty face, but why choose
a widower out of all people, Ma'am?

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.790
That's a petulant
question, Mr. Swan.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.580
(Murdoch Swan (47))
The Housemaster of the Second Hall, Cline.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.420
(Housemaster of the Second Hall, Cline)
The Housemaster of the Second Hall, Cline.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.370
(Subject(s) Taught: Economics)
The only son of the previous headmaster,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.590
(Personality: Arrogant, greedy, and insensitive)
he was appointed by nepotism.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.130
(Personality: Arrogant, greedy, and insensitive)
Prideful, greedy, and insensitive.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.420
Prideful, greedy, and insensitive.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.300
Just last month,
he lost custody of his daughter...

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.220
...when his wife forced him a divorce.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.770
After listening to
the interviews so far,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.850
he seems jealous of
the interviewees' families

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.980
and makes all kinds of blatant comments.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.610
It'd be wise to not provoke him.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.270
Let's move on to the next question, then.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.320
Could you please tell us
why you're set on our school?

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.070
The reason for this...

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.420
...is to get closer to my target, Desmond!

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.990
...is the high level
of teachers in your school.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.410
I believe there is no
other school in the world...

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.210
...that can teach my daughter not only
quality knowledge and education,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.080
but also patriotic ideals,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.710
and the elite spirit than the proud
teachers at Eden College.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.420
(Henry Henderson (66))
Elegant indeed, Loid Forger.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.010
(Headmaster of the Third Hall, Cecil)
Elegant indeed, Loid Forger.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.050
(Subject(s) Taught: History)
You are indeed the man I've been expecting.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.090
(Personality: Elegant)
You are indeed the man I've been expecting.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.720
So, from your point of view,
what do you think of your daughter?

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.520
Please tell us about
her strengths and shortcomings.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.400
Anya is a very curious girl.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.070
Although her tendency to poke her nose in
everything can be seen as a shortcoming,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.110
but she's a very clever girl nonetheless.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.700
Clever? Really?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.620
Sometimes she says or does things
as if she can see right through my mind,

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.370
which surprises me.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.710
Her other shortcoming is
that she's a picky eater, I suppose.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.800
All right... So do you have any
education policies of your own, Ma'am?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.130
Just as I've practiced...

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.720
As you're already aware of,
I'm not the biological mother of Anya.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.810
In the beginning, I tend to
pamper her to get her to like me,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:35.980
but I'm trying to be strict every
so often for her future's sake as well.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.320
You mentioned earlier that
your daughter is a picky eater.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.190
What do you usually cook
at home, if we may?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.700
Huh? C-Cook...?

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.490
Um...

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.990
I usually do the cooking at home.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.870
Of course, there are times when
my wife cooks if I'm busy with work.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.410
Though she hasn't
even once done that.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.410
No way!

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.210
How can a wife who
doesn't cook actually exist?!

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.750
You should be strict with yourself first
before you are with your daughter!

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.840
We all have our own
strengths and weaknesses.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.220
She loves cleaning so much
to leave no speck of dust roaming free,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.600
and is impeccable when it comes
to looking after a child.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.680
Huh... They both are what women are
supposed to do in the first place, though.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.480
That's...

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.100
I-It's okay, Loid!

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.020
Now, now...

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.860
That's right.
I need to calm down.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.820
What are you so upset about, Twilight?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.610
She's not even your real
wife in the first place.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.320
A lovey-dovey, good-looking couple?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.700
It makes my skin crawl.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.410
I'll just be picky
and expose their defects!

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.000
It'd be unfair if we were
to let these lot...

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.560
...enroll at this school.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.290
He's hating Father and Mother!

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.000
I need to do my best!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.010
L-Let's move on to the
questions for the daughter now.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.010
Here it comes!

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.090
Could you tell us your
name and address, Miss?

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.800
I'm Anya Forger!

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.600
My address is in Berlint West...

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.690
Park Avenue 1...

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.310
28!

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.560
What do you do on the weekends?

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.000
I go to an art gallery, and eat an opera...

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.110
All right. So far it's exactly
the same as we've practiced.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.490
What do you want to do
once you're in school?

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.490
Um... Um...

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.490
What should I say, again?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.450
In my case,

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.660
I'll infiltrate the social gathering first,
and uncover the secret plans...

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.810
...of the enemy organization,
and Desmond, their boss.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.500
I want to uncover the secrets
of the organization's boss!

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.050
What are you saying, kid?!

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.590
The organization's boss...?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.510
Do you mean the headmaster?

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.100
Excuse me. My daughter can be
more ambitious than most...

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.890
And she's so curious about the headmaster,
who has climbed his way to the top.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.770
Oh...

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.690
That attitude of trying to learn from her
predecessors at such a young age....

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.310
Quite elegant, if I say so.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.690
Then, could you tell the name
of that headmaster, Miss?

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.030
Um... B-Be...

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.200
Yes. Benedict Ivan Goodfeller.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.700
Benedikt Ifan Goodfella!

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:01.210
Right... And what do you think you
should do to make it big like he did?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.000
I'll survive the jungle all by myself,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.510
and train my mental through
a series of death-defying tests!

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.720
That's what the main character of
yesterday's spy show was doing.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.390
Wh-What firm resolve!

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.310
I think I might have
underestimated this girl!

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.230
You don't need to go so far, though.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.400
Let's change the topic, then.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.690
What does your father do for a living?

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.030
Sp—

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.490
Splendid doctor with a splendid heart!

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.110
Hm? Is your nose getting stuffy?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.990
Then, what do you think
of your new mother?

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.200
She's so kind!

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.500
But she's scary sometimes!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.460
If you gave your father and
mother a score, what would it be?

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.300
A perfect 100!

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.010
I love both my father and
mother because they are fun!

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.590
I want to be with them forever!

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.720
Tch... Come on,
I don't need to hear that.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.890
So who scores higher?
Your old mama or your new mama?

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.650
Mr. Swan...!

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:04.350
You have a problem?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.400
I implore you to change the question.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.610
No, I won't.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.110
If she won't answer,
you'll lose points.

00:18:10.118 --> 00:18:12.248
I don't know how she
ended up in the orphanage,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.490
but I'm sure her real parents are already...

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.040
Anya...

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.210
Mama...

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.050
Oh, I see!

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.380
So you prefer your old mama, huh!

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.680
You're way out of line, Sir!

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.880
Yor, calm down.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.640
But he...

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.220
We have to endure it for the mission.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.390
We have a lot of boarding students
who have moved away from their parents.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.310
You won't make it at this school...

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.360
...if you're crying over
some trivial matters!

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.070
What does it matter
if you're being slandered?

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:50.820
- We're only a pretend family in the end.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.900
- Trivial...?
- We're only a pretend family in the end.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.690
- We're only a pretend family in the end.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.990
Trivial, you say...?

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.820
That's all there is to it.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.700
What's wrong, Ma'am?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.620
Don't bite me just because
you lost to his previous wife!

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.800
Phew... That was satisfy—

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.710
Endure it, Twilight!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.470
Excuse me.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.220
There was a mosquito on the table.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.600
Thank you for today, gentlemen.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.720
Hey! Where are you going?!

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.230
We're not done yet!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.610
If it's your educational philosophy
to disregard the feelings of children,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.730
then looks like I've
chosen the wrong school.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.610
You dare to insult our school?!

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.700
Come on, you two.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.950
Have a good day, gentlemen.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.200
Don't think you can
set foot in our school again!

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.620
That's going too far, Mr. Swan.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.790
Are you unhappy with my methods?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.410
Although he's no longer in charge,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.880
- Now, now...
- my father's influence is still well.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.090
You'd better watch your mouth next time.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.680
Hey! Call in the next one already!

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.390
...Than the proud
teachers at Eden College.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.310
I'm not qualified to be an educator
if I only cower behind authority.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.900
I wonder who actually
insulted our school.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.570
Huh?!

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.200
Quite an elegant punch,
if I say so myself.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.100
I hope you can see me as
a proud teacher of Eden again, Forger.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.920
We're definitely going to fail...

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.180
I'll brew us tea or something...

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.430
Yet another blunder as a spy...

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.350
I showed unneeded
emotions on the mission.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.310
Father.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.890
I'm sorry.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:54.860
I'm sorry I didn't do better on the exam.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.480
It's okay, Anya.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.070
You don't have to apologise.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.700
You don't want to go to that school, right?

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.910
Anya wants to go to school...

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:06.870
Hm?

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.330
I have to go to school,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.710
or the mission will fail...

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.840
And you'll leave me...

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.840
Anya...

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.930
If she doesn't pass,
then this life will be...

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.180
Well...

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.600
I was just concerned about this
interfering with my work, that's all...

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.310
Hmm... But honestly,
there's no way we could pass.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.320
I-I'm sure it'll work out somehow!

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.610
Please have faith!

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.990
The old men with the glasses and
one glass were nice people!

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.320
She's right!

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.410
I'm sure they'll cover for us!

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.830
Let's believe in them!

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.290
A spy should believe
in nothing but himself.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.840
He must always prepare for
the worst case scenario.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.340
I want to be with them forever!

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.890
But, yeah...
Maybe I should...

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:04.720
Right.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.390
Whatever will be, will be.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.970
For now, let's just say that we've
done a great job on the exam.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.480
Just... for now...

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.230
To the bright future of our family!

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.240
Something just fell!

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.990
Our family picture fell...

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.200
It did...

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.990
How will the mission turn out?

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.040
Fighting with each other

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.380
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.780
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.290
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.160
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.430
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.800
I met you

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.490
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.490
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.940
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.070
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:17.620
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.300
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.280
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.420
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.160
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.980
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.710
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.420
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.180
Any and every day is

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.750
A comedy with you

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.590
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.660
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:58.480
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.930
(Mission: 5 - Pass or Fail?)
