00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:15.974
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:22.856
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:28.987
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:34.659
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.579
On the template of happiness,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.124
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:45.336
We can't be as we are,

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:50.675
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:57.766
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.810
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.980
they still don't disappear

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.565
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.568
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.779
And I know

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.199
Every day is so mediocre,

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:18.995
but I'm here and so are you

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:25.376
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.469
(Eden Academy's Designated Uniform Retailers)

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.268
99.5 cm...

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.979
Anya's got 2 mm taller than before!

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.397
Probably just an error, right?

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:47.857
Who can tell?

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:50.485
Children are so quick
in growing up, after all.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.528
Right they are.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:55.198
Then I guess we'll just make it
a bit bigger in case she grows taller.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.786
But still... I can't believe
you're married already, Yor.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:04.165
You could've told me when
you visited us the other day, though!

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.960
I'm sorry... for not letting
you know back then.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.506
And your daughter's going
to the prestigious Eden, too!

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:12.966
Congrats.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.051
Thank very much.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:18.096
Are you an Eden alumnus too, Sir?

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:18.888
No.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.141
I went to a third-rate school
in the countryside...

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.768
Oh, you should be careful, then.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.478
Eden really upholds traditional values,

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:29.065
and I heard there are barriers between
alumni and non-alumni parents,

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.986
and that gives birth to discrimination
and bullying among the children.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.947
There's also the case of violence
by scholarship students,

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.825
and the discord between boarding
students and commuting students...

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:43.830
Huh... Looks like commuting students are
frequently kidnapped these days, too.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.750
Only the rich are able
to go to Eden, after all.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.336
Anya won't be going to school.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.296
Huh?!

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.089
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.550
I didn't mean to scare you.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.678
There are also lots of
fun things there, so it's okay!

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.388
Okay, we're done here.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.184
So... your orders are a uniform set,

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.979
a winter coat, and a sweater vest.
That makes it three, then.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.399
Since you're a regular customer,
we'll have them ready fast.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.695
Oh, you can find other required items
in the shop in the corner of the street.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.739
That's a lot of money.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.536
Hm? What's wrong?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.580
I'm scared of kidnappers.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.581
Oh, really?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.082
Getting to it already, aren't you?

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.753
Do you mind if we eat outside today, Yor?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.546
Sure!

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.841
No kidnapper in restaurant?

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.843
Here's our recommendation for today:

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:42.513
Pork sautÃ© with powpaw sauce and porcini,

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:45.475
and potato potage.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.476
Po?

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.435
Looks delicious.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.603
Code P, huh.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.272
A call for briefing, I see.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:55.568
Five days from now at
13:00 in Safe House D.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.195
Roger that.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.740
But they really need to
stop contacting me like this.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.492
It's kind of bugging me.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:05.495
(5 Days Later)

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.579
Yes.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.081
Oh, hello.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.500
Oh, they're done already?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.584
All right.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.002
We'll come by to pick them up today.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:14.504
See you, then.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.008
My uniform's done?!

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:20.760
Looks like it.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.763
However, today's the day for briefing.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.765
Sorry to trouble you, Yor,

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.101
but could you take Anya
with you there as well?

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.520
I've got work to do.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.563
Of course.

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:34.065
Leave it to me.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:37.068
I might be coming home late,

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.779
so feel free to order
something for dinner tonight.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.655
Okay.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.532
Safe trip.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.399
Good afternoon,
(WISE Administrator, Sylvia Sherwood)

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.775
or good evening, agent Twilight.
(WISE Administrator, Sylvia Sherwood)

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.277
or good evening, agent Twilight.
(Nickname: Handler)

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:22.071
Hello, Handler.

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:23.323
What's the business?

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:26.326
Before that...

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.578
What's up with the high
expense the other day?!

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.289
Castle and royal furniture rental fees?!

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.207
You trying to screw
with our wise budget?!

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.293
And here are some additional invoices.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.211
School admission is
a lot of work, I suppose.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.964
I commend your bravery for
handing those nonchalantly.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.133
These and those are
necessary expenses.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.593
Fine, then.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.218
So...

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.848
We'd like to confirm the execution for
Phase 2 of Operation Strix with you.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.726
Though, I don't think a wise
agent like you would need this.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.102
Well...

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.938
I've been leaving things
to chance lately, so...

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.775
Phase 2: The Social Gathering.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.445
For the purpose of this briefing,
we'll review the system in Eden.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.572
Eden College.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.991
Around 2,500 students are
admitted to this school.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.453
With a total of 13 grades
from 6 to 19 years of age.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.580
Scholarship, sports, and arts.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.958
It's a top-class educational
institution excelling in various fields.

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.379
And the best and most talented students
are hand-picked in that elite school.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.007
They are the scholarship students,
dubbed the Imperial Scholars.

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:26.010
In order for you to attend
Desmond's social gathering,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.348
your daughter must be part
of this Imperial Scholars.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.475
And in order for your daughter
to become a scholarship student,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.479
she must gather eight medals
of merit, dubbed the Stella Stars.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.939
The medals are awarded

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.608
for outstanding academic performance
and contribution to society.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.360
In other words,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.780
you must first raise your daughter
until she becomes an honour student.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.617
Feel free to use any means
necessary to achieve this.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.285
And in contrast,

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:53.579
your daughter will be
awarded the Tonitrus Bolts

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.374
for poor academic
performances and misconducts.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:07:00.253
Gather eight of these, and it's
instant expulsion for her, so be careful.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:02.880
- Now for the detailed plan discussion...

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.007
- Raise her to become an honour student...
- Now for the detailed plan discussion...

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:08.261
The kid's nothing but a source of concern.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.767
Does Anya look cute in a uniform?

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.894
So cute, so cute!

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.646
Let's go to a photo studio later!

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.650
Baa!

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.068
Does Anya look cute?

00:07:24.068 --> 00:07:26.612
So cute, so cute!

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:28.406
Just go home already, will you?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.407
That's ten times already.

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:32.493
Anya wants to go for a wok with this!

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:33.786
Let's do it, then!

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.582
Come again!

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.377
La-la-la-la-la~

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:43.588
Should we visit the park as well?

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.883
It's Anya in a uniform!

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.508
Baa!

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:49.177
It's Anya in a uniform!

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:49.886
Baa!

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.347
What a cute daughter you have.

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:56.100
She's going to Eden?

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.186
Wow, I'm so jealous...

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.271
Oh... hello.

00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:03.065
Mom, I'm hungry.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:05.067
What do you want for lunch?

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.069
Salisbury steak!

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.658
So you prefer your old mama, huh!

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.077
I want to be with them forever!

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.791
I know that we're just a fake family...

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:21.584
But...

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:24.378
I wonder if I...

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:27.381
...could act like a proper mother for her?

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.885
Mother!

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.597
Anya has shown Anya's
cuteness to everyone!

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.892
Come on, you can't dirty your
uniform before the entrance ceremony.

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:39.769
Say, Anya.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.271
Why don't we drop by the supermarket?

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.147
Hm?

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:45.900
Loid said he'll be
coming home late tonight,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.985
so I'll make you dinner!

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:48.819
Oh!

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:50.404
Can you?

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:52.698
Yes! I'll do my best!

00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:56.369
Hey, is that Eden's uniform?

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:56.953
Hm?

00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.997
So the woman next to her is the mom?

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:01.457
Must be a maid, right?

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:04.794
What kind of rich guys
would go shopping by themselves?

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:08.089
Oh, I could use some allowances now.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:09.465
Me too.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.971
Well, as long as there's meat
and vegetables, I should be good, right?

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.557
I can't tell which one and
what kind I should buy,

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.600
so I'll just buy every one of them.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.518
Baa!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.313
Anya will wait outside,
it's boring here!

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:25.940
Don't go too far away, okay!

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:32.947
Good day, Princess.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.491
Be a good girl for us, okay?

00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.287
We'll let you go once we've
got allowances from your maid.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.496
Bad guys...!

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.000
Bullying and kidnapping
tend to happen at Eden...

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:46.460
It's real...!

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:51.924
I heard this uniform sells for a lot.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.175
Oh, that's nice.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.844
Now, Miss. If you could take offâ

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.602
What are you doing...?

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.395
Oh, boy!

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.981
You gotta pay extra for the hospital now!

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.066
Give me your wallet, maid.

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:12.778
I've used all the money in my
wallet, so there's none left.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.947
So please, take it.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.449
Oh, really?

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.285
Then we'll just strip this girl
down and be done with her.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.455
You'll be losing your job anyway,

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.625
so just go back to the
countryside, you shitty maid!

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.380
W-With bare hands...?!

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.218
I am her mother!

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:38.763
If you don't want to end
up like those vegetables,

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.514
get out of here right now!

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.185
Mother...

00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:47.396
Are you okay?

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:50.900
I'm sorry. It's all because
I took my eyes off you...

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.151
There, there...

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.363
I've messed up our groceries, too...

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.740
I'm really a bad mother...

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:06.290
Anya loves a strong and cool mother!

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.625
There, there.

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:10.628
Finisher punch! Bam!

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.797
Y-You're embarrassing me...

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:13.964
Mother!

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.092
Train Anya how to do it!

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.343
T-Train?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.098
I know it's dangerous
to be Eden's student.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:26.560
But if I train and become
stronger, it won't be scary!

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.355
I can do my best at school
without having to die!

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.982
I want to be like you!

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:37.488
Though I can't act like a normal mother...

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:40.991
I'll just have to do
my best at what I can!

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:41.867
All right.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.078
Let's go home and train now.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:44.995
Training!

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.626
I'm home.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:51.669
Hah!

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:52.878
Hah!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.713
Hm?

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.297
What are you two doing?

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:56.799
Preparing for school!

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.717
Hah!

00:11:58.384 --> 00:11:59.176
Hah!

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.177
Hah!

00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:00.761
- This is really nothing but worrying.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:01.846
- Hah!
- This is really nothing but worrying.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:02.930
Hah!

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:08.436
You all are the chosen ones.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.396
Through your own efforts,

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:13.482
and those of your parents,
you have successfully passed...

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:16.694
...through the narrow gates
of our Eden Academy.

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:21.866
To our glorious 228
new members of our school,

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.285
I congratulate you on joining us!

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:27.788
The whole Eden Academy
community warmly welcomes you all.

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:31.000
I've finally made it this far.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.170
Father, there's a lot of people
wearing the same clothes as Anya!

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.505
Yes. That's what you call a uniform.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:39.884
I still have mountains of problems, but...

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.385
Look, Twilight.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:44.889
There's a condition if you want to
participate in Desmond's social gathering.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:48.267
That is, your daughter must be
selected as one of the Imperial Scholars.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.687
To do this, she will have to
be first in various subjects.

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:57.818
Remember, the future of the East
and West depends on this operation.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.987
Making this girl an elite student...

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.573
I'm halfway through giving up on that.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:03.824
Shock!

00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:06.994
It's a bit of a stretch for her to always
be the best in this school,

00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:09.789
which attracts just
exactly the best students.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:10.623
Besides...

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:15.795
Next, we will now announce the class
placements and the homeroom teachers.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.088
Please come forward when I say your name.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.716
Class 1, the Spectre Hall.

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:22.134
William Howard.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.346
Theodore Russel.

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.473
Grace Fain.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.599
Jessica Clarke.

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:30.476
- Next is Class 2, the Cline Hall.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:32.353
- Which class will Anya be in?
- Next is Class 2, the Cline Hall.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.479
- I wonder about that, too.
- Next is Class 2, the Cline Hall.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:34.480
Lucy Garrett.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.566
Actually, I know it already.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.859
- Because I altered some of

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.152
- Class 3, Cecil Hall.
- Because I altered some of the

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:42.238
class arrangements to suit the mission.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.781
Alice Paulet.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.366
- Edward Berkshire.
- So that Anya will be...

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:48.077
Damian Desmond.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.995
...in the same class as that kid.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.543
Target: Donovan Desmond's
second son, Damian.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.045
That's Master Damian for you, Sir.

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.298
He followed in his brother's
footsteps and got into Eden.

00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:04.176
I've already marked his name
when I found it on the candidate list.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.594
Jesse Capel.

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:10.599
He's my Plan B in case of trouble on
making Anya an Imperial Scholar member.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:12.560
I call it "Operation Buddy-Buddy"!

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.811
(Mission: 6 - Operation Buddy-Buddy)

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.896
1. Be in the same class as him
(Mission: 6 - Operation Buddy-Buddy)

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.481
and become buddy-buddy-like with him.

00:14:17.481 --> 00:14:18.566
2. Get invited by him

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.693
(Come on in!)
along with her parent, that is me.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.235
3. Come into direct contact with my target.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.737
(Welcome!) (Hello!)
3. Come into direct contact with the target.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.782
Though I don't think it'll go so smoothly,

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:28.284
but it's always good to have insurance.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.410
Anya Forger.

00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:31.662
Go on now.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.207
Back in the orphanage,

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:38.252
Anya had lived together with
so many children of her age.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.505
I'll just believe
in her communication skills.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.758
The child of the evil boss...

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.386
What's up with her...?

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.762
Oh, don't tell me...

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:52.308
She's fallen for my
handsomeness at first sight already?

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.727
She's got a keen eye, huh?

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.771
What a shy girl...

00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:59.189
That's cute.

00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:00.983
Becky Blackbell.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:01.692
Sigh...

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:03.986
Nice to meet you!

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:06.947
Hm? That kid...

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.576
She's the daughter of the CEO of
a major military company, Blackbell!

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.871
Behind her is the daughter of
the vice chairman of the Parliament!

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:16.790
And there's the son of a VIP in the
Security Service among the boys too!

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.169
Her classmates are a gold mine of Intel!

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:23.088
You gotta get along with them, Anya!

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.133
He's so hell-bent when it
comes to his daughter, I see.

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.593
I'm Becky.

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.886
What's your name?

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:30.054
She looks so childish.

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.806
I could at least be
her caretaker, I guess.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:34.975
Huh?!

00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.518
Hey!

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:40.022
The homeroom teacher
will be Mr. Henderson.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.691
Oh, the nice teacher!

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:44.777
So he wasn't fired, after all.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.196
It seems unfair that a housemaster
is demoted to a homeroom teacher...

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.572
...for the grade students,

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:51.283
but I guess he's lucky enough
to have this as a punishment.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.745
Hm... I'll go back to the basics
and properly educate them.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:55.871
Ah...

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:59.166
Now, please follow your homeroom teachers...

00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:02.586
...as they give you a tour on the school,
and head to your respective classroom.

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:06.382
As for the parents,
please wait in Ward C's lounge...

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:09.301
...and have a pleasant chat with each other.

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.803
I'm counting on you, Anya.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.764
You have to figure things out
on your own from now.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:16.892
Okey-dokey!

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.727
You there! Stay in line!

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:19.895
Huh!

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:22.231
Oh, this is so worrying...

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:24.608
Seeing your daughter off
really makes you anxious, right?

00:16:24.608 --> 00:16:25.776
I feel you.

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:28.779
This is the cafeteria.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.908
Our first-class chefs serve
elegant food here every day.

00:16:33.367 --> 00:16:34.785
And beyond those doors...

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:38.539
...is another cafeteria exclusive
to the Imperial Scholars.

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.874
Anyone can become a Scholar,

00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:44.586
as long as you do elegantly in class,
and receive eight Stella Stars.

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:47.089
You will do your best to be diligent now.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.132
Yes, Sir!

00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.259
In contrast, there are also punishments...

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.429
and expulsions depending on the
amount of Tonitrus Bolts you have,

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.471
so bear that in mind.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.390
Why is he looking at me?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.560
I bet you'll be a Scholar
in no time, Master Damian!

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.894
Obviously.

00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:02.479
Of course!

00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:05.566
I'm the son of the chairman of
the National Unity Party, you see.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:06.775
- Huh?! Really?!
- Wow!

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:09.987
My papa said that Desmond Group
has been a great help to our family!

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:10.571
Hey!

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.448
Enough with the chit-chat!

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:13.782
That's just ridiculous.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.579
What about you?

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.581
What does your dad do?

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.917
Depending on the job level, I might
consider adding you to my friend list.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.296
I must endure it for the mission.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.673
A Spâ splendid heart doctor.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.801
So he's no big shot, huh.

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:34.678
I bet you're not even that rich.

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:35.679
Lame.

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.890
Anya wants to go to your house to play.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.684
How dare you!
Know your place, pig!

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.895
What a brazen commoner we have here.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.439
I'll catch your commoner germs, so get!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.985
All right, time to unleash the
finisher punch now!

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.195
Look, Anya.

00:17:51.695 --> 00:17:52.488
Huh!

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:55.199
Those who let their emotions
get the better of them...

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:57.284
...and assert their strength
can't be considered truly strong.

00:17:57.284 --> 00:17:59.078
If you're just being teased,

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.830
just put on a smile, and you'll do fine.
Like a cool big sister.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.457
Big sister...!

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:07.669
Also, a smile a day keeps a fight away.

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.171
You're so pathetic!

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:11.298
At least say something back to them!

00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:14.468
Anya doesn't mind it a bit.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:15.594
Huh...?!

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.098
Heh.

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:22.976
Wh-What the heck's that
condescending smile for?!

00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.186
So much leeway!

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:26.396
She's just like an adult! Amazing!

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:28.732
I was mistaken to have
thought of her as childish!

00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:30.734
You're surprisingly mature enough, huh!

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:32.236
I see you in a new light now!

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.487
Mature...

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.076
Heh...

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:42.788
Don't get so carried away, you pig!

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.581
You pig, pig, pig!

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.376
Master Damian, please
do mind your vocabulary...

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.794
What?

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.546
Sure, she's as ugly as a pig
compared to me,

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.214
but you don't have to go so far, do you?

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.632
Shut up!

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:56.009
You there! How many
times do I have to tell you?!

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:58.137
You want a bolt already on your first day?!

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.596
Damn!

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:02.474
How dare you put me to shame...
You won't get away with this!

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.685
You're a liar, Mother.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:06.562
The smile does nothing.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:14.486
Heh.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:17.656
Cut it out already, or I'll report you!

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:20.075
You got proof that we did it?

00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:21.410
Right, right!

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.162
Out of the way.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.914
Hey, smirking pig.

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:29.668
I'm going to bully you to
my heart's content from now.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:33.255
And I'm also going to rip that smirk off
your face that you can't use it again.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:36.675
Even if she starts crying,
her heart doctor papa will cure him!

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.761
Wow, now that's amazing!

00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:41.096
Good for you, eh!

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.684
Hey, where are you looking?

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.977
You scared?

00:19:58.655 --> 00:19:59.990
What's going on there?!

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.076
Sir! This girl just hit Master Damian!

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:03.785
Huh!

00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:06.538
I was just stretching out my hand
and he happened to be in front of me...

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.497
Liar!

00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:09.541
Why are you trying to fool him?!

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:12.794
Wait, you were actually checking if Mr.
Henderson was watching us earlier, right?!

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:15.172
You got proof that I did it?

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.508
Isn't this enough proof of
your big, heavy punch?!

00:20:19.092 --> 00:20:23.764
I would be ashamed of myself
if I testified perjury, Anya Forger.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.267
You've got it wrong, Sir!

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.561
She's been holding back the whole time,

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.687
but these guys...

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.233
So it's true that you did hit him.

00:20:36.193 --> 00:20:37.819
Look, Anya.

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:38.779
Huh!

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.906
The right time to use force...

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:45.244
...is, for example, when you have to help
your friend in a tight spot...

00:20:47.871 --> 00:20:50.499
H-He stepped...

00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.584
...on her foot earlier...

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:55.504
So Anya got mad...

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:57.214
I'm sorry...

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.801
You did it for me?!

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.177
Anya...

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.389
- Thank you!
- While she contained her personal resentment,

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.890
- she also has the spirit

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.101
- I'm so touched!
- to stand firm against boys

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.394
for the sake of her friend.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:13.772
Elegant indeed, Anya Forger.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.357
However...

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:20.487
So Desmond and his wife
never showed up, huh.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:22.990
Well, there's no rush.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.574
As long as Anya's admitted here,

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:26.076
- Attention, please!
- I have all the time I need.

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.286
- The students have finished
- I've also developed

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.787
- with their orientation,
- a reasonable network of contacts.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.497
so please gather at the courtyard.

00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.874
We'll be doing a group photo shoot there.

00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:34.459
Where's Anya?

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.377
Forger.

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:37.254
Come with me.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.881
She hit a boy...?

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:41.466
Are you hurt?

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.509
And it's Desmond's son,

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:43.593
- out of all people...
- In a normal case,

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.137
- What the heck happened...?
- an act of violence results in

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:46.888
an instant three Tonitrus Bolts.

00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:49.891
But I used my discretion
and only gave her one.

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:52.269
No further concessions can be made.

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:54.980
I'm sorry, Loid!

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.149
It's because I trained her
for the finisher punch...

00:21:57.149 --> 00:22:00.652
I'll inform the boy's parents as well.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.195
(Plan A - Plan B)
We've lost a point already

00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:03.864
(Plan A - Plan B)
on the first day of school...

00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.157
(Plan A - Plan B)
And Anya's relationship with Damian

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.783
(Plan A - Plan B)
has plummeted, too...

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:11.288
All right! I'm taking the picture now!

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:15.000
You three on the far right!
Come on, smile more!

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.084
Cheese!

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:38.732
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:44.237
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:48.116
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.116 --> 00:22:54.414
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:55.749
I met you

00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:57.459
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.462
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:05.926
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:10.055
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:17.604
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:20.273
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:23.235
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:28.365
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:31.118
Shall we hold hands and head home?

What should we eat tonight?

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:36.665
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:40.377
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.377 --> 00:23:42.129
Any and every day is

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:44.714
A comedy with you

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:47.551
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:51.638
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:58.437

ridiculous everyday life
