00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.625
What's your mission today?

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:41.583
-Save the hostages, sir.
-Save the hostages, sir.

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:43.375
What?

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.166
-Save the hostages, sir.
-Save the hostages, sir.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.083
Kill the hostages is more like it.

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:52.583
Such a cute and innocent girl
was killed by you.

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:54.833
Can't you differentiate
between friend and foe?

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.333
Did I tell you
how many hostages there are?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.541
No, sir.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.541
So you thought there's only me.

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:04.625
And you, you were firing while jumping.
It's so cool, right?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.791
You didn't look behind you.
Is your back made of steel?

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.666
If she wasn't there,
I would have gotten up.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.291
Then I'd get shot by you.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:19.333
Then you have to take care of my funeral
and also provide for my parents.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.458
Look at you, can you afford it?

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.625
Have you gotten enough scolding?

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:26.958
Yes, sir.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.000
Good. From now on,
there will be no more scolding from me.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:34.166
Starting tomorrow, I'll be promoted,
get a raise, live in a mansion,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.500
and have an imported dog.

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.083
You're on your own.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.791
Are you really happy that I'm leaving?

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:52.833
Let me tell you.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.958
I'm happier than you.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.166
Inspector Chow, your file isn't here yet.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.625
Madam will see you in a while.

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.166
Hey...

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.500
Nothing.

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:20.750
I know you may think I'm boasting,

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:22.958
but think about it.

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:26.875
I'll be giving out orders
in that room later.

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:30.333
How can I not be proud of myself?

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:31.666
I'm brokenhearted.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.750
I'm finally getting promoted.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.541
I'm brokenhearted.

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.125
Brokenhearted!

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:41.500
-You're brokenhearted?
-Yes.

00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:43.833
Is that possible? You've dated before?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.541
-No.
-That's right.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:46.958
We're pen pals.

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:48.625
Pen pals?

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.166
We've corresponded for three years.

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.166
Recently, she stopped writing to me.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.333
Why?

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.541
Because I sent her a photo.

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:57.166
You asked for it then.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.541
Look at yourself,
how can you send your picture?

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:02.250
Yes, that's why I sent yours.

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:04.375
-My picture?
-Yes, your picture.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.333
Then she never wrote me back
after she saw it.

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.375
Well, it's not your fault.

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.208
It's not a sin to have an ugly face.

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:27.208
What is love,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.875
that it moves us to live or die?

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.583
It's confusing

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:43.750
and makes us feel helpless.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:47.458
Your mom--

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.291
Did I ask for cold water?

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.041
Have you ever seen me
drink cold water before?

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:58.666
No.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.625
Then why did you pour me cold water?

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.083
Behave, this is a police station.

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:03.125
So what?

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:05.375
I like to hit her and she likes it.

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:07.041
So what?

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:09.541
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:10.833
-Speak up.
-Yes.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:12.291
-Louder!
-Yes!

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:13.791
Then go and get me water.

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.458
Are you jealous that I have
lots of women? I don't care.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.000
You're getting a statement?

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:21.541
-Let me do it.
-Yes, sir.

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:22.958
-Come here.
-Where?

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.541
-Over here.
-I'm coming now.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.833
Hey, you're just asking me questions.
Do you need to use a hammer?

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:31.666
Asking questions? I'll beat you first.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.333
-Hold him, don't let him move.
-Hey...

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:34.625
-Wait.
-Hey.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.125
-What are you doing?
-Sit still!

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:37.958
Tat...

00:06:38.416 --> 00:06:41.583
-This isn't according to the rules.
-Have you questioned suspects before?

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.375
No, but you'll get in trouble
if you hurt him.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.041
How would I hurt him?

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.333
I'll put a phone book on this chest
and hit it with the hammer.

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:49.791
They won't find any wounds.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:51.666
There's no need to create trouble
at this time.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.000
-Do you have a phone book?
-Hey, no.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:53.916
Why are there no phone books

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.208
-in such a big station?
-I don't think I brought it. Here it is.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.750
Yes! That would do. Put it on his chest.

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.041
-I really don't agree with this.
-It's fine. Put it here or he'll get hurt.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.708
-Come, put it here.
-Hey.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:04.791
I'll count to three.

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:08.125
Sir, your phone book is so small.
It will kill me.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.083
Open it.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.166
At the count of three.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.000
It will still kill me.

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:15.250
-Take your hands off! Hold him.
-No.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:16.250
-Hold him.
-Hey...

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:17.833
It's not my fault, I'm forced to do so.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.083
-At the count of three.
-Hey, stop playing around.

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:22.250
-Hurry up.
-Hey.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:23.375
Two.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.041
Hey.

00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:28.375
Do you want to die?

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:32.666
Release him, I want
to fight him one-on-one.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.625
-What the hell?
-Release him!

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.041
Fine, do whatever you want.

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:41.791
Are you fighting with me or him?

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:43.000
Him.

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:54.791
-Sing.
-What?

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.041
Relay.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.625
-Didn't you say you want a one-on-one?
-It's the same if you do it.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:00.041
I knew it.

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:12.375
Want to do some wrestling, man?

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.583
My turn. Relay...

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:32.875
Sing, relay.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.583
I'm so ashamed to know you.

00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.375
Stop talking. Hurry, come...

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:40.541
Hurry...

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.500
-Hey, give me a cigarette.
-Dream on, it's 1.5 dollars per piece.

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:56.375
Relay...

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:57.500
Again?

00:08:57.708 --> 00:08:58.625
Let's see.

00:08:58.708 --> 00:08:59.750
You asked for it.

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:20.375
Why did you beat up the plaintiff?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.041
Such a big man hit a woman.
He deserves it.

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.583
I hate men who don't respect women.

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.000
You can report me if you think I'm wrong.

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.416
I want to file a complaint.
A policeman beat me up.

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.625
Are your files here?

00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:35.791
Not yet.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.375
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:41.833
According to our procedures,
these two aren't policemen anymore.

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:42.833
What?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.708
Are you kidding me?
Then why did they beat me up?

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:49.208
The government never jokes around.
We act according to reason.

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:52.125
If you really want to sue these men,

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.041
I can only charge...

00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.083
the three of you for fighting.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.750
-Are you interested in that?
-Yes!

00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:02.750
You let these mad dogs beat me up?
Why? Tell me.

00:10:03.458 --> 00:10:05.708
I want to report him! And him!

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.750
I'll report you too, bitch!

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:10.541
Don't think that I wouldn't recognize you
because it's dark in here.

00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:14.833
I'll remember you the most.
You're short, fat, and wrinkled!

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.208
You poked my eyes!

00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:19.833
I'm the head of this district.

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:22.083
If you want to report me, come to me.

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:23.416
Did anyone see me poke his eyes?

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.333
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.000
Then I'll do it one more time.

00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:28.875
I'll kick you too.

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:31.083
Report me and see if anybody believes you!

00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:32.583
You're dismissed.

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:34.875
Did anyone see me kick him?

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:35.916
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:37.958
Do you see me as short, fat, and wrinkled?

00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:39.166
-No.
-No.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:44.250
Madam, that was a misunderstanding.

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.791
-But a lot--
-I, Tso Tat-wah, am responsible for it.

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:50.583
I was happy to hit that bastard earlier.

00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:54.125
If you think I'm wrong, Madam,
you can fire me anytime.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:11:00.125
You two did very well
in the firearms case last month.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:04.458
-Yes, because--
-That's nothing, it's our duty.

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:05.708
Nothing special.

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:08.875
Don't be so humble.
What do you want to do?

00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.583
Which department is the most dangerous
in the police force?

00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:13.083
Regional Crime Unit.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.708
I want to go to the Regional Crime Unit.

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.958
If you go there, what about me?

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:21.500
I'll go to the Traffic Unit then? Gosh.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.750
CONNECT BY AIR AND LAND THROUGH HO KEE

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.708
What exactly have I done wrong?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.833
Hopeless.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.041
I'm doomed.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:33.000
Turn off the engine.
License and ID, please.

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.708
We're in big trouble.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.458
-It's Sing.
-It's Sing!

00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:39.750
-Hey!
-Sing!

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:41.000
He used to be our leader.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:43.291
-We don't need to be afraid.
-You guys are becoming stupider.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.708
-You're funny.
-Hey...

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:47.375
Sing, we're fine, right?

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:49.625
You guys are lucky. You met me this time.

00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:51.375
You won't be as lucky next time.
Be careful.

00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:53.208
-We can go then?
-Go.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.958
Why were you so unlucky to be
demoted to a traffic policeman?

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:57.916
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:13:58.041 --> 00:13:59.458
Turn off the engine.

00:13:59.541 --> 00:14:01.041
License and ID, please.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.916
Stop joking around.
We're going to have dim sum.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.250
Ignore him.

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:07.833
I'm definitely not joking.

00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.041
Get out of the car,
put both hands on your head.

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:12.666
Hold them tight.

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:16.791
I'm now charging you for dangerous
driving and attempted murder.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.416
I'm not the driver--

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:21.791
You had sexual intercourse
with an underage girl.

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.041
I haven't--

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.916
Look at it yourself.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.166
Go!

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:37.000
Bastards, am I unlucky?

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:40.791
It's called falling from grace.

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.916
You're not slowing down?

00:14:57.041 --> 00:14:58.208
Hey, Sing.

00:14:58.375 --> 00:14:59.416
Tat?

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:03.500
Wow, you're in a good mood. Having a BBQ?

00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.250
-Of course.
-Give me a sausage.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:06.500
There's more over there.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.250
Hey, are you getting used to the uniform?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.583
It's good. It's bright and colorful.
I like it.

00:15:12.708 --> 00:15:13.541
-Really?
-Yes.

00:15:13.625 --> 00:15:15.250
Then wear it longer.

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:18.250
Gosh, you don't know
how to make Madam happy.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:19.708
She's lucky that I didn't beat her up.

00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:22.333
I'm not shameless like you,
I don't pursue old women.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:24.750
Hey, I didn't pursue her.

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:27.583
She's the one who keeps following me.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.333
I'll date her for sure.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.416
Look at your ugly face.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.125
I wonder what she likes about you.

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:37.875
-She likes that about me.
-What?

00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.333
Look at you,
you're the number one shooter in the SDU.

00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:42.666
Sir, the car's gone.

00:15:42.916 --> 00:15:44.625
I have to go. I'm following a big case.

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:45.833
What case?

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.166
Hey!

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:49.708
A big case?

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:06.916
Is there anybody from Team 2?

00:17:23.666 --> 00:17:25.000
They have IDs.

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:28.458
Is the Urban Council
trying to clear their garbage?

00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:30.000
Check it out.

00:17:43.291 --> 00:17:45.583
-Don't shoot, I'm a police officer too.
-Okay.

00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:47.083
We've got an undercover cop up there.

00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.375
Let me go.

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:00.958
Everybody's safe.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.166
He's our undercover cop.

00:18:05.708 --> 00:18:08.875
He's investigating a terrorist case
at an international school.

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:12.625
Those terrorists have already blown up
two schools in Britain.

00:18:12.916 --> 00:18:15.375
We're still investigating
which school is their target

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:16.875
in Hong Kong this time.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:19.791
Lydia, your turn.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.375
The Special Branch didn't inform us
that there would be an undercover cop.

00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.541
Does the Special Branch
need to tell you what we do?

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:32.250
Pete, don't get mad.
Both departments didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.500
Kid, what's your name?

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.875
Traffic Unit, PC Number 167,
Chow Sing-sing, sir.

00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:42.500
Do you have any backers?

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:44.833
Backers? No.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.750
Then show loyalty
and be the scapegoat for the case.

00:18:48.833 --> 00:18:49.791
Okay?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.416
This won't do, I didn't do anything.

00:18:55.541 --> 00:18:56.541
Yes, it's embarrassing.

00:18:56.708 --> 00:18:58.916
-It's fine, I'll just beat him up.
-He deserves it.

00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:00.625
-You think so too?
-Yes.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.125
I'll go beat him up now.

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.708
Hey, be gentle. Don't kill him.

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:07.166
-It's hard to say, I can't control myself.
-Don't use so much force.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.875
-My punches are forceful.
-You're right.

00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.541
Who can take my punch in this world?

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:12.666
-I think there's none.
-Okay, I'll beat him up then.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.208
Hey, don't hurt my Madam.

00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:15.500
I'll beat up whoever wrongs me.

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:16.541
-Yes.
-Am I right?

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.875
Yes. Then hurry back for coffee afterward.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.791
-Do you want to go for coffee?
-Yes.

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:22.083
Then let's go for coffee first.

00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:26.041
Let me tell you. I, chow Sing-sing,
am not afraid of anyone!

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.875
Whoever wrongs me, I'll beat him up!

00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.916
Have a cup of tea, ma'am.

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.458
Good boy.

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:48.458
Mom, don't force him. Okay?

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:52.000
I'm forcing him? When did I force him?

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:55.833
Tell me, am I forcing you?

00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.291
Tell me.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:00.166
Theoretically, no.

00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:02.708
Your mom wouldn't force him.

00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:03.916
-Hey.
-Yes?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.791
I'm chatting with him.
Don't interrupt, okay?

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:08.333
Oh, yes.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.750
Be honest, have you thought
about getting married?

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:21.666
Under normal and logical
moral ideologies, yes.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:23.083
What does that mean?

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.125
It means no.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.375
Why? Because I've got no money.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.250
No money? No way.

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:32.458
You've got no money
after working as a cop for so long?

00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:35.666
You're kidding, right?
You're lying to me, aren't you?

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.958
For weddings, the dress,
dowry, vouchers, sweets,

00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:41.916
banquet, honeymoon, new house,
and other things...

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.791
I couldn't afford any of them.

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:46.666
I heard that policemen's salary
is five hundred million dollars.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.375
That was a long time ago.

00:20:48.541 --> 00:20:49.625
It's none of your business.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:55.250
Five hundred million? Yes, I have it.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.250
But I've spent it all on those.

00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:02.375
No way. These are worth
five hundred million?

00:21:02.916 --> 00:21:04.125
Yes, they are.

00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.166
They're only made from paper.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.291
Yes.

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:10.250
Right now, you just cost me
hundred and fifty million.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.166
It's that expensive?

00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:15.166
Hey, you've got money.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.458
Where?

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:18.750
We opened this account together.

00:21:18.875 --> 00:21:20.916
I remember, each of us
contributed ten dollars.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.333
It has more than ten dollars now.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.083
100,000 dollars? You've saved that much?

00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:29.291
Hey, you've contributed too.
Don't you remember?

00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:32.916
I can't help it, my daughter is like me.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.000
-You're lucky, get ready for the wedding.
-Hey.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.125
Mom, don't worry. He'll do it.

00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:43.708
Okay.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:57.875
Hey, Sing.

00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:00.000
There's an important matter
that needs your help.

00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:02.791
The Special Branch and Regional Crime Unit
are cooperating for the first time.

00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:04.708
I'll be exposed this time.

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:06.500
-You're going to be a gigolo?
-No.

00:22:06.583 --> 00:22:08.416
-Then why will you be exposed?
-Well.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.833
No, I mean I'll get exposure.
I'll be visible...

00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.125
How should I say it?

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.083
You'll be outstanding.

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:14.125
Yes. Outstanding.

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.458
-That's what I've just said.
-Yes.

00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:16.541
-Right?
-And then?

00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:19.916
Well, I know all these English words,
but I don't understand them.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.083
Explain them to me.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.916
Here, it says...

00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:28.416
-What?
-What is it?

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.875
-No way.
-What is it?

00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:31.291
-What?
-What's the matter?

00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:33.458
Madam, please think twice.

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:36.250
I believe that aside from me,

00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:38.000
you shouldn't find
anyone else for this case.

00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:41.916
Tso Tat-wah is the best
in the Regional Crime Unit.

00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.083
He'll surely be able to do this.

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:46.291
Say it yourself, can you do this?

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.625
Well, let me tell you,
those terrorists are crazy.

00:22:48.708 --> 00:22:49.750
Stop pretending, say it.

00:22:49.833 --> 00:22:51.958
I know. The report is very detailed.

00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:53.958
This case is very dangerous,

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:56.958
but I've never been afraid of danger.

00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:01.208
Don't overestimate yourself.

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:06.333
Your superior is complaining that
you're not suitable for traffic duties.

00:23:06.541 --> 00:23:09.791
I'm considering transferring you
to Tung Lung Island.

00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:11.375
That's a deserted island.

00:23:11.583 --> 00:23:13.500
Yes, there are no roads.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.875
Wow, then you'll have an easy job.
Congratulations.

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.916
Can the low-ranking policeman
please leave?

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.416
We're having a meeting.

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:28.666
Sorry, I'm not a low-ranking policeman.

00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:30.833
Actually, I'm not part
of the police force anymore.

00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:33.958
I resign.

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.625
The river flows to the east
during springtime.

00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:41.708
The younger generation
has no manners nowadays.

00:23:42.666 --> 00:23:46.416
Tat, the Regional Crime Unit
is lucky to have you.

00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:50.458
Lower your voice.
Others might get jealous.

00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:04.625
Sing. Hey, I've found several jobs
that's suitable for you.

00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:05.875
Listen.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.833
An electronics factory is looking for
an experienced injection molding operator.

00:24:09.916 --> 00:24:13.333
It has a high salary, good benefits,
and transportation is provided.

00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:15.416
Not suitable?

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.250
This one.

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:21.166
Tung Wah Group of Hospitals is looking
for a guard. It has nice uniforms.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.625
That suits you. You like uniforms so much.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.291
Not suitable?

00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:28.875
Hey, this one suits you.

00:24:28.958 --> 00:24:31.166
A movie company
is looking for a male lead actor.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.166
No bad habits, young and strong,

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.708
agile and has an imposing presence.

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:39.291
Hey, you fit all their requirements.

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.875
-Do I?
-Yes.

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:43.791
But there's a minor requirement
that doesn't fit.

00:24:43.875 --> 00:24:44.833
What is it?

00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:48.416
They're looking for a male dog to do
another version of the movie Ghost.

00:24:50.291 --> 00:24:52.458
Just a minor thing.
It doesn't hurt to try.

00:24:56.166 --> 00:24:58.583
You're not thinking that
you're worse than a dog, right?

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:00.916
It's not that bad.

00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:03.958
Sing, you've got to have a plan.

00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:06.166
You're still young.
Are you thinking of being a bum?

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.666
No matter what, I've already decided.

00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.833
What is it? If you're going into business,
count me in.

00:25:09.916 --> 00:25:10.958
To do what I do best.

00:25:11.083 --> 00:25:13.291
That's right, the role of a dog
is suitable for you.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.208
Going undercover.

00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.166
I want to go back to school
to work undercover.

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.125
I want to go back to school
to work undercover.

00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:31.833
I need a few assistants
to act as the students.

00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:37.291
They have to be strong, agile,
smart, and courageous.

00:25:37.916 --> 00:25:39.333
That's why I need you guys.

00:25:40.541 --> 00:25:41.583
-No way.
-No way.

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.041
You're obviously trying to trick us.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.041
How do you know?

00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.166
We're so lousy.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.375
How are we strong, agile,
smart, and courageous?

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.458
-Don't think that we're that stupid.
-That's right.

00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:52.125
We're lousy, but we're not that bad.

00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:53.541
Don't think you can fool us so easily.

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:55.000
-No way.
-No way.

00:25:55.083 --> 00:25:56.250
-No.
-Even if you're our leader.

00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:57.625
How much money do you want? Say it.

00:25:57.708 --> 00:25:58.791
-15,000.
-15,000.

00:25:58.875 --> 00:25:59.875
15,000 each.

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:00.916
On a monthly basis.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.708
Hong Kong dollars, not yen.

00:26:03.666 --> 00:26:04.666
Deal.

00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:05.958
-Thanks, boss.
-Thanks, boss.

00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:06.916
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.458
-Let's go together.
-Let's eat.

00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:10.833
-I don't get why we have to do this.
-That's right.

00:26:10.916 --> 00:26:15.291
Because I want everyone to know
that I'm number one in the SDU.

00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:19.500
In the lost pistol case last time, I was
very courageous in the face of danger.

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:22.541
I should've been Chief Superintendent
or Chief Inspector.

00:26:22.708 --> 00:26:25.333
I definitely shouldn't be PC Number 167
in the Traffic Unit.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.541
-Do you understand?
-I do.

00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:29.000
You're lying!

00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:32.208
You're so dense, how would you understand?

00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:37.166
Sing, I'm dense, but I'm very smart!

00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:43.041
Within one week,
which is before midnight of Christmas Eve,

00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:45.958
if the British Government doesn't release
the head of the terrorists,

00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:49.916
they'll create trouble
in one of the schools in Hong Kong.

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:52.458
Sing, why does the British Government's
business concern Hong Kong?

00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:53.416
-Right.
-Right.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.375
-Is it a holiday on the Queen's birthday?
-Yes.

00:26:55.458 --> 00:26:57.083
-Then it's our business.
-That's right.

00:26:57.166 --> 00:27:00.125
But there are so many schools
in Hong Kong. Which one do we go to?

00:27:00.583 --> 00:27:01.750
I've done an analysis already.

00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:06.916
The undercover cop who just died
was in the Adam Smith International.

00:27:07.708 --> 00:27:09.458
Those currently studying in this school

00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:12.500
are the children of ambassadors
and big businessmen.

00:27:12.666 --> 00:27:15.583
If I were the terrorists,
I'll cause trouble there.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.958
But what if you're wrong?

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:18.583
Then I'll beat you up.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.833
Can we rely on this?

00:27:19.916 --> 00:27:21.875
It's as reliable as 999 pure gold.

00:27:22.458 --> 00:27:24.250
You guys get ready, I'll enroll us.

00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:28.416
Sing, don't guess wrong.

00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:34.000
Excuse me, is Principal Kam here?

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:35.416
You mean Mr. Kim, the manager?

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.708
He's a principal, not a manager.

00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:39.000
It's the same. It's the first door
when you turn left up ahead.

00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:43.041
Are you Principal Kam?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.416
Come in.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.500
I have a guest. I'll talk to you later.

00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:50.250
What can I do for you?

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:51.541
I want to enroll.

00:27:51.833 --> 00:27:52.791
Which one?

00:27:52.875 --> 00:27:55.041
Adam Smith International.

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:57.791
Which grade?

00:27:57.875 --> 00:27:59.625
Grade 12, there are four of us.

00:28:00.083 --> 00:28:02.125
There are slots available.
I'll process the paperwork.

00:28:03.375 --> 00:28:05.750
Chow Sing-sing, how old are you?

00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:07.375
18 years old.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.625
Are you serious?
You look like at least 28.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:11.666
Are you serious?

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:13.291
It doesn't matter.

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:16.958
Regardless of your age,
don't feel inferior.

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:19.791
As long as you're willing to learn,
we'll teach you.

00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.166
That's good.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:25.625
The tuition fee is 4,000 dollars each,
16,000 dollars for 4 people.

00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.833
And the book fee is 3,600 dollars each.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.750
The sports uniform fee
is 2,800 dollars each.

00:28:31.833 --> 00:28:34.541
The total is 41,600 dollars.

00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:36.041
Sir, thank you.

00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:22.500
Hey.

00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:23.916
Hey.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.000
What are you doing here?

00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:30.625
Studying.

00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.666
Where's the Student Affairs office?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.208
Are you kidding me?

00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:36.791
Thanks. Say thank you.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.416
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:29:47.541 --> 00:29:49.583
I wonder if the Director of
Student Affairs is nice or not.

00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:51.791
Can he be worse than Mr. Lam from before?

00:29:51.875 --> 00:29:54.958
You idiots, we paid to come here.
Am I right, Sing?

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:18.041
-It's Uncle Tat!
-No!

00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:23.583
If you're James Bond, then I'm Batman.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.458
Listen, I'm your Director
of Student Affairs, James Bond!

00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:30.458
Not Batman, or Superman.
And also not Uncle Tat.

00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:32.958
Come. Hit me if you dare.

00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:35.458
Those guys from the Special Branch
are watching us outside.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.958
I don't care, I came here to study.

00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:40.916
The Director of Student Affairs
hits us for no reason?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.916
Not "us".

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.458
The order is to just hit you.

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:46.333
Come on, let me hit you
and finish the job.

00:30:46.416 --> 00:30:47.916
I'll treat you to supper later.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.083
You think I'm stupid?
How can I eat after you hit me?

00:30:50.166 --> 00:30:52.500
Don't worry, I'll be gentle.

00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:54.750
If it hurts, you can fight back.

00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:55.666
-Okay.
-Come on.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.708
There's no need for supper,
just give me 1,000 dollars.

00:30:57.791 --> 00:30:59.083
-500 dollars.
-800 dollars.

00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:00.041
Deal!

00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:07.916
Wow, are they enemies?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.833
Hey, you're getting 800 dollars from me.

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:11.583
Can you treat me to dinner?

00:31:11.708 --> 00:31:13.125
I'll give you a banana.

00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:15.000
Why are you such a miser?

00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:18.291
Hey, it's so dull to go
just left and right.

00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:19.500
I'm so tired.

00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:21.166
I'm hitting you.
I'm not tired, but you are?

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.833
My neck is tired
from turning side to side.

00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:25.666
Any other styles?

00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:26.666
Yes.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.083
Why is there a cane here?

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.166
Sing, are you all right?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.833
-I'm fine.
-What should we do now?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.833
Look for a chance to beat up that bastard.

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:43.041
No, I mean what's the next step?

00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:47.916
All right, we need to get access
to information in this school.

00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:50.916
I want to know everything Mike did
in this school before.

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:53.041
I see. We'll get going then.

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:54.458
Where are you going?

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.750
That way.

00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:56.875
For what?

00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:58.208
That's none of your business.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.541
What kind of attitude is that?

00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:03.625
Sing, where are we going?

00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:05.875
-Anywhere, over there.
-Okay.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.333
Still fooling around, kid?

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:11.333
Are you finished?

00:32:11.583 --> 00:32:13.458
Almost, Sing. Be patient.

00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:14.625
Hurry up.

00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:22.458
Sorry, man.

00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:25.083
I'm a girl.

00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:26.958
I wouldn't know if you didn't tell me.

00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:28.250
Now you know.

00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:29.666
You don't seem like one.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.583
Apologize.

00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:44.333
Apologize.

00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:46.416
Apologize.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.833
Apologize.

00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:50.458
I'm sorry, miss.

00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:57.041
Are we done here?

00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:58.333
-Sing...
-Let's go.

00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:05.208
Sing, it's almost dark.
We haven't found our room yet.

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:06.583
Ask someone.

00:33:10.291 --> 00:33:11.958
This one must be a girl.

00:33:12.125 --> 00:33:13.833
Hey, girl. Where's the classroom?

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:18.041
Sweetie, would you
tell me where Room 507 is?

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.458
It's downstairs.

00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:25.791
This novel, Tides isn't suitable for you.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.791
The male and female leads met
and encountered huge tides.

00:33:28.875 --> 00:33:31.166
Unfortunately, they died
and everything ended in tragedy.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.250
It's too sad.

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:33.833
You should read something less sad.

00:33:33.916 --> 00:33:35.041
Something less sad?

00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:38.291
Yes, such as Yik Shu's Spring Dream.

00:33:38.375 --> 00:33:39.875
Tsukasa Hojo's City Hunter.

00:33:39.958 --> 00:33:41.416
Akira Toriyama's Doctor IQ.

00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:44.166
Oh, Wong Yuk-long's Oriental Heroes.

00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:46.208
I think that's the most suitable for you.

00:33:48.208 --> 00:33:51.083
Sing, I didn't know that you have
such a deep foundation in literature.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.500
You're a man of sense.

00:33:52.625 --> 00:33:54.208
I don't get why people say
you're senseless.

00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.208
I know, right?

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.125
-It's not fair.
-It's unreasonable.

00:33:57.208 --> 00:33:59.916
Sing, I've got a new recruit.

00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:02.291
-You?
-Yes, I was surprised too.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.375
-He's our leader.
-Leader.

00:34:05.666 --> 00:34:07.875
-How much do you want, Leader?
-What are you talking about?

00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:09.500
Every leader asks for money.

00:34:10.083 --> 00:34:11.125
What does he mean?

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.000
Albert joined all the clubs in school.

00:34:14.083 --> 00:34:17.625
Yes, from school clubs to triads
and he pays all the fees.

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:22.083
-Is there a triad here?
-Yes.

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:24.041
That guy belongs to Gang B.

00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:27.041
He's dark-skinned, but that doesn't mean
he's part of a triad.

00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:28.583
Black people have triads too.

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.958
That guy belongs to Gang C.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.291
C?

00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:35.166
C for supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

00:34:37.125 --> 00:34:39.916
Actually, I just want
to ask you about someone.

00:34:40.083 --> 00:34:41.000
Follow me.

00:34:41.583 --> 00:34:43.708
-Pay up.
-Pay up.

00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:45.333
Thirty dollars?

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.375
Give a discount, we're friends.

00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.458
Fine.

00:34:48.541 --> 00:34:49.625
-Never mind.
-Don't forget.

00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:51.041
-Fanshu.
-Yes.

00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:52.708
Did you get it done?

00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:54.500
I've already found some informers, Sing.

00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:55.833
There's absolutely no problem.

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:02.333
Over there. I have already
paid for those seats.

00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:14.166
It's that girl from earlier.

00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:16.625
Sweetie.

00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:34.833
They're so disorderly.

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:36.875
Isn't that good? We can do anything.

00:35:36.958 --> 00:35:38.625
Do we need to be restrained
like we're in jail?

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.791
-It's really number two.
-What is?

00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:42.958
Number two in the fifth race.
Hey, the sixth race will soon begin.

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:44.625
Ten percent discount
for outside betting. Interested?

00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:46.458
No? Stocks, gold, options,
currencies then?

00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:48.416
Hey, the yen's currency is appreciating.
Interested?

00:35:48.708 --> 00:35:50.500
No? Women from China, USA, France, Russia?

00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:52.125
Eighteen years old,
you can go all the way.

00:35:52.208 --> 00:35:55.625
No? Men? Animals? Dogs?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Mice?

00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:18.958
Sir, that book is for you.
What do you think?

00:36:19.583 --> 00:36:20.708
It's good.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.583
Read it carefully, it's really good.

00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:27.875
I don't really like balls.

00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:32.958
Why don't we take attendance first?

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.958
Sandy Lai.

00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:57.000
-Sandy.
-Hey.

00:36:58.333 --> 00:36:59.375
Present.

00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:04.958
And this one is a new student.

00:37:05.125 --> 00:37:07.416
Stephen Chow.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:08.750
-Present.
-Present.

00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:10.541
It's Chow.

00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:11.916
Present.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.708
Mr. Chow, welcome to the class.

00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:16.541
Matthew, chapter 27.

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:21.000
At this time, when Judas,
the betrayer of Jesus,

00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:26.416
saw that Jesus had been convicted,
he was filled with regret.

00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:37.750
-Play Mahjong.
-Good, how much are we betting?

00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:40.000
What are you doing?

00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:41.458
Goodbye, sir. Let's play mahjong.

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:47.000
Your punishment is to copy
the Old and New Testament.

00:37:48.208 --> 00:37:50.458
What? Why is he so serious?

00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.291
Didn't you want to play mahjong?

00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:55.791
Maybe a few years later.
The Bible is so thick.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.750
Don't think about playing mahjong
for two years.

00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:59.291
You won't even have time to masturbate.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.666
How can I survive?

00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.791
Going back to the regretful Judas.

00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:07.875
He placed those 30 pieces of silver
in the church.

00:38:08.708 --> 00:38:10.916
Then left and hung himself.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.500
What depressed him so much
to end his life?

00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:19.666
Do you think that Judas
who betrayed Jesus is a good man?

00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:23.750
Judas? He's okay.

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:27.166
If he did not betray Jesus,
then he would not be nailed to the cross.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.833
If that didn't happen, then you wouldn't
have a cross on your neck.

00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:33.083
You'd be unemployed. Are you scared?

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.541
Judas' betrayal was God's plan.

00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:39.833
Yes. That means God purposely
tricked Judas.

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:46.333
God, please forgive me for being violent.

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:49.541
Please show me how to save this student.

00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:55.500
Sing, there's no order here.

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:56.708
Do it if you want to.

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:01.833
Why? Do you want to copy the Bible?

00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:02.833
That's not a big deal.

00:39:02.916 --> 00:39:04.833
We can talk about
God saving my soul later.

00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:07.000
Right now, I want to hit you.

00:39:11.708 --> 00:39:14.208
Sing, you're great. Your punch is good.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.583
But I sense something bad is coming.

00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:35.083
Gosh, you could have insulted anyone,
but not Minister Wong.

00:39:35.166 --> 00:39:37.916
He's the most powerful person in school,
even more than me and the Principal.

00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:40.083
He can kick you out anytime
if you offend him.

00:39:40.166 --> 00:39:41.416
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:39:41.833 --> 00:39:43.250
I forgot.

00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:46.458
Go!

00:39:47.958 --> 00:39:50.500
Let's see how you can hit me now.

00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:52.041
Go!

00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:54.250
You're something, Mr. Tso.

00:39:54.375 --> 00:39:56.291
Of course! Don't run!

00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.083
Mr. Tso.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:01.666
What's the matter?

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.833
I want to ask you something
in the washroom.

00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:07.666
-Do we need to go to the washroom?
-It would only take you a second.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.125
-Just ask me here, okay?
-The washroom is better.

00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:12.083
Don't run away, Mr. Tso!

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.583
Hey, it's a school regulation.
I didn't want to hit you.

00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:23.125
You're so silly, when have I ever
kept the score with you?

00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:26.375
I just beat you until you bled, right?
That means I'm not angry at all.

00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:29.958
Yes. It's very kind of you
not to kill me. Thanks a lot.

00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.083
I care about you.
It's worth buying me dim sum, right?

00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:35.000
Yes.

00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:36.791
Afterward, can you bring me

00:40:36.875 --> 00:40:40.375
-some glutinous chicken and shumai too?
-Yes.

00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:43.541
That guy is weird, what is he doing here?

00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:45.583
Don't mind him.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.416
It's fine as long as
he doesn't stand in our way.

00:40:49.041 --> 00:40:51.041
Most importantly,
don't let him get close to Sandy.

00:41:01.291 --> 00:41:03.375
Sir, I really won't do it next time.

00:41:03.458 --> 00:41:06.458
You fool, let's see if you dare
to do it again next time.

00:41:06.541 --> 00:41:09.791
Yes, but can you be gentle next time?

00:41:09.875 --> 00:41:11.375
You won't be scared if I'm gentle.

00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:13.041
-You're right.
-Go back to the classroom.

00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:54.125
Is Sandy really involved in the case?

00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:56.958
Sing, you were spectacular earlier.

00:42:57.041 --> 00:42:58.250
You punched through the ball.

00:42:58.333 --> 00:43:00.125
It was really amazing
and we are all in awe.

00:43:00.208 --> 00:43:01.750
-Do I deserve a prize?
-Yes.

00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:04.041
-The top prize.
-Did any pretty girls scream?

00:43:04.125 --> 00:43:05.666
Not only that, some even moaned.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.000
-Who?
-Look.

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:11.458
Sing, remember you can
only catch the eraser before.

00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:14.208
Now, you've already attained the level
of punching through the ball

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:17.416
and you also looked so cool doing it.
You're amazing.

00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:20.125
-I can not only catch the eraser now.
-What else can you catch?

00:43:20.208 --> 00:43:23.291
-I can even catch bullets.
-Wow, you've got to show us that.

00:43:23.375 --> 00:43:24.958
There will be a chance. Just be patient.

00:43:25.041 --> 00:43:26.666
Then I'll wait for it. Okay?

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.750
So the Special Branch has already
set up their people here.

00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:31.166
That proves I'm right.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.541
There's surely something
going on in this school.

00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:36.291
Great. I don't have to get beaten up.

00:43:36.708 --> 00:43:38.375
What are you doing?
Do you have any information?

00:43:38.458 --> 00:43:39.708
I want to take my girlfriend out.

00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:40.666
-Yes.
-Me too.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.083
What? Is it time to go now?

00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:43.583
Go home and do your homework.

00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:46.625
Chow Sing-sing, the Special Branch
wants to invite you for coffee.

00:43:46.916 --> 00:43:49.833
Leader. You're going for coffee?
I want to come too.

00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:52.333
What were you doing at school?

00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:54.166
Do you have amnesia?

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.416
I told you many times,
we're there to study, man.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.625
Call me sir.

00:43:57.791 --> 00:43:58.916
Are you a teacher?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.541
Which subject are you teaching?

00:44:00.625 --> 00:44:04.791
Based on your looks, you must teach Shit.
No, I mean Chinese History.

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:07.958
I'm warning you guys.
Don't follow him to school again.

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:09.291
Otherwise, I'll arrest you.

00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:10.875
What's the matter?

00:44:10.958 --> 00:44:13.541
What can I do except study? I'm a student.

00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:17.166
Yes, you can't stop people from studying.

00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:19.333
Chow Sing-sing isn't part
of the police force anymore.

00:44:19.416 --> 00:44:20.416
Isn't that right, Tat?

00:44:20.708 --> 00:44:23.166
Are you scared of him?

00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:25.083
I'm not scared of him at all!

00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:27.333
Listen carefully. Focus on your studies.

00:44:27.416 --> 00:44:29.375
Don't investigate the case,
don't flirt with girls,

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:31.000
don't beat
the Director of Student Affairs.

00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:34.041
Get out.

00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:44.833
That's enough. You're dismissed.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.500
If anything goes wrong in this case,
you're responsible.

00:44:59.083 --> 00:45:00.583
Did you arrange that?

00:45:01.666 --> 00:45:04.583
Can you not ask what I'm up to?

00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:08.041
Yes, I trust you.

00:45:08.708 --> 00:45:10.125
Is your face all right?

00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:12.041
You're so nosy.

00:45:26.708 --> 00:45:27.833
Hey, why doesn't it work?

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:30.375
Never mind, our source said
they're inside. Let's move in.

00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:31.375
Okay.

00:45:39.458 --> 00:45:42.125
-How come no one's here?
-Be careful, they must be here.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.333
Not me.

00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:15.208
Sing, this guy knows our identity.

00:46:15.375 --> 00:46:16.833
We're in danger.

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:19.125
How about...

00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:21.125
Please don't kill me.

00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:24.416
If our secret spreads out...

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.500
How come? I've already joined your club.

00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:34.708
Finish the homework
if you want to get out of trouble.

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:35.791
It's done.

00:46:36.833 --> 00:46:38.916
Sing, where's your Hi-Fi?

00:46:39.625 --> 00:46:40.541
I sold it.

00:46:40.625 --> 00:46:41.708
You're getting an upgrade?

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:46.416
I have no money, you guys already
spent my 100,000 dollars in two days.

00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:47.750
I had to sell it.

00:46:52.083 --> 00:46:53.625
Sing, don't worry.

00:46:53.708 --> 00:46:55.458
I'll introduce you to a loan shark.

00:46:56.208 --> 00:46:57.291
Who?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.541
Sing, it's six o'clock, I'll charge you
overtime if we're not dismissed.

00:47:03.708 --> 00:47:05.416
Dismiss.

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:11.375
-Ms. Ho? Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

00:47:11.458 --> 00:47:13.625
-We'll talk to you later. We're off work.
-Off work?

00:47:13.708 --> 00:47:14.916
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:18.041
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:47:19.625 --> 00:47:20.541
Man.

00:47:21.208 --> 00:47:23.208
Hey, they said they're off work.

00:47:23.291 --> 00:47:24.833
Yes, they came to fix the plumbing.

00:47:24.916 --> 00:47:25.833
Plumbing?

00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:28.166
They're learning to be plumbers.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
-My hair has gotten long again.
-No problem, sit down.

00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:34.041
-Thank you.
-Miss, how many people?

00:47:34.208 --> 00:47:35.250
One.

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:37.916
Have you reserved the wedding banquet?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.958
Yes.

00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:43.583
Where's the Hi-Fi?

00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:46.125
There's no need for the Hi-Fi, is there?

00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:50.541
I've got you. I don't need it anymore.

00:47:50.958 --> 00:47:52.250
What are you talking about?

00:47:52.333 --> 00:47:54.375
That means your singing
is better than a Hi-Fi.

00:47:55.625 --> 00:47:58.083
I made an appointment
with a realtor tomorrow.

00:47:58.166 --> 00:47:59.750
Remember to bring the checkbook, okay?

00:48:00.583 --> 00:48:02.708
You want to make a deposit?
We're not in a rush, right?

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.416
Why? Don't you have money?

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.416
I do, I still have
whatever you gave me last time.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.708
But if you make a deposit,
you have to pay the mortgage right away.

00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.416
That's fine, you can apply
for civil service allowance.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.000
Who says I have that?

00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:18.708
Why don't you have it?

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.916
I'm an undercover cop.

00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:23.750
Undercover cop? Weren't you promoted?

00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:26.041
Yes, I was, but I'm still
an undercover cop.

00:48:26.666 --> 00:48:29.250
I'm now the commander of undercover cops.

00:48:30.208 --> 00:48:31.666
Not anyone can take this post.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.125
You should be happy for me. Are you?

00:48:34.875 --> 00:48:36.000
-Yes.
-Smile then.

00:48:37.375 --> 00:48:39.666
Hey, will that delay our wedding?

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:42.458
No, it better not.

00:48:42.958 --> 00:48:44.750
Otherwise, how will I survive?

00:48:46.125 --> 00:48:47.125
What did you do?

00:48:48.708 --> 00:48:49.708
Nothing.

00:48:50.083 --> 00:48:51.166
Keep going.

00:48:51.333 --> 00:48:53.250
-More?
-Yes.

00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:54.416
You asked for it.

00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:56.250
Hurry.

00:48:57.875 --> 00:49:00.625
Today, I'll teach you judo.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:09.958
To be good at judo,
the waist is the most important.

00:49:10.291 --> 00:49:11.208
Come on.

00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:19.083
Aside from that,
the feet are important too.

00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:20.333
Come on.

00:49:23.125 --> 00:49:24.500
Did you see that?

00:49:24.875 --> 00:49:28.916
Actually, judo is very dynamic.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.583
-Sandy, come and spar with him.
-Yes.

00:49:40.666 --> 00:49:42.666
Sir, she's a girl.

00:49:42.833 --> 00:49:45.458
I purposely pick the most petite one
to spar with you.

00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:47.541
I'm afraid the others might kill you.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.541
Ready. Fight!

00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:24.750
Why are you dancing cha-cha? Fight!

00:50:49.458 --> 00:50:50.541
Sorry about that.

00:50:58.458 --> 00:50:59.916
All right, let's call that a draw.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.458
Hey, you're done with the shower?

00:51:07.333 --> 00:51:08.333
Do you practice judo?

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500
No.

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:10.750
Why are you taking a shower?

00:51:12.333 --> 00:51:13.791
We're partners.

00:51:29.208 --> 00:51:32.375
Sandy isn't related to this case.

00:51:32.958 --> 00:51:34.000
Sandy?

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.666
I don't understand, I'm just a student.

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.333
Then you shouldn't flirt with girls.

00:51:40.625 --> 00:51:41.625
I'm not.

00:51:41.708 --> 00:51:43.166
Is she the one flirting with you then?

00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:44.875
Look at your face.

00:51:44.958 --> 00:51:46.833
Side view, top of your head.

00:51:46.916 --> 00:51:50.916
Which part will the girls love? Tell me.

00:51:52.083 --> 00:51:54.000
-None.
-That's right.

00:51:59.291 --> 00:52:01.041
If there's any girl, it's only Sandy.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.000
Hey, why are you kissing?

00:52:14.625 --> 00:52:16.125
Why didn't you invite me along?

00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:21.416
Next time...

00:52:23.125 --> 00:52:24.291
Stay away from her.

00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:30.125
Do you have hair conditioner?
Give it to me.

00:52:32.958 --> 00:52:35.166
Don't say thank you, thanks is okay.

00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:37.208
Thanks.

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:38.666
Leader.

00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:50.166
-Do you know that girl with short hair?
-Which one?

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:53.875
The one with the comic book
who is obviously wild based on her looks.

00:52:54.583 --> 00:52:57.083
That's Jacky, Sandy's elder sister.

00:52:57.791 --> 00:52:59.333
Everyone's afraid of her.

00:52:59.875 --> 00:53:03.125
-Why? Do you have a plan?
-Yes.

00:53:03.666 --> 00:53:06.000
Your mission is to divert the girl

00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:08.833
reading the comic book
who is obviously wild based on her looks.

00:53:09.208 --> 00:53:11.666
What? That one? No way.

00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:13.416
What about the one next to her?

00:53:13.583 --> 00:53:16.625
I'll take care of her,
you take care of the wild one.

00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:38.583
Miss, do you have boobs?

00:53:39.333 --> 00:53:40.916
What are you talking about?

00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:42.500
Just a little is enough.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.500
So what if my boobs are small?

00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:47.875
-I mean time.
-No!

00:53:52.125 --> 00:53:53.041
Hey!

00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:57.083
You bastard, you want to get away?

00:53:57.291 --> 00:53:58.625
Don't let me catch you.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.500
Jacky.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.708
Hey, what a coincidence.

00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:34.833
-Yes, what a coincidence.
-That's right.

00:54:35.708 --> 00:54:36.833
What are you doing here?

00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:38.875
Getting a suntan.

00:54:44.708 --> 00:54:45.625
Okay.

00:54:48.708 --> 00:54:49.625
Let's go.

00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:55.291
It seems like we've known
each other for a long time.

00:54:55.375 --> 00:54:56.916
Yes, I have the same feeling.

00:54:58.583 --> 00:55:01.750
To tell you the truth, I really like you.

00:55:03.416 --> 00:55:04.333
I know.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:08.708
To tell you the truth,
I'm not near-sighted.

00:55:09.708 --> 00:55:10.833
It's getting in the way.

00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:24.916
Going back to the conversation...

00:55:27.416 --> 00:55:28.458
What was I saying?

00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:31.375
-Going back to the conversation...
-Yes.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.833
Do you remember a guy named Mike Chan?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.208
Do you know Mike Chan?

00:55:39.833 --> 00:55:41.166
-No.
-What?

00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:43.625
-I don't know him.
-Mike Chan?

00:55:43.708 --> 00:55:44.666
I don't know him.

00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:48.541
Mike Chan.

00:55:49.125 --> 00:55:51.625
There's Mike Chu and I know Peter Chan,

00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:53.541
but not Mike Chan.

00:55:54.416 --> 00:55:58.041
Are you kidding? Have you forgotten?
Please think carefully.

00:55:58.125 --> 00:55:59.500
It's very important to me.

00:55:59.958 --> 00:56:01.541
I think my sister may know.

00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:02.583
Let's go and find her.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.791
Let's see how long you can hold it.

00:56:47.708 --> 00:56:48.791
Want to play? Come on.

00:56:48.875 --> 00:56:50.083
No, thank you.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.583
Get up.

00:56:52.166 --> 00:56:53.666
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:56.708
Jacky, do you know a guy called Mike Chan?

00:56:57.458 --> 00:56:59.166
-Mike Chan?
-Tell him.

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.458
Which Mike Chan?

00:57:00.541 --> 00:57:01.458
This Mike Chan.

00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:05.416
Oh, it's Slacker Chan.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:09.250
-Slacker Chan?
-Yes, it's him. He's known as that.

00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:10.541
Four days of absence in a week.

00:57:10.625 --> 00:57:12.500
Sleeping in the class.

00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:14.208
-Is that so?
-Yes.

00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:16.375
Do you know his usual activities before?

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.625
He doesn't have any.

00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:20.625
He's a slacker.

00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:22.625
Let's play ball.

00:57:24.125 --> 00:57:25.041
Gosh.

00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:27.458
Let's play ball.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.666
I have to try it this time.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.375
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:34.791
This isn't something kids should do.

00:57:34.958 --> 00:57:37.166
My sister isn't afraid,
why are you so lame?

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.625
-Yes.
-You haven't tried it before?

00:57:39.875 --> 00:57:41.333
Yes, I haven't.

00:57:41.458 --> 00:57:43.333
-Me too.
-Is that so?

00:57:43.416 --> 00:57:44.375
Let's try it.

00:57:44.458 --> 00:57:46.458
We're no longer kids after we do it.

00:57:46.708 --> 00:57:49.166
-Come on, let's try it once.
-I don't think we should.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.666
Come on, there's no one here.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:51.875
-No.
-Just once!

00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:53.416
Hurry!

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.500
-Can you take it?
-Yes.

00:57:54.583 --> 00:57:55.666
-Okay.
-Come on!

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.666
All right.

00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:00.541
-You won't regret it?
-No!

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:01.708
-Close your eyes then.
-No!

00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:02.625
-Here I come.
-Come on.

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:03.583
I'm doing it!

00:58:13.708 --> 00:58:14.750
What's the matter?

00:58:18.875 --> 00:58:20.083
You have asthma?

00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:22.041
No, I'm just breathing.

00:58:22.625 --> 00:58:23.666
Breathing?

00:58:24.333 --> 00:58:27.291
-Hey, where are my glasses?
-Glasses?

00:58:27.375 --> 00:58:29.375
-My glasses. Oh, yes.
-Your glasses.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:33.750
How do you feel?

00:58:33.958 --> 00:58:35.541
Great, you?

00:58:36.666 --> 00:58:39.291
But little girls shouldn't try this.

00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:41.416
If you want to try it again,
remember to ask me.

00:58:41.541 --> 00:58:45.583
-You're not afraid of an asthma attack?
-Yes, but for you, it's fine.

00:58:47.041 --> 00:58:48.333
-Chow Sing-sing.
-Run!

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:51.041
Hey, wait. I want to ask you something.

00:58:51.125 --> 00:58:52.791
-Oh, it's you.
-Don't be afraid.

00:58:52.875 --> 00:58:54.125
What is it?

00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:55.416
I've thought about it for so long.

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.083
I think you're the only one
who can teach me.

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.083
All right.

00:58:58.208 --> 00:58:59.291
How can I get a girlfriend?

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.625
A girlfriend? Why are you asking me?

00:59:02.041 --> 00:59:03.333
I saw you two just now...

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.625
You were very skillful.

00:59:07.375 --> 00:59:09.500
Those are only the basics. Any targets?

00:59:09.625 --> 00:59:12.958
Yes, but I don't know
why I'm such a coward.

00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:14.625
No problem, let's talk.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.875
Of course, you should have guts
in order to get a girlfriend.

00:59:16.958 --> 00:59:18.916
-Yes.
-But I think the priority now is

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.083
-to get a good hairstyle first.
-Yes.

00:59:24.625 --> 00:59:25.916
What a waste of time.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.166
It turns out those are irrelevant.

00:59:29.875 --> 00:59:31.041
Any updates, Siu-gwai?

00:59:31.125 --> 00:59:32.125
-Siu-gwai.
-What?

00:59:32.208 --> 00:59:36.083
Incredible! How can a kiss be so powerful?

00:59:36.458 --> 00:59:38.166
It must be the power of love, Sing.

00:59:39.041 --> 00:59:40.083
When will you marry her then?

00:59:40.708 --> 00:59:43.208
She said when she's
financially stable first.

00:59:46.083 --> 00:59:49.125
Fine. I must be the most
unfortunate among you then.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.958
I'm stuck with a little girl.
I don't know how to end it.

00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:56.083
Sing, you've got a girlfriend.
Can you resist her?

00:59:58.583 --> 01:00:01.750
I'll handle her for you
even if it would cost me.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.041
Okay, go ahead.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.416
You're silly, I was kidding.

01:00:05.791 --> 01:00:08.666
Look at me. With my face, how would I...

01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:11.583
It's good that you know.

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:16.291
Anyway, we're in big trouble!

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:20.166
-Leader. I've got information.
-Yes, what is it?

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.541
Mike Chan had gone out
with the two girls over there.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.583
Those two...

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:30.333
You two go and talk to them first.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.583
Sing, you always ask us
to do this kind of thing.

01:00:33.666 --> 01:00:35.916
-We feel like gigolos.
-Yes.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:38.416
-Would you do it then?
-Of course.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.000
These young men are still young indeed.

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:45.916
Look, they can't
control themselves at all.

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:48.333
How can they accomplish big things?

01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:49.708
Hey.

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:51.666
Hey.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.208
Let's go and buy a soft drink.

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:56.666
Just a soft drink?
How about having lunch together?

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:59.041
-Wow.
-They're vibrating.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.166
-Wow.
-Hey, you're cheating.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:02.666
Still playing around?

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.083
Let me ask you.

01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:05.958
Does Sing really have a girlfriend?

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.250
Yes, you have no idea how pretty she is.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:09.333
Unlike you.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.333
Yes. Tell Sandy to consider me.

01:01:12.416 --> 01:01:13.541
I'm not bad, right?

01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:15.583
My haircut is just a bit outdated.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.041
What a jerk.

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:22.708
You. Do you have another girlfriend?
Do you? Tell me.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:23.708
No.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.500
Why are your ears so red then?

01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:26.791
I don't know.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:32.125
I feel ashamed for you
for having these kinds of friends.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.500
Let me tell you.

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:35.708
Don't let me see Chow Sing-sing again.

01:01:35.791 --> 01:01:38.791
If I see him, I'll beat him up.
Do you hear me?

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.666
You really don't want to go out
with me, right?

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.958
That's not it. It depends.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.125
If you don't want to, then don't.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.958
If you do, you should let me
hold your hand,

01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:55.291
not the school bag.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.333
I told you, it depends.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:58.791
Let's get something to eat.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:03.958
What did you say earlier?

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:07.500
I'm asking you again, am I pretty?

01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:09.000
-You're pretty!
-Say it!

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:10.500
Let's go somewhere else.

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:17.833
-What's the matter?
-I want to pee.

01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:19.625
-I'll wait for you.
-Let's go together.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.750
No, not in the washroom. Let's talk here.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:25.958
-Hey, don't you want to pee?
-Oh, I want to hold it for a while.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:27.125
Can you hold it?

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:29.583
Nothing's hard in this world
if you're determined.

01:02:29.875 --> 01:02:31.125
Go and get something to eat.

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:32.916
-Okay, hold it for a while then.
-Okay.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.750
As an undercover cop,
I'm prepared for this.

01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:57.541
-How come you have a mask on?
-Let's go.

01:02:57.666 --> 01:02:59.125
No. I know these people.

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.583
Hi, sir, ma'am.

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:03.625
-What a coincidence.
-Yes, what a coincidence.

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:06.500
This is Ms. Ho. She used to be my tutor.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:11.416
Ms. Ho, since you stopped tutoring me,
my grades have been dropping.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.875
Come to my place if you have time then.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:16.041
-But I'm going to move out soon.
-Are you?

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.166
I'm getting married.

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:19.666
-You're getting married? Congratulations.
-Yes.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.791
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.666
I'm on a date.

01:03:25.416 --> 01:03:27.000
-Is he your boyfriend?
-Wow.

01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:28.708
Hello, how are you?

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.916
But he's always very naughty.

01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:34.250
He's so much fun.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.541
-Let's go.
-What?

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.416
-We haven't eaten yet.
-I'm not feeling well.

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:40.208
-Let's go.
-Excuse me, I'll go ahead.

01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:41.375
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:43.125
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:45.583
Bye. I'm safe now.

01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:47.000
-Sing!
-Who is it?

01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:48.541
-It's me.
-You've got the wrong person.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:49.541
Who says so?

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:54.500
If it wasn't for your voice,
I wouldn't have recognized you.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:03:55.708
Sit.

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:56.916
It's you?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.583
Yes. Sit.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:01.375
Let me fix the situation for you.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.375
Ms. Ho, don't be mad.

01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:05.833
The reason why Sing
is with Sandy lately is

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:07.791
because of work.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:10.958
It's hard to say if there are
personal feelings between them.

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.333
Don't interrupt me.
Don't take it too seriously.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.666
Don't take it seriously too.

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:17.125
Actually, Sing is very ambitious.

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:19.125
Even though he got fired
by the police force,

01:04:19.208 --> 01:04:20.583
he still insists on working undercover.

01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:22.791
Also, because of it,

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.458
he even spent 100,000 dollars
of your wedding money.

01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:26.625
-What?
-What a guy!

01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:27.666
He's very miserable now.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.291
Look at him. Am I right?

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.791
So, let's think of a way to help him.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.000
Let's think of something.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:35.916
Let's not get married then.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.916
Gosh!

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:40.458
Good idea, that's the solution.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:41.458
Just don't get married.

01:04:41.541 --> 01:04:45.375
You got me in big trouble now,
you damn old pig!

01:04:47.708 --> 01:04:49.250
Why did you insult me?

01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:50.958
I was helping you.

01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:55.791
Good thing the Special Branch
doesn't have someone like you in our team.

01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:57.791
Damn old pig.

01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:59.500
You're insulting me?

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:01.791
What's the matter?
Can't we call you damn old pig?

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:03.458
-Say that again.
-Damn old--

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.083
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:08.500
-Why did you hit him?
-He insulted me.

01:05:08.708 --> 01:05:10.333
I did too, why didn't you hit me?

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:12.500
I'm not as strong as you.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:13.708
It's good that you know.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.416
Have some tea.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:29.500
Don't be mad.

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:34.208
The Special Branch is messing with you
because they're jealous of you.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.041
Don't worry. I'm here. I can handle them.

01:05:38.541 --> 01:05:40.916
But we're depending on you for this case.

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:46.708
The problem isn't you,
it's Chow Sing-sing.

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:50.958
That guy has gone too far.
He'll get in trouble sooner or later.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.875
You have to be careful too.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500
Here.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.875
Go have some fun.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.833
Here's my supplementary gold card.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.416
Are you teaching me what to do?

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:04.625
No.

01:06:05.125 --> 01:06:07.958
Don't ever say bad things
about my friend again.

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:12.583
I admire your strength
of character the most.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.416
Do you know?

01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:17.416
Everyone in the station respects you.

01:06:18.166 --> 01:06:22.416
They say you're righteous,
capable, and generous.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:27.416
If there were more people like you,
there would be world peace.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.458
So, what are you going to do?

01:06:32.666 --> 01:06:34.291
-Expel Sing from school.
-Good!

01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:44.125
I'm getting married soon.
There's no use following me around.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.416
I want to.

01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:47.125
You've got no future this way.

01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:48.375
I don't want a future.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.416
Give it to someone else
if you don't want it.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.458
Stop bothering me.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.416
What about me then?

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:58.041
Ask your mom. Why are you asking me?

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.625
Have you ever liked me?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:10.333
You know, it's only a game.
I'll be honest about that.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.416
Fuck you.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.791
Why? Am I contagious?

01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:26.875
Jacky said you're heartless
and told me not to be near you.

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:54.208
Class.

01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:58.041
Let's have a quiz today, okay?

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.625
Shut up!

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.208
Damn you!

01:08:20.583 --> 01:08:22.125
You're throwing erasers at me?

01:08:22.416 --> 01:08:25.708
When I was throwing erasers,
fishballs were only one cent per stick.

01:08:27.083 --> 01:08:28.208
Tell them the class is starting.

01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:29.958
You tell them.

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:31.625
Me?

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.708
You're the teacher.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.541
Where's your dignity?
How do you teach your students?

01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:37.583
Tell them.

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:40.416
-The class is starting.
-Louder!

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:44.000
-The class is starting!
-Say it in a complete sentence.

01:08:44.166 --> 01:08:45.875
The class is starting and today,

01:08:47.083 --> 01:08:48.375
we have a quiz!

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.583
The class is starting
and today, we have a quiz!

01:08:54.125 --> 01:08:55.166
Is that okay?

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.791
A quiz! Today!

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:03.958
Chow Sing-sing, come out.

01:09:05.166 --> 01:09:06.625
I'm not in a good mood, what do you want?

01:09:06.708 --> 01:09:08.208
Let me be clear, I have no choice.

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:09.833
Let me go first.

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:10.958
Mr. Principal.

01:09:11.041 --> 01:09:12.083
Hello, Mr. Principal.

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:14.958
-Hello, Chow Sing-sing, long time no see.
-Yes, I haven't seen you in school.

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:17.333
-How's business going?
-It all depends on the students.

01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:19.041
Hey, where do you get
your money from lately?

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.041
What are you saying?
I need you to give me some tips.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.125
I've taken over a Chiu Chow food stall
at Temple Street. Are you interested?

01:09:24.416 --> 01:09:26.458
A food stall? Yes.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:28.208
-Okay, I'll count you in.
-Well, thanks.

01:09:28.333 --> 01:09:30.958
-Hey, why are your parents looking for me?
-What parents?

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:32.208
-Your mom?
-Your mom.

01:09:32.291 --> 01:09:33.291
-Your mom.
-Your mom.

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.375
-She's here, Mrs. Chow.
-Yes!

01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:42.541
You bad boy, I'm here
to withdraw you from school.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:44.541
Mr. Principal?
I'm withdrawing my son from school.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:45.541
Welcome.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:47.375
Kids who can't study
in schools are pitiful.

01:09:47.458 --> 01:09:49.166
-Who said so?
-Hold it.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:50.916
-Who said I'm withdrawing from school?
-Me.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
-Hey, Madam.
-Madam? Call me Mom.

01:09:53.083 --> 01:09:55.000
What the heck? You did it with my dad?

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:57.875
Of course, how else would I have you then?

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:01.291
-So you won't acknowledge me now?
-She did it with my dad?

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:02.625
-I did too.
-Look.

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:04.958
I even brought
his birth certificate. Look.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.250
-His mom, Yu So-chau, that's me.
-What? You're Yu So-chau?

01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:12.291
Yes, I can prove she's Yu So-chau.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.000
Everyone, please be quiet.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.375
Give me time to think
about what is happening.

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:19.083
-Okay.
-Yes, kids must go to school.

01:10:19.166 --> 01:10:21.333
What? What are you talking about?

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:25.291
Look at me, what do you think I look like?

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:29.083
What? Yes, you've got it, I'm a hooker.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:33.666
Yes, I work at 167C Portland Street,
where you see a yellow signboard,

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:36.041
stating Young Jade Queen.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.833
And I've been working
as a hooker for 25 years.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:40.416
Come when you have time.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.416
How much do you charge?

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.625
-Hey.
-I just want to know.

01:10:44.166 --> 01:10:45.291
Just 100 dollars.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:48.166
And buy one, get one free. Gosh!

01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:51.625
For ten men per night,
I only get 500 dollars.

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:54.916
If I just lie there without moving
for the whole month,

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:56.541
I only have enough to survive.

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.625
Hold this for me.
I have to scold the bad boy.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.000
You bad boy!

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:03.833
You said you'll attend an English school
to get foreigners for me.

01:11:03.916 --> 01:11:07.291
But you came here for fun
and you won't even acknowledge me.

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:09.208
-I'm so pitiful.
-What?

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:12.666
How come a hooker has a gun?

01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:13.750
Yes.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:21.250
I even bought you a toy gun.

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:24.541
-He likes to play with toy guns.
-Thank you, Mom.

01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:27.541
Give it back to me.

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:29.625
-Didn't you say that you bought it for me?
-Yes. Give...

01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:31.916
-You bought it for me.
-Yes. I did...

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.166
-Then it's mine.
-Yes.

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:35.625
-I want to play with it and try it now.
-No.

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.916
-Look up.
-What's wrong? Let him play with it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.875
You love me so much, you bought me a gun.

01:11:39.958 --> 01:11:43.291
-Come, let's play.
-Play, but don't aim it at me.

01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:47.166
-She said don't aim it at her.
-Hey...

01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:49.000
Don't aim it at anybody.

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:52.916
Sing, playing with guns in school
is a serious crime.

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:56.291
-I want to study.
-No, put down the gun.

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:59.333
-I'll play with guns if I can't study.
-No.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.291
Are you all right?

01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:07.291
I'm fine.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:09.416
That gun is loud.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.125
Don't...

01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:16.875
The gun is here.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.750
This gun is so real.

01:12:20.916 --> 01:12:23.750
Don't play with guns. It's very dangerous.

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:26.250
What are you afraid of?
I'm in charge here.

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:32.333
The sound is so realistic.

01:12:34.458 --> 01:12:36.666
Wow! This gun is really powerful.

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.666
Mrs. Chow, where did you get
such a realistic toy gun?

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.750
Damn you!

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:42.833
Mrs. Chow, I'll teach your son a lesson.

01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:44.083
-Okay.
-Go!

01:12:45.916 --> 01:12:47.916
Hey, you really want
to mess things up for me?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.791
You're messing things up for me.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.541
What do you mean
by withdrawing me from school?

01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:52.666
What are you doing here?

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.416
I'm the one in charge.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:55.875
Don't be so heartless.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.750
I just want to help you.

01:12:57.833 --> 01:12:59.541
Help me? You just want to help yourself.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:00.666
You're so selfish.

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:02.750
Let me try it for once, okay?

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:05.083
Whether I would succeed or not,
I'll bear the consequences.

01:13:05.458 --> 01:13:09.250
My career, romance, and future
are all in your hands.

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:11.041
Leave now if you want to help me.

01:13:11.916 --> 01:13:13.333
Silence means yes.

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:15.125
It's only a toy gun.
Why are you so nervous?

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.041
It's a toy gun for kids.
Why is an adult like you playing with it?

01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:20.041
If you fire all my bullets,
how would I report it?

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:22.333
-Mrs. Chow. You can leave with your son.
-Okay.

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:26.166
Why are you in such a hurry?

01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.000
I'm leaving, bye.

01:13:28.583 --> 01:13:30.250
I was just playing around, why scold me?

01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:32.750
You disrespect her because she's a whore.
You deserve it.

01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:34.125
Go back to what you were doing.

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:45.208
Leader.

01:13:47.375 --> 01:13:48.333
You're leaving?

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:52.250
This is my phone number,
let's have tea some time.

01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:58.208
What is that?

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:01.583
The school map, it's good for escaping.

01:14:02.166 --> 01:14:04.083
-Did you draw it?
-No, I just found it.

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:13.083
Who would draw something like this?

01:14:15.833 --> 01:14:16.750
Here.

01:14:18.875 --> 01:14:20.583
Where did you get this map?

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.041
Chow Sing-sing gave it to me.

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:25.083
Where did Chow Sing-sing get it?

01:14:25.458 --> 01:14:27.125
I don't know.

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:31.125
Madam Wong, do you believe
in Chow Sing-sing?

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:33.458
I believe in Tat.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:35.708
I believe in Chow Sing-sing.

01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:37.125
I believe in Sing.

01:14:37.208 --> 01:14:38.541
How can I trust you guys?

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.708
I believe you.

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:44.833
Believe Sing. If Sing says so, it's true.

01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:49.083
Madam, I've spoken
with the Secretary of Security.

01:14:49.166 --> 01:14:51.250
The Regional Crime Unit
is no longer needed in this case.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:53.125
The Special Branch will
take care of it ourselves.

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:57.333
You can continue believing in Sing.

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.541
I'm sorry, Lydia.

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:05.708
Tat, I trust you.

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:16.666
Where's Sandy?

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:19.625
I don't know. Don't you see I'm busy now?

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:23.041
Are you kidding me?
I told you to keep an eye on her.

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:24.958
It seems she went downstairs.

01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:26.708
Why didn't you say so earlier?

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.916
Hey, there's still some more.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:31.708
Finish it.

01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:37.708
Come on, let's synchronize our time.

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:40.875
I have no watch.

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.875
Let's move.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:43.541
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:15:46.666 --> 01:15:48.791
Mr. Lee, we're in position.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.458
Hey, let's get drinks first.

01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:57.666
-Let's go.
-Okay.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:58.833
Roll the ball.

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:02.333
See you later.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.500
Hello...

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.875
-It's not working.
-Let me check it.

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:22.541
Let me tell you a secret.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:23.625
-What is it?
-What is it?

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.666
There are terrorists in Hong Kong.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:28.291
-You're crazy.
-You're crazy.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:21.416
Hurry.

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:37.333
Hello.

01:18:37.708 --> 01:18:38.541
Sing.

01:18:38.625 --> 01:18:40.125
Speak louder.

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:41.541
-Sing!
-Damn you!

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.500
What?

01:18:48.041 --> 01:18:50.083
Where are the guys from Special Branch?
Where's Uncle Tat?

01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:56.750
Call the police at once.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:57.875
I'll be there immediately.

01:19:02.958 --> 01:19:05.000
-Special Branch.
-Hello, I'm Chow Sing-sing.

01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:06.750
-Are you crazy?
-Hello...

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:09.333
Hello!

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.500
What's the number for the police?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.250
It's 999. Hurry!

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:46.083
Damn you!

01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:36.750
We're doomed.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:08.291
-Sir.
-Chow Sing-sing, why are you back?

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:11.500
There are heavily-armed terrorists
who currently have a group of hostages.

01:21:11.583 --> 01:21:13.625
I want you to dispatch
a team of SDU to save them.

01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:16.291
-I haven't received any orders for this.
-There won't be any

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.625
because I'm the only one
who knows this at this time.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.500
You used to be the captain here.

01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:23.583
We can't leave without any orders.

01:21:23.708 --> 01:21:25.458
I know, but people's lives are at stake.

01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:27.333
It's an emergency. There's no more time.

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:28.750
Sorry, I can't help you.

01:21:29.291 --> 01:21:31.333
-Then please lend me your warrant card.
-No.

01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:35.916
Chow Sing-sing, you want to go to jail?

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:45.166
Team Number 3, units A, B, C, move out.

01:21:46.791 --> 01:21:49.041
There are hundreds of lives
waiting for you to rescue.

01:21:49.166 --> 01:21:51.916
I'll take responsibility for everything.
Do you trust me?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:56.916
Move out!

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:07.750
Come on, let's go! Move it!

01:22:32.708 --> 01:22:33.666
Hold this.

01:22:35.541 --> 01:22:38.125
Under the pool, there's an air raid tunnel
where you can escape through.

01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:39.833
Follow me.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.458
That way.

01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:53.458
Hurry.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.166
Get away, let me do it.

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:09.541
Go.

01:23:13.416 --> 01:23:14.333
Go.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.875
Why is it suddenly so bright?

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:23.958
Where are my shades?

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:25.875
It feels uncomfortable without my shades.

01:23:26.416 --> 01:23:27.416
It's there.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:08.000
Damn it, the exit has been blocked.

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.458
I'll kill you, bastards!

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.791
How come it's a hotdog sandwich?

01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:46.500
Be careful, hurry.

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:49.541
-Be careful.
-Hurry.

01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:50.541
Police, freeze!

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.041
Don't shoot, we're on the same side.

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:55.791
-Inspector Chow, I met them in the tunnel.
-Sing.

01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:57.750
-Crouch.
-It's terrifying.

01:24:57.833 --> 01:24:59.500
The terrorists are terrifying.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:00.750
How did you get out?

01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:02.916
We escaped through
the underground air raid tunnel.

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:04.208
But it exploded earlier.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.041
-I think you can't go that way.
-Any injuries?

01:25:06.458 --> 01:25:09.208
No. We're all safe, except for me.

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:10.958
I told you, you're the best.

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:13.416
Yes, he's the best. Good thing he's here.

01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:20.291
Are there any more students inside?

01:25:20.375 --> 01:25:22.291
-I don't know, but Uncle Tat is inside.
-Uncle Tat?

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:24.166
-He saved us.
-He saved you?

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:26.958
-Like the Terminator.
-Terminator?

01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:28.208
But I wonder if he's dead.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:30.375
Let's go in at once!

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.166
Damn it.

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:39.458
Hey, hold on!

01:25:47.666 --> 01:25:50.833
I surrender!
It's unfair that it's two against one.

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:52.666
You'll learn your lesson
when my partner comes.

01:26:33.125 --> 01:26:34.041
Move in.

01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:44.750
Pay attention.
There must be more students inside.

01:26:59.791 --> 01:27:00.708
Lead them out!

01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:02.083
-Okay.
-Let's go.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:38.958
Listen, everyone. We're trying to find
a fat Chinese man with a mustache.

01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:40.083
Do you see him?

01:27:40.708 --> 01:27:41.541
No, sir.

01:27:43.875 --> 01:27:45.791
Sir, does he have
any other characteristic?

01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:48.250
Characteristic?

01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:53.333
Sleazy. He's very sleazy.

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:57.125
Does he have a pleasing personality?

01:27:57.958 --> 01:27:59.750
His personality?
Is this a blind date or what?

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.750
Who asked this stupid question?

01:28:29.291 --> 01:28:31.750
-Do you see him?
-No, we've searched all the classrooms.

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:00.208
-Hey!
-Aren't you Chow Sing-sing?

01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:01.333
-I'm Inspector Chow.
-Sir.

01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:02.958
-Have you seen Terminator?
-Which Terminator?

01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:04.625
-James Bond.
-Which James Bond?

01:29:04.708 --> 01:29:07.333
-The Director of Student Affairs.
-Who's the Director of Student Affairs?

01:29:07.791 --> 01:29:09.000
-Beat him up outside.
-Yes, sir.

01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:12.500
-Beat him up outside.
-Hey! Don't!

01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:50.208
Flash grenade.

01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:31.833
Inspector Chow, what now?

01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:33.791
-Get him out for first-aid.
-What about you?

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:35.000
Save his life first. Hurry!

01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:36.375
Here.

01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:40.291
Inspector Chow.

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:41.666
I'll cover you.

01:30:41.916 --> 01:30:43.333
Ready, go!

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.375
I'll kill all of you.

01:32:01.666 --> 01:32:03.333
Anybody still alive?

01:32:08.416 --> 01:32:09.875
Answer me if there is any.

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:14.166
I've reached the last machine room, over.

01:32:15.166 --> 01:32:16.458
Do you read me? Over.

01:32:18.458 --> 01:32:19.541
Hello.

01:32:24.708 --> 01:32:26.916
Sing. Relay.

01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:04.333
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

01:34:04.416 --> 01:34:06.208
Hey, where's the bullet?

01:34:07.083 --> 01:34:08.625
-Where did you hide it?
-In my back.

01:34:08.708 --> 01:34:09.625
Is it?

01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:12.750
It's inside.

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:15.958
You've been shot?

01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:18.625
You were pretending earlier?

01:34:19.416 --> 01:34:22.375
Young man, you have to be honest.

01:34:22.458 --> 01:34:25.250
-Don't always try to fool people.
-Cut the crap, I'm in pain.

01:34:25.333 --> 01:34:26.250
I'll call an ambulance.

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:27.416
-Hold it.
-Why?

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.208
Everybody is coming.
Let me get the credit first.

01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:32.208
You're being superficial again?

01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:34.958
What are you looking at? You are.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.750
He's not a police officer,
I'm going to arrest him.

01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:44.625
Chow Sing-Sing's actions were all part
of Regional Crime Unit's Tso Tat-wah's...

01:34:45.083 --> 01:34:46.083
Don't be rude.

01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:47.833
...plan.

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:49.541
I'll take responsibility for everything.

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:52.875
You've done a great job this time,
none of the students are hurt.

01:34:53.916 --> 01:34:56.208
Sir, you've agreed to not let
the RCU get involved in this case.

01:34:56.916 --> 01:34:57.833
I didn't.

01:34:57.916 --> 01:34:58.875
You did.

01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:01.166
There's an order here, see for yourself.

01:35:01.875 --> 01:35:03.583
You're becoming more and more hateful.

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.500
A hand grenade!

01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:23.291
Bastard, you dare interrupt me
while I'm talking.

01:35:23.375 --> 01:35:25.875
Don't think you won't get arrested
after death. Lock him up!

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:32.000
Who pushed me to the front?

01:35:32.458 --> 01:35:33.916
I'll deal with you later.

01:35:34.625 --> 01:35:35.541
Thank you.

01:35:38.416 --> 01:35:39.875
You got me in trouble this time.

01:35:40.541 --> 01:35:41.458
Sir.

01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:46.916
Was I rude this time?

01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:51.208
You've learned something at last
after being with me for so long.

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:54.375
Chow Sing-sing.

01:35:57.125 --> 01:36:00.958
You have done very well this time,
we welcome you back to the police force.

01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:04.541
However, I'm not interested
in working under the Traffic Unit.

01:36:04.833 --> 01:36:06.333
Don't worry.

01:36:06.416 --> 01:36:09.916
This time, you'll either become
a Chief Superintendent or Chief Inspector.

01:36:13.666 --> 01:36:15.708
I've heard that you've been shot?

01:36:15.791 --> 01:36:20.708
Yes, but to me, it is only a scratch.

01:36:20.916 --> 01:36:22.791
It's really nothing to me.

01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:26.833
Any requests?

01:36:26.916 --> 01:36:28.083
I want an ambulance.

01:36:29.291 --> 01:36:31.958
-Call an ambulance!
-Ambulance!

01:36:51.625 --> 01:36:53.000
Someone's courting me.

01:36:53.125 --> 01:36:54.708
Let's see if you can beat him first.

01:36:55.583 --> 01:36:56.541
Is that okay?

01:36:57.916 --> 01:36:59.291
I'm not a coward anymore.

01:37:02.833 --> 01:37:04.208
Did I say I'm courting you?

01:37:05.333 --> 01:37:07.041
I came here to learn about
flower arrangements.

01:37:09.458 --> 01:37:13.041
You bastard, you stole my girl.
I'll beat you up.

01:37:14.041 --> 01:37:15.083
I'll beat you up!
