00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.240
A dangerous threat to
peace between the East and West,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.240
Donovan Desmond.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.460
I've successfully enrolled
Anya in Eden Academy,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.870
where his son is enrolled,
in order to get close to him.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.880
Now, Anya just has to
earn eight Stella Star medals,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.880
which are given to honor
students for their achievements,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.060
and become a scholarship student...

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.170
...for me to infiltrate
Desmond's social gathering.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.530
However...

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.080
It's no easy feat
in such an elite school.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.600
Hence, I've prepared a backup Plan B,
dubbed The Friendship Scheme.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.750
I was supposed to have Anya
forge a good relationship with Damian,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.190
(Come on in!)
and if things went well, he might as well

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.280
(Welcome!)
introduce Anya and me to his parent, but...

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.910
Anya hit him on the first day of school,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.510
and earned a Tonitrus Bolt.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.120
Their relationship has plummeted, too...

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.050
No.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.030
It's still too early to give up.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.200
The operation has only just begun.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.980
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.010
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.890
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.660
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.630
On the template of happiness,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.180
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.390
We can't be as we are,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.730
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:04.920
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.820
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.030
they still don't disappear

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.620
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.720
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780
And I know

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.240
Every day is so mediocre,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.060
but I'm here and so are you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.530
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.010
(Mission: 7 - Target: The Second Son)

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.050
Good morning...

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.370
Morning, Yor.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.770
I've made us breakfast.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.520
I'm getting used to living
with these two somehow.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.240
Anya's still sleeping?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.560
Is she still scared of
what happened yesterday?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.890
I'm not going to scold you,
so come out already.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.040
Hurry up and eat, or you'll be late.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.930
I'm sorry for sucking at school...

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.050
I'm the one to blame here...

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.980
There's no use crying over spilt milk.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.950
Just be careful not to
pick any more fights.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.800
All right, cheer up, kid.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680
It's your first class today.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.940
You're so kind, Loid.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.460
Rather than pointing out her mistakes,

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.940
it'll be more constructive to spend
some thought on future planning instead.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.400
Besides, I can't risk making
her hate going to school

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490
and jeopardize the entire operation.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.640
For the mission,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.950
I need her to have a
smooth sailing school life at all costs.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.030
Also, be sure to apologize
to Damian at school.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.090
Got it?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.170
Yep. I'm off.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.720
Be a good girl, okay!

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.950
Time for us to go to work too.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.630
Right.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.340
I'm counting on you, Anya.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.390
World peace depends
on you two making peace.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.820
Time to do my best!

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.440
Have a good day, Lady Becky.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.220
A princess!

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.620
Oh, greetings, Anya.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.370
You live in a castle?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.350
Of course not.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.890
So you come here with a school bus?

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.650
I don't mind picking you up every morning
with my car from tomorrow, though.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.140
Anya will become a princess too?!

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.070
Nobody said anything about adopting you...

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.120
Huh... Boarding students don't have
to worry about traffic, I'm so jealous.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.640
Hm?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.340
Ugh...

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.280
What do you mean, "Ugh"?!
How rude!

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.680
Pipe down! It's still morning!

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.190
What did you just say?!

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.470
Humble yourself, girl!

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.620
What~ever.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.460
Be sure to apologize to him.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.660
Um...

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.020
Uh...

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.920
Anya...

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.300
Let's go, Anya.
Class is about to start.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.170
Hey, wait!

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.450
You'll just catch their
idiot germs if you talk with them.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.680
World peace...!

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.680
(He was worried about her,
so he followed her in the end.)

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.870
Don't get in my way, you Blackbell!

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.730
Hold on.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.940
If I recall, Blackbell and Desmond
Group are business partners...

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.480
Don't tell me that girl

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.500
was instructed by the enemy
organization to stand in our way...?

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.690
Wait, calm down, me.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.440
It's not possible.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.520
The first step is the most crucial
in forming a circle at school.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.160
I need to make sure
they reconciliate by today.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.460
Well...

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.900
Yeah...

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.240
She was the violent
girl yesterday, wasn't she?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.930
She's so scary!

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.590
Is the girl next to her a bully, too?

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.060
She went and hit him for no reason, huh?
Ain't that scary?

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.540
Give me a break. Why'd they put
me in the same class as a delinquent?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.780
I don't want to be hit by her...

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.060
How could she still be going to school?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.430
What a bother.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.340
School is scary...

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.200
People are really shallow, huh?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.820
They only see things
based on what they can see.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.680
Are you smart?

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.650
Not really, though.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.900
Anyway, it's not "you".
It's Becky.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.330
On your seats, everyone.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.430
I'd like to get closer to you, though.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.090
Because only I know
the good things about you!

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.670
Seriously, those two...

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.080
If they were to approach us...

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.800
School is scary, but...

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.720
I think I'll be okay.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.810
Hey, hey.
It's cute, isn't it?

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.250
Tch...

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.810
Why are you keeping quiet, Master Damian?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.120
That's right.
I am Damian Desmond.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.320
I was born the second son of a prominent
family and was raised with no obstacles.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.150
No one was ever
brave enough to oppose me.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.610
- The son of the Chairman...
- Even my brother never hit me.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.570
Damian!

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.380
And yet...

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.470
Damian!

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.490
Here.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.700
She gave me the first taste of a punch.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.870
You...

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.360
You...

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.550
You little...!

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.100
Johnny.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.840
Here.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.960
Jessie.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.570
Here.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.840
Carl.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:26.670
Here.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.600
All right,
since it's your first class today,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.630
(During the Maths Class)
for now, you all

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.970
(During the Maths Class)
have passed the difficult

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.920
(During the Maths Class)
entrance examinations and joined our school...

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.840
The relationship between this
and this should be put like this...

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.390
So that's why it should be like this,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.880
and this for this one...

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.780
So the answer for this
should be like this,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.350
and once we figure this out, we can find
the answer for this with the same method.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.170
She's already sleeping
during the first period...

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.870
So she's really a delinquent?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.960
So scary...

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.220
Anya! We're changing classroom now!

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.400
Wake up!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.650
The second son!

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.040
Anya must apologize to the second son!

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.930
The second son?

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.390
Oh, you mean Damian?
He's already left.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.380
Come on, forget about him already!

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.510
If I don't apologize to him,
I can't bring peace!

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.950
Oh, you mean peace
in the academy will be ruined?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.460
Well, yeah, I guess you can
never know what he'll be doing.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.820
But don't worry!
I'm on your side, Anya!

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.570
I'll protect you no matter what happens!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.000
Never mind him, then.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.110
Sure!

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.700
Mind him, please!

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.680
Father!

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.520
Tch!

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.290
I must tell her the importance
of saying sorry somehow!

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.250
(During the Science Class)
And just like this,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.300
(During the Science Class)
we can reflect sunlight with a mirror.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.720
The spot hit by the light
will become warm.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.050
Let's try using two mirrors

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.680
(Fortune-telling for Good Kids)
and do some experiment now.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.310
(It's a good day to apologize today.)

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.720
A message from God!

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.020
Apologize, Anya!
Make peace with him!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.480
I'm feeling a great pressure on me...

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.550
So John made up his mind.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.150
(National Language Class in Progress)
So John made up his mind.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.490
(National Language Class in Progress)
Even if he was left out of his circle,

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.500
he would stand up for what he believed in.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.490
Then, after that,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.570
(But John changed his mind.)
he would never say sorry to anyone anymore.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.610
My textbook looks different somehow...
(He thought sometimes it's important)

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.420
(to lower his head and come
to terms with each other.)

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.490
(Lunch Break)
Finally, lunch time!

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.420
Let's go to the cafeteria!

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.930
But this is definitely
a prestigious school.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.430
A serious full-time class right
from the get-go, huh?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.820
Phew... I'm pooped.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.050
Attention, all first year students.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.230
(Cafeteria)
Each of you may order

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.600
(Cafeteria)
anything you like from the menu.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.300
Hmm... Well, it doesn't hold a
candle to our chef's cooking, though.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.330
Anya wants omelet rice!

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.800
That's a strange meal.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.660
Oh, the second son!

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.900
Ugh, why don't they just
eat at the dorm?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.150
I need to apologize!

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.300
Forget it!

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.990
They're the ones in the wrong!

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.500
That kid!

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.470
This isn't working!
I need to get her off Anya!

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.870
Hey, new guy!
Where are you going?!

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.120
Becky Blackbell from Class 1-3.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.230
Please come to Ward A,
Student Hall at once.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.470
I'm still eating here!

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.310
At once!

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.220
Ah, geez!

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.990
Now's the chance!

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.750
Wh-What?!
You looking for more trouble?!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.820
Um...!

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.840
Master Damian wouldn't have been
hit by you had he not let his guard down!

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.760
Um...

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.410
Can it, you two.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.520
Are you going to tell
her yourself, Master Damian?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.890
Why am I at a loss for
words when facing her?!

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.230
Master Damian?

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.210
What the hell...

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.100
What's this fuzzy feeling in my chest?!

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.290
He's giving me the chills,
so I'll just apologize and run away...

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.190
She's up against Master Damian.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.300
I bet he'll rip her heart to pieces

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.290
with the ultimate insult
of his deliberation!

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.420
What will he say now to strike her?
Midget?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.300
Can't be something soft like that, can it?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.430
- U-Um...
- Ugly pig? Raccoon face?

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.810
Iron-fist gorilla girl?

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.080
- I-I'm...
- Those lame accessories look like horns!

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.480
- I'm...!
- Your mom's a fatty!

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.560
Short legs.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.660
Short legs!

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.950
Those lame accessories look like horns!

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.710
A commoner with a raccoon's face!

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.790
I'll catch your commoner germs,
so go away, you midget raccoon!

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.230
A short raccoon with short legs!

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.270
Short legs, short legs!

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.860
I'm...

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.330
I'm sorry for hitting you...

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.000
I'm sorry!

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.030
I actually want to...

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.610
...be friends with you!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.200
I'm sorry...!

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.180
Sorry for having short legs!

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.790
Th-This girl...

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.740
She's so remorseful that she's crying...?!

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.190
How very wistful of her!

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.850
Looks like I didn't have to step in.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.190
Good job, Anya.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.130
Master Damian? You're all red.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.580
This is, you know, anger!

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.200
I'm so angry...!

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.930
That's right!

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.620
She went up against me head-on yesterday!

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.430
Right...

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.940
Head-on...!

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.470
Straight ahead...!

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.380
She was staring at me...!

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.410
N-No... This isn't it!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.340
Stop beating so fast!

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.010
She's just an ugly commoner, and yet...

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.600
Wait, wait, wait.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.500
That would be embarrassing...

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.710
Curse you!
Like hell I'd admit it!

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.350
I won't forgive you!

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.070
My pride won't allow it!

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.540
That's Master Damian for you.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.470
He doesn't flinch at a girl's tears.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.090
We'll let you off the hook for today!

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.550
Master Damian!

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.050
He completely rejected...

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.510
...her apology?!

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.320
Plan B's stuck again?!

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.640
By the way, why are you running?!

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.140
Shut up!

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.410
(Friendship Points with Damian: ?)

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.310
School is scary...
(Friendship Points with Damian: ?)

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.610
(Friendship Points with Damian: ?)

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.190
Becky...
(Friendship Points with Damian: ?)

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.460
Who is it?!

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.100
Who called me here?!
(Ward A, Student Hall)

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.950
(Ward A, Student Hall)

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.920
The denominator is 3, so it should be 1/3.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.800
So three of 1/3 make 1.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.960
Simple, right?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.310
L-Loid.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.200
Maybe you should let her rest for a bit.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.140
No.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.970
She has to learn up
to this part for today.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.490
With the incident
the other day with Damian...

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.170
the Plan B to become intimate

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.060
- with the Desmond family,
- I won't forgive you!

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.270
- I won't forgive you!

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.620
- The Friendship Scheme...
- I won't forgive you!

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.500
- I won't forgive you!

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.180
- is completely done for.
- I won't forgive you!

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.020
Hence, I must at least increase the odds

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.140
with the initial plan, Plan A,
to make her a scholarship student...

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.400
If you can't finish this,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.680
you're not allowed to
watch the spy show in the evening.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.320
Now, what's the answer for this?

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.150
I'll just read Father's mind
and finish this quick!

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.160
Come on, use this formula for this...

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.460
As an approach to getting more Stella
Stars to advance to a scholarship student,

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.240
- she can get more stars from other than...
- In the planning to participate

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.830
- she can get more stars from other than...
- in the social gathering...

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.910
- ...in academic fields, such as sports...
- ...and as far as the level

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.530
- ...in academic fields, such as sports...
- of certainty goes...

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.330
- ...but we need to up
- ...there were attempts

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.740
- her academic skills first...
- by past agents to infiltrate...

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.380
Are you okay, Anya?

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.610
I'll read Mother's mind!

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.050
Mother, help me with this question...

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.570
Let's solve it together, then.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.810
Um, the determiner is 5,
so it should be 1/5...

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.900
So, to make it easier to understand,

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.750
we first separate all the four limbs...

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.750
Oh, but then the neck would be in the way...

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.590
Huh? Uh...

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.120
5... 5...

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.160
5 looks like an S, doesn't it?

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.580
Are you okay, Anya?!

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.580
What's wrong?
How come you can't solve this?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.380
Honestly, I have no idea
what she has no idea about.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.600
I hate studyiiiing!

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.890
Hey, wait up!

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.630
L-Loid!

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.750
I think you shouldn't
force her to do this...

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.150
But...

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.390
She must study more in order
to become a scholarship student!

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.990
But...

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.680
Is that what she wants as well?

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.380
That's...

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.610
It's to make my mission easier...

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.860
I just want Anya...

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.240
...to enjoy her school life to the fullest.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.740
Of course, studying is
also important to avoid expulsion...

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.360
I suppose so...

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.280
For a child like her,

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.250
academic achievements
must be outside of her interests.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.190
I'm sorry.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.260
I said something impertinent,
despite being an outsider...

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.980
No, it's okay.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.630
Thank you, Yor.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.760
I always lose my cool
when dealing with her.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.460
I'm sure it's the same
for other parents as well.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.420
Let's take a break, okay?
I'll brew you tea.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.360
Anya!

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.610
I made you hot cocoa.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.220
She's cooped in...

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.620
She's sulking, I guess.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.300
Anya will work hard at school!

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.480
She reminds me of my
brother when he was young.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.300
She'll come out eventually.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.890
By the way, your brother's an officer
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, right?

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.580
I bet he did well in school.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.500
Did you teach him at home, Yor?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.640
If you have any tips,
I'd be happy to listen.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.980
Yuri's a more capable boy than me.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.690
So I hate to admit this,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.160
but it was me who was taught
a lot of things by him instead.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.540
Whenever we studied together,
he'd always...

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.930
You're wrong, Sis.
Spiders are not insects.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.360
An insect is a creature with six legs,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.170
and its body is split between
a head, a chest, and a stomach!

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.760
You know everything, don't you, Yuri?

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.260
Whenever I praised him,
he'd put on a bright smile...

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.960
Sis! I'll teach you about history next!

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.270
O-Okay!

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.570
I guess he was having
quite some fun teaching me.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.300
If I left him be,
he'd just be studying all the time.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.640
Wake up, Sis!

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.040
I've memorized the
multiplication table! Watch me!

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.070
I see.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.100
So his motivation was so that
he could be praised by his sister, huh.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.070
I don't know about that,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.650
but if that was the case,

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.290
then I guess you could just
become someone like that to Anya.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:29.800
You could praise her for
even her smallest effort she makes.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.260
I think she'll be happy with that.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.170
Well...

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.600
I don't know.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.020
I'm not her real parent, after all.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.000
Wait, it's not that.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.300
That's right.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.580
I was supposed to be the ideal father.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.880
I had to perfectly carry out the act.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.280
That was supposed to
be the basics of this mission.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.530
But how about it?

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.780
Everything I did up until today
was far from ideal.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.780
As a father, I'm...

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.970
Don't worry!

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.930
Please believe in yourself!

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.050
Didn't Anya say it herself that
we scored a perfect 100 to her?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.570
You're a great father to her.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.170
That's what she thinks of you!

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.100
I appreciate your kind words.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.670
I'm sorry for being impertinent again,
despite being a stranger...

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.350
No, Yor.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.500
You're not a stranger nor an outsider.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.320
You are the mother
of the Forger family now.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.020
I'm counting on you...

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.570
...to become one of her parents.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.860
R-Right.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.450
I'm a housewife.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.080
Make sure to keep it in mind
when you're outside, okay?

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.070
If you'd like,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.150
please teach Anya as well.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.700
If you're okay with me, I'd be happy to.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.220
Let's not rush things and do what we can.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.860
Right.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.330
Don't rush it, Twilight.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.400
If I were to assassinate
Desmond alone to wrap it up,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.020
I'd have multiple ways to do it, but that
wouldn't be able to tie the loose ends.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.110
You can't always
kill two birds with one stone.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.470
I have to get close to
him and gain his trust,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.700
and observe what
he's thinking and what he wants.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.800
A spy is the only one who can perform
that unsophisticated and painstaking duty.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.560
And it all starts...

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.580
...from getting to know about Anya first.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.950
Oh, it's already this late?

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.110
I'll go talk to Anya for a bit.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.910
I'll go wash the dishes, then.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.010
Hey, Anya.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.160
The spy show's about to begin now.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.340
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.300
We'll think about how we study
for the next session after the show's over.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.210
Anya...?

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.740
She fell asleep, huh.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.380
You'll catch a cold, you know.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.500
She was studying on her own...?

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.790
All for Father...

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.150
Guess I'll just record the show for her.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.900
Don't kill Father...

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.020
What's she dreaming about?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.080
A great father, huh...

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.650
If I had a real family,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.050
what would I feel about it?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.980
Fighting with each other

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.320
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.720
On this mischievous planet

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.230
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.100
My tears have run dry

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:12.370
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.740
I met you

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.430
where I came spilling out

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.430
You with all your secrets

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:23.880
Pretending to be normal

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.030
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:35.580
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.240
We made a deal that day

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.220
Thicker than blood

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.360
A pact from heart to heart

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.100
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.920
What should we eat tonight?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.650
"Here's what happened today"

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.150
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.120
Any and every day is

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.690
A comedy with you

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.530
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.610
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:16.420
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.540
Hm?

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.130
Oh, Yuri!
What's up?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.000
Oh, long time no see, Mr. Dominic.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.690
I've been too busy with work,
I couldn't go home at all.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.570
I couldn't expect less from the
elite of Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.770
Oh, right.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.150
How was the party
the other day, Mr. Dominic?

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.640
What kind of man did Yor go with?

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.760
Yor?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.880
Well...
Anyway, congrats.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.200
Huh? You haven't met him yet?

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.220
Huh...?

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.280
She...

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.780
Got married...?

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.950
