00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.000
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.880
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.990
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.680
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.650
On the template of happiness,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.050
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.450
We can't be as we are,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.820
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.120
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.830
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.110
they still don't disappear

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.650
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.590
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800
And I know

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.320
Every day is so mediocre,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.930
but I'm here and so are you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.400
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.580
(Mission: 11 - Stella)

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.500
No way... All our pursuers are...

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.180
Let's go back to the
hideout and rethink our steps.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.610
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.510
N-No way...!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
How can this be possible, Bondman?!

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.190
Ugh... How could I let this slide?!

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.880
- Hey, wake up! What happened?!

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.960
- Hey, Anya.
- Hey, wake up! What happened?!

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.690
- Anya's busy now.
- Hey, wake up! What happened?!

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.640
- Anya's busy now.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.430
This tragedy...

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
Nooo!!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.180
- I hate studyiiiiing!!

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.540
- Hold it right there!
- I hate studyiiiiing!!

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.540
I thought we agreed
to start studying at 5?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.450
Hieeehh!!

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
A devil!

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.190
- You're a devil, Father!
- Operation Strix: Phase 2.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.450
In order for me to participate in
my target's social gathering,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.590
I need to turn my daughter, Anya, into
a scholarship student, an Imperial Scholar.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.560
And for that, she needs to
achieve excellent academic performances...

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.250
...in order for her to earn a Stella.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.610
The answer for that isn't A, but E.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.070
B-But, Loid...

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.500
Anya scored pretty good in maths.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.990
Well done, Anya.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.990
I only have 2/8 rounds left!

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.870
Was it from watching the cartoon?

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.520
Oh, right.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.000
This proverb is the same
one Bondman said in Episode 16!

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.470
I forgot.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.840
Try to remember it!

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.940
Come on, it's the episode where the
man with sideburns appeared...

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.390
I just happened to read the wrong
minds to cheat during the exams.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.660
I'll just take my time...

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.410
...to see for myself to decide
who's best at which subject,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.420
and then I'll definitely get
a perfect score in every subject.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.840
No sweat.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.060
I tried saying it like Father.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.160
Sure, I could just forge her
scores to A+ behind the scene easily,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.090
but if she suddenly got
good scores overnight,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.820
the school and the people
around her would be suspicious.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.660
In order to naturally disguise the forgery,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.170
she must improve
her basic academic skills first.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.160
If she becomes estranged from her friends,
her school life may suffer as well.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.230
- I can't have her refuse to go to school...
- If I read my friends' minds

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.280
- and get perfect scores,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.300
they'll hate me...

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.750
How could you possibly know that?!

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.690
You creepy little witch!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.410
I guess I was too harsh
in enforcing her to study.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.740
When her motivation to study is low,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.100
her focus will never improve,
resulting in slumped learning efficiency.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.010
It's always good to make a change.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.710
Academics aren't
the only field to obtain a Stella.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.710
All right.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.640
Let's take a break
and draw pictures instead.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.210
For instance, arts.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.720
Wow, that's a cool drawing.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.320
Is it a cheetah?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.810
Oh, wait.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.630
It must be a panda, right?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.730
It's a cow, the one in the school.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.330
Or maybe music!

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.480
Here's a violin for kids.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.990
Or maybe even sports!

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.570
Come on, don't cry.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.800
Calm down, Twilight.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.140
A thousand-miles journey
begins with a single step.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.450
She's still in the first grade, too.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.970
I need to take the time to find out
her strongest suits and improve them.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.060
Should we play skipping?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.820
It'll be fun!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.170
Right, don't be so hasty.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.070
It's not like Desmond's
going to make a move this instant.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.450
Planning for war must take an
enormous amount of time.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.010
However...

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.460
We expect you to achieve eight
Stella Stars in about four months...

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.130
Do we really have that
much time to spare?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.410
Father...

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.460
Anya will work hard!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.960
Anyway, do you mind
untangling this rope first?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.470
Oh, right...

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.330
Hey, Anya.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.850
Hm?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.010
Why don't we go for a walk tomorrow?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.270
A wok?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.670
Aside from academics, arts, and sports,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.860
there's one more field in
which one can obtain a Stella.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.850
Social contributions.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.370
Thank you for participating in our
parent-child volunteer program today!

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.750
I'll explain the details of
your work today right away, then.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.890
- We'll be assigning each family to a job.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.830
- In the past,
- We'll be assigning each family to a job.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.250
- We'll be assigning each family to a job.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.630
many have received Stella Stars
for their participation

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.290
in public services
for extended periods of time.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.220
There are some cases of
people receiving one...

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.270
...for saving lives or helping to
apprehend criminals, but these are rare.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.570
Sure, I could just ask WISE to send its
personnel to stage the whole thing,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.900
but it's no easy feat
considering the various risks.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.020
Well, even if Anya's not
getting a Stella right away,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.900
there's no harm in having her
develop a philanthropic spirit.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.280
All right, then...

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.790
I'd like you to handle the cleaning
of this changing room, Mr. Forger.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.390
There's a pool there!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.170
It's for the patients' rehab.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.180
Ah...

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.210
Perhaps it's a bit too much for you?

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.940
Well, then, please arrange
the books in the library instead.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.600
Excuse me, Mister!
Come with me!

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.860
Could you please do something else?

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.180
Anya's tired of doing chores.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.880
Anya wants to be the one
giving tools to a doctor.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.610
Huh?

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.380
I'll go look for the operating room!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.630
Hey, wait! Stop!

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.630
Ah!

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.640
I've had enough!
Get out of here now, you two!

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.300
I'm sorry...

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.900
Don't worry about it.
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.430
But still...

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.100
If there's little hope of getting a Stella
from social contribution, what should I do...

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.710
Hey, is the rehab going to be tough?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.130
It is, but you gotta do your
best so that you can run again!

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.750
Uh...

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.890
3 minutes left now!

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.420
Hey, is the water cold?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.100
It's fine, go and get changed now.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.980
I'll also get myself changed.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.560
- Okay! One, two, one, two...

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.680
- This one's for the adults, huh...
- Okay! One, two, one, two...

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.340
- This one's for the adults, huh...
- Focus on your toes now!

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.940
- Focus on your toes now!

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.440
Figures. The water's a bit cold...

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:09.950
Whoa!

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.340
Ken?

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.450
Is he still in the changing room?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.960
Maybe I should ask HQ
to rethink the plan...

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.460
I can't breathe...

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.720
I can't... move my legs!

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.450
The pool! Father!

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.980
What? If you need a toilet,
just go by yourself.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.240
Someone's drowning in the pool!

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.550
Huh?! How can you tell?!

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.320
Who are you?!

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.340
Help...

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.780
Help...

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.190
Father...

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.870
Anya sucks at volunteering...

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.970
So...

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.020
I want to become a swimmer,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.140
so I'll go practice at the pool!

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.730
Huh?! Hey, wait!

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.380
I told you, that pool's not for public use!

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.380
Ken?

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.010
Don't tell me he backed out...

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.720
- Uwaaaaahh!!

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.810
- Hey, wait!
- Uwaaaaahh!!

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.690
Where are you from?!

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:22.810
Aahh!

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.560
Pool is so fun!

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.790
Who's that?

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.770
Where's the drowning person?!

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.800
I'm...

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.640
...dying...

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.610
What are you doing, Miss?!

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.850
I can't...

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.500
You okay?!

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.990
Ken!

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.830
Father...

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.860
Someone call a doctor, please!

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.330
I was about to swim...

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.360
When I found he was sinking...

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.840
Ken!

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.700
Are you okay?!

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.460
- Ken! No way...

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.360
- Calm down, Ma'am.
- Ken! No way...

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.590
Is he okay?!

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.730
Ken! Ken!

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.130
There're so many people here, too...

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.240
Did you hear any sound?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.410
I'm sorry! I didn't think you'd drown...

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.110
It's called instinctive drowning response.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.570
When a child is drowning,

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.170
they surprisingly tend to be silent.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.370
There are many cases where a lot
of them disappear without anyone noticing.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.790
Please always keep
an eye on him next time.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.490
Still, good job spotting him in the water.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.560
I saw bubbles in the water.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.340
Don't be so reckless next time.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.390
Thank you! Thank you!

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.560
Good job, Miss!

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.410
Anya Forger from Cecile Hall, First Year.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.740
We'll award you with
a Stella for saving a life.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.010
Way to go, Anya!

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.990
You're the first among the
first grade to receive a Stella!

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.030
- You're making me proud as well!
- Ultra amazingly elegant indeed, Miss Forger.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.330
- Good job, Anya!
- Ultra amazingly elegant indeed, Miss Forger.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.010
She beat me to it...

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.060
That's wonderful, Anya!
You're so amazing!

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.770
I'm so happy for you!

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.910
An unexpected Stella is in our hands now.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.610
An ideal result, indeed...

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.780
But I wonder...

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.330
More than that...

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.530
It's the same pride I felt...

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.590
...when I prevented a terrorist attack.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.860
Well done.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.110
Anya's been a help to people?

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.880
Ehe!

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.580
All right! I'll make us
some meals to celebrate!

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.210
Anya prefers Father's cooking.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.390
Shock!

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.890
(Respect from Everyone: +100)

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.790
I heard your daughter
has obtained a Stella,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.360
Agent Twilight.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.040
Yes, Handler.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.240
It's all thanks to you.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.770
At this rate,

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.710
looks like we don't need other agents...

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.710
...to try and stage for your
daughter obtaining Stella Stars.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.350
People will be suspicious of it.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.630
Besides, we can't risk exposing
the identity of our valuable personnel,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.010
or having them arrested.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.610
I suppose so.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.690
So HQ is getting impatient now?

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.110
No...

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.410
But there has been an increase
in suspicious money transactions...

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.000
...in some of the businesses
around Desmond.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.080
It's not an optimistic situation either.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.410
Make contact with Desmond
as soon as possible.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.000
Just give your daughter a candy
or something to motivate her.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.410
Morning!

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.040
You saw the show last night?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.780
I forgot my homework...

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.320
Oh, is that the girl from
Class 3 who suddenly got a Stella?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.050
I heard it's the fastest record to date now!

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.670
She saved a life?

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.730
My star's shining too bright,
it makes me stand out.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.570
Good morning, Anya!

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.330
It's Starlight Anya for you.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:41.750
Huh?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.090
Uh... Yeah, sure...

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.040
You're really popular now, huh!

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.960
Maybe you can make 100 friends
if everyone respects you now!

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.600
Huh!

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.600
Bam!

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.720
I see you in a new light now, Miss Anya!

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.100
Please be my friend!

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.610
Come to our house
with your parents next time!

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.610
Bam!

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.110
Well done, Anya!
My mission's complete now!

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.890
The world is now at peace.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.260
Don't be so full of yourself!

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.740
What the heck?! He's so annoying!

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.450
It's different from what I'd planned.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.880
The world is in danger.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.250
Let's go, Anya.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.380
Let's go... Starlight Anya.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.120
Yep.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.730
What a drag...

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.950
Heh... What a joke.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.740
She's really full of herself, huh.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.900
Putting on her badge for show...

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.320
You don't usually put that on
and go to school, do you?

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.260
That violent girl
can't be saving lives, can she?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.570
I heard she saved a kid from drowning...

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.500
But I bet she deliberately pushed
him and tried to drown him herself.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.260
Could be!

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.970
Or maybe she bought a Stella
from the school with a lot of money?

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.680
Oh, but she doesn't seem
to be that rich, though?

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.200
Shock...

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.300
Oh, don't mind them.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.930
They're just jealous.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.260
You think so too, right, Damian?

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.320
She must be cheating, right?

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.520
Do you really think our school

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.600
is just a third-rate school that'd randomly
give a Stella for a sum of money...

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.520
...or something?

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.700
Well...

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.240
If you're not happy with this school,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.830
then why don't you
just transfer to another school?

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.100
He's so mature at times like this!

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.840
So cool!

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.580
I'm irritated exactly because
she beat me to it not out of fluke!

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.380
Wow, so he's really a serious guy, huh?

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.600
Come on, class is starting now.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.610
Anyway,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.160
have you decided
on your reward yet, Anya?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.210
I mean, Starlight Anya.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.120
Reward?

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.610
That's right!

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.690
It's only natural for someone
to get a reward...

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.520
...after they've passed an exam
or won a contest, right?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.140
I can get peanuts?

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.630
Come on, ask for something
more expensive instead!

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.160
My parents bought me a cute dress
and a tiara for my exams the other day!

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.890
But, well...

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.850
I guess some of the rewards
I got weren't so fancy.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.140
Huh!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.900
Is your family a secret organization
that conquers the world?!

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.650
What do you mean?
We're just a normal corporation.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.210
Then Anya wants a castle!

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.820
I don't think that's within
the realm of possibility here.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.340
You don't have a place to place it either.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:59.660
Then...

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.010
A one-year supply of peanuts?

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.570
That's an easy one, though...

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.220
But are you really okay with that?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.240
Reward is so confusing...

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.250
Yeah, I guess.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.580
Well, I guess Wiesel
is the best reward I've ever got.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.180
Oh, he's my dog.
And what a cute dog he is!

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.680
Wiesel!

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.150
A dog?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.250
You also have a dog, second son?

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:32.880
Hm?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.950
Huh? A dog?

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.200
Why are you asking him?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.700
Max!

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.700
Who cares?

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.900
Don't talk to me so casually!

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.200
Anya's got a dog too!

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.760
All right! Let's see who's cuter,
my Max or your dog!

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.470
Bring him to my house,
and get your parents too!

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.430
Greetings, Mr. Forger.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.430
Let's just stop the war, Mr. Desmond.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.260
The world is now at peace.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:10.620
Heh.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.440
Huh?

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.440
So you want...

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.360
...a dog for your reward?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.160
Yes.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.800
Having a pet dog will bring peace.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.010
Peace? You mean to your heart?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.580
Hmm... Well, yeah, I've been thinking
of buying you something for a reward, too...

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.460
Anya.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.530
Having a pet will be tough, you know?

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.680
You must take responsibility for it.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.260
Responsibility...

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.010
A dog, huh?

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.480
Well...

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.310
Let me consider it for a bit.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.530
Loid...

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.720
Father...

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.020
If the dog's well-trained,

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.090
it can act as an extra layer
of security for this house.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.300
Dogs are so ferocious...

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.040
I'm worried if Anya
would be bitten to death by one...

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.590
Anya wants a small and cute dog...

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.200
Huh?

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.930
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.150
Well, I guess there are
some small but clever dogs.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.560
I'll just have WISE provide one for me.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.210
All right, let's go visit
the pet shop this weekend.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.640
So the buyer's decided yet?

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.260
Hmm... They're still reluctant for now.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.460
They're just some thugs
pretending to be revolutionary...

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.480
What, they're gonna turn it
into a bomb dog or something?

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.980
What poor animals these guys are.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.030
They've all been tinkered to the bones
to become human's toys.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.490
Shut your traps, you stupid dogs!

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.500
Keep barking and you'll get no food!

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.940
These dogs don't look like
they got the brains for anything.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.000
Hey, are Number 3 and
Number 5 getting sicker?

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.510
Like hell I'd care!
Just leave them!

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.220
Man, this place really stinks.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.030
Anya wants this one...

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.340
Or this one!

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.780
It looks tame and safe.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.980
Fighting with each other

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.320
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.820
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.230
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.200
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.470
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.840
I met you

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.530
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.530
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:05.980
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.990
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:17.540
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.340
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.490
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.460
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.200
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.020
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.750
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.150
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.220
Any and every day is

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.790
A comedy with you

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.630
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.710
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:58.520
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.900
