00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.000
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.010
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.680
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.600
On the template of happiness,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.150
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.360
We can't be as we are,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.700
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.790
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.830
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.000
they still don't disappear

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.590
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800
And I know

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220
Every day is so mediocre,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
but I'm here and so are you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.400
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.990
(Mission: 8 - The Counter-Secret
Police Cover Operation)

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.200
What's the answer
for this solution, then?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.000
Anya Forger.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.000
3/3!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.510
That was totally incorrect.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.730
How are you doing, Twilight?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.020
With your daughter's
academic skills, that is.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.030
We expect you to achieve eight
Stella Stars in about four months...

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.190
Four...?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.200
No sweat, Ma'am.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.030
You've become a lousy liar, haven't you?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.700
I could guarantee eight
Tonitrus Bolts in two months, though...

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.910
Oh, well.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.540
By the way,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.500
our informant within the city hall
was busted this morning.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.750
The enemy is tightening their grip.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.880
Be sure to take precautions, Twilight.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.550
You can never tell...

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.750
...where they might be
watching from, not only in the city,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.260
but even inside Eden College.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.760
The counterintelligence agency
in this country is quite formidable.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.770
Wh-What do you guys want?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.280
We're from the
State Security Service.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.700
Jim Hayward, I presume?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.280
We're bringing you in
on suspicion of espionage.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.200
E-Espionage?!
What are you talking about?!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.290
H-Hey!

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.120
Stop it! Let me go—

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.000
We'll hear your defense at the office.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.220
That's what happened this morning!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.720
It totally freaked me out!

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.890
I heard that person from
the finance department,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.020
who was taken away, was selling off
documents from the city hall.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.230
So he's a bad person!

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.310
Morn'...

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.190
Oh, morning.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.980
Good morning, Camilla.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.820
Oh, right, Yor.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.400
I heard it from my boyfriend,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.580
but you never told your
brother about your marriage?

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.290
You're right! I forgot!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.000
Huh? For a year straight...?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.790
What should I do now...

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.840
He said he'll be making
a call this way later.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.300
My goodness!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.420
I never told him about
my new home number!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.340
I was so relieved after the registration
that I let a lot of things slip away!

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.340
Hey, is your brother a hot guy?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.850
Wow! He's so cute!

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.980
Yes! Yuri is really cute!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.890
(State Security Service HQ)
He'd always stick to me

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.610
(State Security Service HQ)
while saying, "Sis, Sis!"

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.480
(State Security Service HQ)
He's a weirdo, then? I'll pass.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.980
He's a weirdo, then? I'll pass.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.150
I can't believe you forgot
to tell your brother,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.900
who adores you so much,
about your wedding...

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.820
Isn't that just cruel?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.820
Now, let's start again
from the beginning.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.500
What kind of files and how many
copies did you take out of the city hall?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.000
What's the name and description of your
client, and how did you contact them?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.500
When, where and how many
times did you meet them?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.840
Take me home.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.840
The State Security Service.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.680
- An organization that aims to

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.550
- You'd love a meaningful chat
- An organization that aims to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.600
- You'd love a meaningful chat
- maintain domestic security,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.720
- as I would, right?
- its main tasks include

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.310
- Mr. Hayward.
- hunting spies and monitoring citizens.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.890
They routinely assault, wiretap, threaten,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.900
and torture their suspects
for their missions.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.110
Hence, they earn the nickname "Secret
Police" from the citizens, scared of them.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.820
Good afternoon, 1st Lieutenant.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.900
Boss said it's time
for me to take over.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900
Okay.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.700
Well, then...

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.120
I'll leave the rest to you,
2nd Lieutenant Briar.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.700
Roger that!
I'll do my best!

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.910
Yuri Briar, 20.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.250
The man was a Secret Police officer.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.090
Why did Boss let that
optimistic dude in our team?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.010
Sure, he's a smart guy,
I'll give him that.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.880
But he's just a kid...

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.510
He was an elite in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and skipped grades, huh?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.700
Well...

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.890
Huh? I mean,
he's cute, right?

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.730
He looks like a puppy.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.810
That's what Boss said.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.230
R-Right...

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.240
Well, an organization like us
could use a guy like him.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.910
Besides, when he's on
his game, he's on his game.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.990
You'd lose your cool before him...

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.410
Hello, Mr. Hayward.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.740
I'm not speaking unle—

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.500
My sister works in
the city hall just like you!

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.120
Huh?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.420
Do you know her?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.210
She's my beautiful,
kind, proud sister!

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.010
I'm going to celebrate
her wedding tonight!

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.470
It's been a while since
we last met, so I can't wait!

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.010
With that being said, I'd like to
wrap this up quick and head home.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.970
So please cooperate
and tell me everything.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.890
I-I don't know anything!

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.400
Here are some pictures of the deal.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.560
Isn't this you, Mr. Hayward?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.110
Hey, wait!

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.690
Where did you keep
all these pictures until—

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.780
Excuse me.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.450
I forgot to turn them in.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.830
It's better for you to be honest.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.830
So I just handed the documents and
got my money as he told me.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.000
I don't know anything about him,
aside from him being from the West.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.210
Even his name.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.680
Did you see anything strange
in his speech and body language?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.390
Do you think they befitted his age?

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.850
I-I don't know.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.430
I see.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.390
Then...

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.350
Are you familiar with
the name "Twilight"?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.520
Who's that?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.320
He's a spy from the West.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.860
A master of disguise.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.780
He's an agent of evil that
has plunged this country into chaos.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.780
You could call him our natural enemy.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.410
I-If I help you guys catch him,

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.330
you'll let me go, right?

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.000
Do you know something?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.080
Wait, let me remember...

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.630
You'll only make yourself look worse
if you state nonsense.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.340
So be careful, okay?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.630
I was just trying to get some money
to play with some girls!

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.680
I meant no harm at all!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.800
You have a wife, don't you?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.260
You'd feel me as a fellow guy, right?!

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.600
I just sold off a piece of documents,
so you can't call this a political crime!

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.890
Please let me off the hook, okay?!

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.610
You see, Mr. Hayward...

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.690
I'm keeping it a secret from my sister
that I'm working for the Security Service.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.110
It a dangerous line of work,
so I can't make her worry about me.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.410
And above all...

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.200
I don't want her to find out
that I'm doing some dirty work...!

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.790
What you did was treason, Mr. Hayward.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.750
To you, it might only
be a piece of documents,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.010
but that one piece could put many
lives in our country at risk!

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.880
You understand?!

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.220
Unlike you, Sir...

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.890
I love my family, my sister.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.890
I'll do anything in order to protect
this country where she lives.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.600
Anything.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.820
No matter how much you're torturing me...

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.860
I'll never sell off my friends!

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.780
You're a stubborn one, eh, Bondman!

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.040
I wish she could bring this
level of focus to her studies too...

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.000
I only have two rounds left!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.790
How many rounds does
Bondman's pistol have?

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.900
Hm?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.040
I think his pistol has eight rounds in it.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.550
2/8!

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.590
Yeah! That's right!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.800
I only have 2/8 rounds left!

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.430
I can't believe you know those words.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.810
It's easier for her to understand
if we compare it to a cartoon, huh?

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.940
W-W-We're in trouble, Loid!

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.600
Welcome back, Yor.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.440
I only have 2/8 bullets left!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.690
My brother Yuri is coming
here today, apparently!

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.410
Today?!

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.910
That's what happened...

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.620
And he said he really
wanted to come celebrate with us...

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.620
What should we do now?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.410
What if our cover gets blown?

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.210
Don't worry.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.420
I've prepared a "complete set of
loving couples" for such occasions.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.010
Father and Mother flirting?

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.260
No way!

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.810
Mother's brother still not coming?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.310
He's your uncle.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.020
Uncle...

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.690
It's already late,
so don't force yourself.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.530
Anya wants to meet Uncle too...

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.530
Looks like he's still in the office.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.910
I just lost my temper and
dragged the whole interrogation...

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.920
Ah, but...

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.790
I finally get to see Sis
after a long while!

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.420
La-la!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.420
Oof!

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.720
My ribs, which my sister
broke in the past, are aching!

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.890
My whole body's going numb
recalling the love she wrapped me in!

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.390
But how come she never told me
that she's married for a whole year?

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.900
Don't tell me her husband is some vicious
person whom she can't introduce to me?!

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.030
I'll wipe off all threats...

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.410
...from this country
where my sister lives.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.160
Even if that means her husband.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
Loid Forger.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.950
If he turns out to be
a bastard threatening my sister,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.160
I'll throw him in jail immediately!

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.040
Wait, calm down, me.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.670
I can't let them see my true face.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.630
I have to keep my true identity hidden...

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.670
...to protect my work happiness as well.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.680
Yuri Briar.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.890
The only relative for the Forgers.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.550
The closer you are to someone, the more
likely they'll catch you off guard.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.100
I can't afford to lose this family...

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.940
...that I've built so well here
and now, so I must be careful.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.940
All people have a side of themselves
they can't reveal to others.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.700
To friends, to lovers...

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.450
Or even family...

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.990
- Hello there!
- They hide with their fake smiles...

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.450
- It's your brother Yuri!
- They hide with their fake smiles...

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.080
- and bluffs their real intentions...

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.450
- Welcome!
- and bluffs their real intentions...

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.290
That is how the world is
mending a temporary peace.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.720
Foreign Minister Windsor held a meeting
with Western Foreign Minister Brantz...

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.260
...on the 6th to normalize diplomatic
relations between the two countries...

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.600
- I'll confirm it myself.
- I'll ascertain it myself.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.220
- Whether or not this man
- Whether or not this man

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.390
- is a detriment to our family.
- is worthy of being her husband.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.730
No, he's obviously not worthy!

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.900
Let me take your coat and luggage.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.610
No, I'm good.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.570
Thank you.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.740
If you don't mind a simple meal,
I'll prepare it right away.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.410
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.030
Oh, don't mind me.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.200
Who would want to eat your cooking?!

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.120
Now that's a scary look you have.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.420
Are you nervous?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.000
I-I'm not!

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.840
This is bad.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.750
My animosity was showing on my face.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.010
- Just make yourself at home.
- Maybe it's because

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.510
I just finished an interrogation...

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.420
- I must play the role of
- I must play the role of

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.720
- a serious civil servant in front of her!
- a charming wife in front of Yuri!

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.590
I can't just go and tell him
that I married Loid...

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.520
...because I want to keep
working as an assassin!

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.020
Thank you for the flowers, Yuri.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.310
Yeah...

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.730
But, Sis...

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.030
I still haven't approved of your marriage.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.900
Why did you keep it a secret for a year?

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.610
I won't be convinced unless you tell me!

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.280
Of course he'd pursue her.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.780
Now...

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.580
About your brother, though,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.330
why don't we just tell him everything?

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.790
That single women are
viewed with suspicion by the public...

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.420
...and it's a serious
problem in this day and age.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.010
I'm sure he'll understand, right?

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.720
No, he won't!

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.220
My brother can be
a bit neurotic sometimes...

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.390
I mean...

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:08.100
If he finds out that I married
someone I don't even love,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.940
I'm sure he'll be distraught.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.690
And I'll be bothering you as well.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.570
Also, I just don't want him to
worry so much about me.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.820
Hmm...

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.610
D-Don't worry!

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.740
I've thought of the ultimate reason!

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.490
I know Yuri better than anyone else,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.910
so please leave it to me!

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.330
I'm counting on you, Yor.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.210
So what happened, Sis?

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.580
Why didn't you tell me?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.590
I-It's because...

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.590
I-I forgot!

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.220
Huh?

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.300
Uh... Wha...?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.600
I forgot!

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.020
Wait, we talked with each other
on the phone the other day...

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.430
You said you had a partner,
so why didn't you...

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.600
Th-That's because...

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.400
I forgot that I forgot to tell you...

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.480
...about our marriage!

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.490
I guess it is what it is
if you say so.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.280
Sorry, Sis!

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.490
He bought that?!

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.490
The man lacked reasoning
when it came to his sister.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.710
Sheesh!
How careless can you be, Sis?

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.500
Is this a common thing
among the Briars...?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.500
Here's your meal.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.010
Tch... Don't just butt in
on our happy time, damn it.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.010
Wait...

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.090
If I keep on acting like a jerk,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.100
my sister might hate me.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.010
Even if it's just a formality...

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.730
Loid's cooking is so delicious, right?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.730
Hmph! Don't think you can buy me
with mere food, you bozo!

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.400
Oh, right.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.070
I brought a bottle of wine.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.110
Please take it.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.110
That's very kind of you.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.070
I'll make you drunk
and dig out your dirty secrets!

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.200
You can't drink this, Yor.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.490
I know.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.580
Too bad...

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.630
So where did you first meet each other?

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.630
At the boutique on Third Avenue.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.420
He was looking at me deliberately...

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.880
So I was like, "Whoa..."

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.090
Ah, well...
I was attracted by her looks, so...

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.090
Why'd you put it like that?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.010
He'd see through us with this topic.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.350
Need to change the subject.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.100
But we hit it off over the
course of so many dinners.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.100
When, and where were those?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.900
How many times?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.610
What's the restaurant?

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.610
How many dinners did you have
before you decided to hook up with her?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.110
What made you decide to marry her?

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.320
Um...

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.110
Why am I being interrogated like this?

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.870
How do you two call each other?

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.080
Huh?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.620
Well... I call her Yor...

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.700
Yor!

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.370
Even I wouldn't dare
to call her by her name!

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.540
D-Don't tell me you call
him "Loi-Loi" or "Lottie"...?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.330
Huh? What?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.210
Uooooghh! Lottie!!

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.760
Uooooghh! Damn it!!

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.420
Uooooghh!

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.930
I-I just normally call him Loid!

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.930
The man lacked reasoning
when (REDACTED).

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.180
Are you okay?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.430
Here, have some water.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.900
What did she like from this guy?!

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.280
He's just good at cooking...

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.990
Handsome, and also tall...

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.200
And he's also a considerate doctor...

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.700
He's just...

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.080
Damn it!

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.790
Calm down, Yuri!

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.210
The Briars really have a
drinking problem, huh?

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.460
By the way, you're a
diplomat, aren't you, Yuri?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.710
Change the subject...

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.800
I think it's a fine profession,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.720
and your sister is always
boasting snidely about it.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.590
Huh?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.970
I heard it from Mr. Dominic,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.890
but you went to Hugaria the other day?

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.930
Huh? Yeah...

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.730
It's just for work.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.890
But you're right.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.480
It was a beautiful town.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.770
I wish I could show it to you.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.270
There were a lot of cafes too.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.150
And also an old restaurant said to be
frequented by the Queen of Hugaria...

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.650
At the capital city Obuda?

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.280
There's also a lot of
nice restaurants there.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.410
I used to go there during my study.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.160
Huh...

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.000
I used to frequent Kalpatia too.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.790
The old man who owns the
restaurant makes the best stew...

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.500
I've eaten that too!

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.170
Oh...

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.760
So this wine is from Hugaria, huh?

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.920
What a nice gift.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.880
This wine...

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.930
Oh, that wine...

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.180
...must be bought at a store
on Hedger Street.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.180
I happened to find that at
a specialist store on Hedger Street...

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.180
Must be expensive, right?

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.890
It's 200 dalc.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.690
No, it's only around 200 dalc.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.690
I knew it.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.190
It's really high quality.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.690
Thank you.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.360
This Q&amp;amp;A dialogue...

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.200
It's one of the forged stories written
in Ostania's intelligence agency manual.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.200
A template for when an agent
is visiting another country.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.960
In other words, what he's
saying is an obvious lie.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.460
Not to mention, the owner has
already handed the restaurant to his son.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.510
This wine has also seen an increase
in price to 300 dalc due to poor harvest.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.510
Even if he could fool
an amateur with that,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.720
he could never fool the Twilight.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.720
Yuri Briar.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.810
I already took precautions when I heard
that he's from the Foreign Ministry.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.230
Because that ministry is
like an entrance to espionage.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.770
According to what
Franky found about him,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.530
it was only until a year ago that
he was actually working at the ministry.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.610
He must've been recruited into the
intelligence agency before or after that.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.990
Judging from the fragments
of information so far,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.830
he must be working for Ostania's
counterintelligence agency,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.580
which is WISE's natural enemy,
the Secret Police.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.000
But... while it might be dangerous,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.370
as long as he's not suspicious
of my true identity,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.750
it won't hurt maintaining
a relationship with him.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.000
If I can pull this off,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.800
I might actually turn him into my
source of information on the enemy.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.760
I'll send you something
in return next time.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.340
Good thing you've got yourself
a nice brother-in-law, Yuri!

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.260
Looks like he's hiding his
true identity from Yor too.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.890
It might actually not
be difficult to rein him.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.770
Yuri...?

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.810
I told you, I still haven't
approved of your marriage!

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.320
Who would want to
consider him a brother-in-law?!

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.490
That's rude of you, Yuri!

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.030
It's exactly as you said.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.450
I could become
a fully-fledged working man...

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.490
...and buy expensive wines now.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.040
But it's all thanks to my sister!

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.750
We lost our parents, and we were poor,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.370
so I could never get my hands
on studying utensils.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.420
But...

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.210
Sis is sure late...

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.380
I wonder if she's still
not done with work.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.260
I'm home, Yuri!

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.510
Sis?!

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.800
You're covered in blood!
What happened?!

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.760
What kind of work were you doing?!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.020
Hm? Oh, I'm fine.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.520
It's just my target's splattered blood.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.270
Anyway, take a look at this!

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.310
Ta-da!

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.020
The complete visual
dictionary you'd always wanted!

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.070
I got a lot of money from
my work, so I bought this!

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.780
Ah, Sis...

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.610
Ta-da!

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.900
- Here are the snacks you'd always wanted!
- She always work her fingers to the bone

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.780
- Come on, you don't have to work anymore!
- just for my sake...

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.120
So I'd decided.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.290
That I should be a fully-fledged
member of society and protect her, fast.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.300
To protect the only family
I have forever...

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.010
Do you understand?

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.800
How I feel when some stranger
took away my precious family like that?

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.310
Yuri...

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.720
Well, yeah, I did hope...

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.810
...that she'd marry someone
and be happy with him.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.310
But that guy has to be able to
protect her more than I can!

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.900
Can you take on that role, Lottie?!

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.320
Lo...?

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.620
I just... want to reassure
my brother, that's all.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.620
I'll have you know...

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.620
...that my love for
Yor is as big as yours.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.000
My daughter also loves Yor so much.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.130
Wait, wait!
This is just an act to fool my brother!

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.340
She's already part of my family.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.130
Even if it's raining spears,
or raining meteors,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.310
I'll risk my life to protect her.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.890
The man was a brazen liar.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.100
Meteors?!

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.020
I could easily block off
a rain of spears...

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.400
But meteors...?!

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.820
Is he actually really amazing?!

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.570
But how?!

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.030
Say all you want, you liar!

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.410
Right! You have a liar's face on you!

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.660
Oh, Sheesh...

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.620
He's always been
careless since he was a kid...

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.410
- I have a liar's face?

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.290
- Oh, it's okay, Yor.
- I have a liar's face?

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:08.780
- Oh, it's okay, Yor.
- He saw right through me?

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.660
- Let me clean it up.
- He saw right through me?

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:09.990
- Let me clean it up.
- No, that's not possible.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.000
- No, that's not possible.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.590
Huh?
You've already been married for a year,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.430
but you flinched at
touching each other's hands...?

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.840
Huh? Are you guys really a couple?

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.010
What are you talking about?

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.560
We're as lovey-dovey as always.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.230
H-He's right!

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.600
Strange...

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.190
If you two are really married,
then prove it to me.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.610
We do have
our proof of marriage, though...

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.690
Not that!

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.820
You two should kiss
right here, and right now.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.200
Huh?!

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.280
It's an easy thing for
a loving couple to do, right?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.450
But... We can't do it in
front of someone else...

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.160
Just do it once.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.870
Then I'll be convinced.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.750
If you can't, I'll file a complaint
to revoke your marriage certification!

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.710
This is getting out of hand.
What do I do now?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.750
Wait, think this through, me.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.960
I'm Twilight, the best spy in Westalis.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.420
I've had romantic affairs with
numerous women for my mission.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.760
A kiss or two won't be a problem
if it means my mission can proceed!

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.800
If you're okay with it, then...

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.760
Huh?!

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.560
Wait, Loid!

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.310
We'll just do it as usual.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.020
Come on now.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.310
I know it's to convince him...

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.020
But...

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.530
Huh?!

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.620
Huuuuuhh?!

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.040
Fighting with each other

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.380
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.780
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.290
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.160
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.430
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.800
I met you

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.490
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.490
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.940
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.070
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:17.620
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.300
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.280
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.420
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.160
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.980
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.710
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.420
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.180
Any and every day is

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.750
A comedy with you

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.590
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.660
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:58.480
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.840
