00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.230
If you two are really married,
then prove it to me.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.240
You two should kiss
right here, and right now.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.270
If you're okay with it, then...

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.240
Huh?!

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.490
A kiss?!

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.010
He's about to kiss me?!

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.060
Is that... Uh...

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.900
Oh, right!

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.880
I read in a book that
a first kiss tastes like lemon!

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.250
It definitely goes well
with this marinade!

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.600
Wait, calm down, Yor!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.260
Get a grip already!

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.220
Here I go.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.010
W-W-W-Wait a second!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.580
I can't do this while being sober!

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.080
Thanks for waiting...

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.690
Huh? Y-Yeah, sure...

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.890
No need to force yourself
if you don't want to...

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.160
No, this is for my sake as well.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.080
I'll do my best.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.030
What are you muttering about?!

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880
Can you do it, or can't you?!

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.500
Prove it to me that you both
are a real couple!

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.940
Silence, Yuri.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.710
We'll show off how in
love we are to you now.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590
Here I go, Darling.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.340
Close your eyes now, come on.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.970
S-Sis!

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.960
Y-Yor...

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.990
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.880
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.990
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.680
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.500
On the template of happiness,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.050
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.450
We can't be as we are,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.820
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.120
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.830
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.110
they still don't disappear

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.650
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.590
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.800
And I know

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.320
Every day is so mediocre,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.930
but I'm here and so are you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.400
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.990
(Mission: 9 - Show Off How in Love You Are)

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.290
Sis...!

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.740
How indecent!

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.540
Sis!

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.550
Look! I ranked first at the exam!

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.300
Way to go!

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.770
Here's your reward kiss.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.350
Kiss!

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.810
Sis...

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.230
When I grow up...

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.450
I want to marry you!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.590
Oh, my!

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.220
Well, I guess I shouldn't get
married and wait for you, then!

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.820
Wait for you... Wait for you...

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.320
Y...

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.660
You can't do that, Sis!

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.340
I can't allow you to kiss
another guy in front of me...!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.250
At all!!

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.540
Oh, goodness...

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.960
I can't!

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.110
Noooo!!

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.300
Is it the end of the world?!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.360
Huh?! Y-Yuri?!

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.180
I get it, Sis...

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.370
I can't believe you rejected me so much
for trying to stop you from kissing him...

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.450
You really wanted to flirt
with him that much, huh?!

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.690
I was fool for trying to test you!

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.490
If anything, it's my feelings
that are being tested here!

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.380
Um... Anyway, you're bleeding...

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.470
Loid Forger.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.730
I'll let you have her lips for now!

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.390
Wh-What are you saying, Yuri?!

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.550
I'll let you off the hook for today.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.660
However!

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.350
Um... The blood...

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.230
Is this a normal thing among the Briars?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.150
Are you okay, Yuri?
You're staggering...

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.760
- And so are you, Yor...
- I'm good.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.410
Never mind me,
you're staggering as well, Sis.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.830
Should I call a taxi?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.260
No, I'm good.
You worry too much, Sis.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.850
What are you smirking about?!

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.190
Is my disgraceful behavior
that funny to you?!

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.140
Ah, well... I just thought you two
really are wonderful siblings.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.510
You've always supported
each other until now, right?

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.420
Yuri.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.390
Thank you for protecting Yor until now.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.460
I'm sure you've been through a lot.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.020
I'll do my best to support her as well,

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.830
so why don't both of us
make her happy together?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.330
Wh-Who would want
to borrow your hand?!

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.040
That's it! I'm out of here!

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.380
Please come again anytime.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.540
I'm sure Yor will love it.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.250
If possible, I'd like you to
meet our daughter too next time.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.220
Anya stayed up late to
wait for you earlier, you know!

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.430
She's so cute, so please play with her!

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.240
No need to tell me,
of course I'll come again!

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.820
Next time, I'll find proof that
you've been toying with my sister!

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.650
He's not toying with me!

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.720
Mark my words, Loid Forger.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.300
If you do anything that makes her cry,
I'll see to it myself that you'll be exe...

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.050
Uh...

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.290
You know... That...

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.170
Anyway, mark my words!

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.160
Be careful, okay!

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.660
And don't bother the
neighbors with your screaming!

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.390
Was he about to say "executed"?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.840
Gotta be careful.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.180
Is there a wiretap here...

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.220
Nope, all clear.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.940
Well, he's a Secret Police
member, or rather...

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.560
He's that kind of brother,
so he might do that.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.900
You can never be too careful.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.870
Thank you, Loid.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.640
Hm?

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.680
I'm ashamed to say this,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.620
but thank you for taking that
improper brother of mine as family.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.530
I see he really loves you, Yor.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.530
I don't really have any relatives aside
from my daughter that I can rely on.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.840
So I was kind of jealous of you two.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.210
Loid...

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.470
My daughter's also a fake, though.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.980
All in all,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.720
good thing he didn't find out
about our pretend family.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.770
Yes!

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.140
I feel so relieved,
I'm starting to get sleepy now.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.540
Let's go to bed after cleaning up.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.440
Of course, we'll sleep in separate beds!

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.380
I'll change them back!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.650
S-Sure...

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.570
Father...

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.820
Save the world...

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.180
Yuri... don't hit Loid,
or I'll get angry...

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.200
When was the last time
I envied others, I wonder?

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.080
Well, time to hit the hay.
I'm sure I'm just tired.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.350
My mission will still continue tomorrow.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.100
Excuse me!

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.110
Huh?

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.860
Whoa?!

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.070
Which way to the station?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.190
If anywhere, go to the hospital instead!

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.370
G'morbingh...

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.560
You look green today, Father.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.790
Stop being half-asleep and
wash your face already, kid.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.720
Good morning.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.960
Too bad you couldn't meet Yuri last night.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.270
Huh? Who's that?

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.440
Huh?! She was looking
forward to it so much, though...

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.480
It was a lively night yesterday, right?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.280
I'm sorry...

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.760
I never thought Yor's
brother could be like that...

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.990
Huh! Uncle!

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.990
And he's also a Secret Police member,
the enemy of spies, to top it off.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.270
S-Secret Police?!

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.120
What's that?

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.500
Secret... and police?

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.500
This sounds exciting!

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.060
Why didn't you introduce him to Anya?!
Give me back my excitement!

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.140
Did you really want to meet him so much?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.660
Well, the storm has passed for now.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.980
I should focus on
Anya's education for now.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.830
Come on, hurry up and
eat your breakfast, or you'll be late.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.900
We'll see him again soon.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.020
Is my concern really solved now?

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.450
Yor Briar has a brother that
belongs to the Secret Police.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.410
Yet I found nothing
suspicious about her person.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.950
She doesn't seem to be aware
of his brother's true identity either,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.460
and my hunch tells me that she's clean.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.620
If anything, if she knew that her
relative works at the Security Service,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.420
she wouldn't have to worry
about being single in the first place.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.780
No, it's dangerous to make an assumption.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.680
What if it all was just an act to
approach me from the beginning?

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.970
You should do well to
question everything, Twilight.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.480
Father...

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480
Mother...

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.600
Hm?

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.730
Mother's what?

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.230
Mother...

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.240
...sucks at cooking.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.430
You could tell
that I made today's breakfast?!

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I did my best, though...

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.280
Oh, Yor.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.130
Yes?

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.520
Ah... Um...

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.340
Maybe putting a wiretap
on her is going too far...

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.720
But I need to nip this anxiety in the bud.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.510
A moment's carelessness
can lead straight to death,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.100
and by extension, it can also affect
tens of thousands of people's lives.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.710
It's all to confirm Yor's innocence...

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.760
There's something on your collar.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.700
Huh?! Ah...

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.190
Thank you.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.520
That took me by surprise!

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.710
I thought he was going to
kiss me before going to work!

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.510
Wha?!

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.490
I-I still can't forget about
what happened last night...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.700
I can't even kiss him,
nor cook for him.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.490
While Loid did mend things last night...

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.500
I just couldn't act like
a proper wife for him.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.130
And I can somehow feel the
distance between him and me today.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.140
Maybe he's upset with me
for being such a disappointment.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.700
I need to be wary...

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.070
What's wrong, Anya?

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.200
Father and Mother must not fight.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.970
We're not fighting or anything, though?

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.550
H-He's right!

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.890
You be sure to befriend
your classmates too, okay?

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.940
Yep.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.650
We should get going too now.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:13.900
Okay.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.560
Kids are strangely sensitive at times.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960
Hey, Yuri.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.510
What's up with those wounds?

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.120
Didn't you go to celebrate
your sister's wedding last night...?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.210
I don't really remember much...

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.560
I bet you got drunk and
brawled with her husband, right?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.660
I told you to quit drinking.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.660
But I can't just let that
kind of guy be with her...

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.490
Was he a prick?

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:47.530
Nggh...

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.890
He was a good guy...

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.210
He was...

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.690
I think...

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.740
But spies and impostors
tend to pose as good guys!

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.480
Yeah, I hope he's really a spy!
Then I can put him to...

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.550
Calm down.
Do you even have proof of that?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.110
Oh, shoot!

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.060
I forgot to set up
a wiretap in the living room!

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.770
Wait, hold on!

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.690
If I were to hear Sis' voice
doing this and that with him,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.530
my heart wouldn't be able to take it!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.280
Did you inflict those wounds yourself?

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.790
You should get off your sister for
good so that you can focus on work.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.240
The mission to
capture the Western spies...

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.250
...especially Twilight, is ours to take.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.050
In turn, that will help
keep your sister safe.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.750
I know.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.000
For now...

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.610
Loid Forger...

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.510
When the day you make
Sis cry comes, I'll make sure that you...

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.380
What's up with her?

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.830
She said, "I'm a failure
as a wife..." or something.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.730
'Sup.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.000
Oh, Sharon.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.360
Huh?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.070
How to be a good wife, you ask?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.300
Are you having a fight with your husband?

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.550
No, it's not that...

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.480
It's just...

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.460
It's my first time having
a relationship with a man,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.830
so I just don't know
how to act properly...

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.160
I wondered about it too,
given her past relationships,

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.300
but she really has never
gone out with a man, huh.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.310
I just thought that
this can't go on forever...

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.550
I can't even cook at all, too...

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.540
What Anya said this morning
was a fatal blow...

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.400
Yor...

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.560
Is she trying to up her skill as a wife
to keep her cover from getting blown?

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.050
Hold on.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.310
I can't deny the possibility that she's
playing the perfect wife to deceive me.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.340
It's really a tragedy when your specs
are way below your husband's, huh!

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.450
Why don't you just divorce him?

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.650
I can't do that...

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:55.660
I feel like her relationships with her
co-workers are kind of... Hmm...

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.370
Hey, you two!
Stop talking and get to work already!

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.670
Ugh, Chief's here!

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.840
Oh, Yor.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.590
Sorry, but could you
send this out to the post office?

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.000
Understood.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.380
The only way to get a conclusive answer is
to do something about it myself, I guess.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.210
Come to think of it,
we have separate accounts, huh...

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.940
Would I be able to
help him as a proper wife...

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.240
...if we lumped together our earnings,
with mine being from my "work"?

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.830
But I can't have him get
suspicious about me...

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.830
Besides, we never talked about
supporting each other financially...

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.390
Hold it right there, Miss.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.210
We'd like to ask you something.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.220
Can we have a minute?

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.130
Th-The Secret Police?!

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.470
D-Did I do something wrong?

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.370
Were they suspicious of me...

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.950
...for looking at an ad for couples, though
I don't have the aura of a housewife?!

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.400
I-I-I'm a married woman!

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.860
We're not picking on you.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.650
Wait, what the heck's this?!

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.840
You suddenly called me to help you
interrogate your wife with this getup?!

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.090
Just shut up and do as planned.
It's for the mission.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.620
I have nothing to do
with your mission!

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.070
We are the ones censoring
the incoming mail to the post office.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.300
The sealed letter you just sent out...

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.250
...is suspected to be a cryptic
document addressed to the West.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.450
The sender is written as "Barnes".
Is he your superior?

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.880
Y-Yes.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.010
What's your name?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.330
Yor B...

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.220
Y-Yor Forger.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.020
Hm?

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.350
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just say Yor Forger?

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.290
Your name's clearly written here.
So you're saying you're an accomplice?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.780
He's really in the mood, huh?

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.200
So you were working as a group?

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.380
I don't know them!
This must be a misunderstanding!

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.660
It's better for you
if you just spit it out.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.680
We've apprehended a guy from the financial
department at the city hall too recently.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.490
So we're now sure that there's
a sizeable amount of internal corruption.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.490
I heard he got off so miserably!

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.670
He was tortured so harshly
that his mental was broken...

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.130
...and then
he committed suicide in prison!

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.290
Last month, we even
locked up a woman about his age!

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.080
You know, that parliamentary secretary...

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.120
What's up with his character setting?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.080
Well...

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.120
She was released because she had a
relative working for the Security Service.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.580
It's our privilege, right!

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.520
The families of Security Service members

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.980
usually get most of the charges
against them dropped!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.180
Anyway, we'll have you follow us
to the detention center now.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.350
If she knows that his brother
works for the Security Service...

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.790
She can just give out Yuri's
name and get away with it.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.210
There's no reason to
hide things from one's peers.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.620
If things go south,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.580
she'll just raise unnecessary suspicions
about me and my colleague here.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.460
Now, Yor...

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.090
If you're who I think you are,
you should ask for your brother's help.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.050
If not...

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.650
I...

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.980
I work every day for the sake
of the people living in this country.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.490
I swear I'm not involved
in any espionage act!

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.380
There's no point in
feigning innocence!

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.190
Just follow us to the de...

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.160
I already told you that
I'm a married woman.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.220
Please don't touch me so casually.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.220
You and your family won't
get off Scot-free if you do this.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.020
Both my brother and my husband...

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.690
They're good, kind-hearted citizens.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.670
If you try to harm them unjustly...

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.920
I will show no mercy...

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.920
Even against you two gentlemen!

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.680
Oh, Second Lieutenant Mop?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.860
Is this really the right cipher?

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.430
Huh? It can't be...

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.850
Wait a second!

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.080
Huh, this isn't a Raccoon cipher,
but a Caterpillar cipher!

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.060
After re-deciphering it,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.440
it appears to be a letter Mr. Barnes wrote
to a well-known haemorrhoid doctor.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.310
Huh?

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.640
Oh, I see...

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.860
He was so embarrassed,
he had to encrypt it, huh.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.410
What a perplexing guy.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.580
So it seems the espionage charge
against you was a mistake.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.220
Your name's not written in this document.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.790
You can go now, but don't tell this to
anyone to protect Mr. Barnes' honor.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.550
Man, what a farce.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.550
Well, judging from her behavior,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.680
I guess it's safe to say that
she's unrelated with the Secret Police.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.480
Hey, what's up?
Don't tell me you regret suspecting her?

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.440
It's not that.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.080
I already told you before, but that
unneeded affection won't get you anywhere.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.180
If you still want to live, trust no one.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.530
That's the only way
for people like us to survive.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.490
It's kind of annoying
when you say it with that face.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.550
Hey! That's the face you made, damn it!

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.790
I thought I could hook up
with some girls with that face!

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.510
My handsome face...!

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.600
You can't trick women into a relationship
with a forged face, my friend.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.970
Oh, how wise of you.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.580
Today was nothing but anxiety...

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.790
I was almost arrested, too...

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.750
Never mind being a good wife, I was this
close to disbanding the Forger family...

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.080
Oh, Yor?

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.360
Loid!

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.220
Fancy seeing you here.
Shall we go home together now, then?

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.960
Oh? There's something
on your collar again...

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.880
I'm sorry.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.520
I'm such a failure as a wife that
I can't even make myself look good...

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.930
From what I see, Yor...

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.460
Even in many families in the world,

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.490
every single one of them
"plays" a role and lives their life.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.720
Like, "This is how a wife should act",
or "It's because you're a parent".

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.890
Of course, it's also wonderful
to work hard in pursuit of an ideal.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.940
But...

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.890
Being too constrained by it
and losing sight of who you are...

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.400
...can make things go wrong.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.600
Even in the hospital where I'm working...

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.400
There are a lot of people suffering
from that coming there.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.980
You can get tired...

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.610
...from playing a forged role
the whole time.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.160
Loid...

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.860
So you just do you, Yor.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.870
If you keep an open mind, you'll be
surprisingly unnoticed by others.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.570
Anya will be happier as well...

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.520
...if you smile in front of her.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.280
Thank you.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.780
I...

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.680
I'm glad I married you, Loid!

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.160
Don't tell me you regret suspecting her?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.880
What did you just throw away?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.440
Oh, it was the dust
I picked up earlier from your collar.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:49.700
Anyway...

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.880
We didn't do anything on
our first wedding anniversary, right?

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.940
Let's go buy some cake on the way.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.340
Sure thing!

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.190
Father, Mother! Anya's back!

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.610
Welcome back, Anya!

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.730
What's up?

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:15.980
Father and Mother are friends again!

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.490
I told you, we're not
even fighting in the first place.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.870
We have a cake, Anya!

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.100
Cake! Sweet treat!

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.450
Hey, you're bothering
our neighbors downstairs.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.980
Fighting with each other

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.320
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.820
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.230
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.200
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.470
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.840
I met you

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.530
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.530
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:05.980
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.030
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:17.580
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.340
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.490
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.460
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.200
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.020
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.750
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.150
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.220
Any and every day is

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.790
A comedy with you

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.630
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.710
Rolling around in laughter

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:58.520
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.900
