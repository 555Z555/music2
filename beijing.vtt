Did you get scared?

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:51.423
What's so astonishing about it?

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.926
Where is the skull of the dinosaur?

00:02:57.217 --> 00:02:58.218
Where is it?

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:01.804
- Don't just stand there! Search!
- Yes.

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:03.263

Be careful!

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.929
Come on, be careful.

00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:15.473
Put the skull into the other container.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:17.558
Get ready and set out now!

00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:18.683
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:23.597
This is Yee calling, roger.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.931
Are you all right, Yee?

00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:26.974
The skull of the dinosaur is ready.

00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:29.059
All the thieves have been killed by me.

00:05:29.143 --> 00:05:31.102
- Report your location.
- I am currently at Ta Nien.

00:05:38.774 --> 00:05:41.858
How dare you kill off so many of my men?

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:47.362
Are you trying to kill me
with this toy gun?

00:05:47.862 --> 00:05:50.947
Kid, let me show you what a real gun is.

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:02.246
Curse you,
you just wasted one of my bullets.

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.872
What else will you show me?

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:29.137
Yee, report to us. What happened?

00:06:29.304 --> 00:06:31.221
- I am under attack.
- Who is attacking you?

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:33.765
I don't know,
he's wearing an indestructible armor.

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:38.643
And he has a golden gun.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.186
I have never seen such a powerful weapon!

00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:43.938
Send back up now!

00:06:54.777 --> 00:06:55.695
Yee!

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:57.571
Yee, what happened?

00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:00.739
Answer us, Yee!

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.245
Prime Minister.

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:16.082
Until now, we haven't gotten any clues
about the missing dinosaur's skull.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.375
However, the top spies of our organization

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:20.793
were almost killed.

00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:23.587
So we're facing some difficulties
in our investigation.

00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:26.505
The skull is a First-Grade Relic
of our country.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.506
- You have to get it back no matter what.
- Yes, sir!

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.883
- I will definitely try my best.
- Get it back as soon as possible.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:32.925
Yes.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:39.596
- Guards.
- Yes?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.638
What is that?

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:41.723
Sir.

00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:45.183
These files are over ten years old,
so we're going to burn them to ashes.

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:46.559
- Hold on.
- Yes.

CONFIDENTIAL
MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.188
Why is there a special file of our spies?

00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:56.232
This man is not qualified to be a spy.

00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:57.482
He is a backup.

00:07:58.441 --> 00:07:59.358
No.

00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:01.526
His ancestor was a hero.

00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:03.819
His background is clean,
and he can be trusted.

00:08:04.111 --> 00:08:05.903
Well, send this guy
to take on this mission.

00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.363

00:10:24.446 --> 00:10:25.905
- Let me have a look.
- Okay.

00:10:28.657 --> 00:10:29.574
Excuse me.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.746
Do you think it's safe
for you to hide here?

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:40.747
It's useless.

00:10:40.914 --> 00:10:42.540
You're a very attractive man.

00:10:42.623 --> 00:10:43.874
No matter where you hide,

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:48.085
you are always obvious and outstanding,
just like the fireflies in the dark.

00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:51.170
Your melancholic look,

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:53.296
your short beard,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.256
your great skill in chopping,

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:59.425
and your glass of dry martini,

00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:01.760
all of these will eventually
expose your identity.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.845
Even though you are so wonderful,

00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:08.180
we have our own rules too.

00:11:08.598 --> 00:11:10.682
You have to pay for my service last night.

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:12.475
Why didn't you pay after sleeping with me?

00:11:12.558 --> 00:11:15.643
I thought our relationship
was based on love.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:18.979
I never expected it
to be merely a business.

00:11:19.854 --> 00:11:21.480
Even if it's love, you still have to pay.

00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:22.397
I understand.

00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:24.107
If I had money, I would have paid you.

00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:27.359
My business has been kind of slow lately.

00:11:27.525 --> 00:11:28.610
How about this?

00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:31.277
Take this pork as payment instead.

00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:33.654
Here, just take it. Thank you.

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.155
What the heck? Just you wait!

00:11:36.698 --> 00:11:38.949
If you are in the mood,
how about we meet again tonight?

00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:44.327
It's your loss, not mine.

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.580
What? That butcher won't pay up?

00:11:48.663 --> 00:11:50.789
- Let me teach him a lesson.
- Forget it.

00:11:50.873 --> 00:11:51.915
After all,

00:11:52.915 --> 00:11:57.210
he is a very special and handsome butcher.

00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:09.509
"My strength could pull mountains,
my spirit pales the world."

00:12:12.844 --> 00:12:15.638
"Yet, so unlucky am I
that my horse just refuses to gallop!"

00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:16.889
Chat?

00:12:19.223 --> 00:12:20.224
Man-si?

00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:23.851
I wish for you to say
my full name, Da Man-si.

00:12:24.184 --> 00:12:26.353
- No problem, Man-si.
- Thank you.

00:12:26.436 --> 00:12:27.603
You're welcome, Man-si.

00:12:27.686 --> 00:12:29.187
We have a mission for you.

00:12:30.397 --> 00:12:31.689
- Really?
- Yes.

00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:35.108
They haven't forgotten me!

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.324
How are you, Rose?

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:51.034
We haven't met for ten years,
but you are still a beauty.

00:12:51.368 --> 00:12:53.077
I am not Rose.

00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:54.828
She died last year.

00:12:55.162 --> 00:12:56.496
I am her daughter, Rosy.

00:12:57.997 --> 00:12:59.330
- She has a daughter.
- Yes.

00:12:59.415 --> 00:13:01.082
Here, let me hug you.

00:13:01.874 --> 00:13:03.000
That can wait.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:04.918
Commander has been waiting for you.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.377
You may go in now.

00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:10.004
- All right, I will be back soon.
- Okay.

00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:16.091
Take this liver and make some soup.

00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:17.676
It's good for your health.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.178
You haven't been back for ages.

00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:24.095
Did you forget about the glass door there?

00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:39.147
Commander!

00:13:40.522 --> 00:13:42.065
- Ling Ling-chat, you're here.
- Yes.

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:44.692
No smoking.

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:49.903
No weapons are allowed either.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.571
Hey! Sorry.

00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:53.488
I won't give it to you
because I'm a swordsman.

00:13:53.572 --> 00:13:54.406
It's fine.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.199
"Swordsman"?

00:13:58.325 --> 00:14:00.743
I have waited for ten years,
I thought I was forgotten by the country.

00:14:00.827 --> 00:14:01.660
Of course not.

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:04.579
Even a piece of toilet paper
is useful for us.

00:14:04.662 --> 00:14:05.871
I like this analogy.

00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:08.289
I am well prepared for any kind of work.

00:14:08.706 --> 00:14:09.582
All right.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:13.334
I am glad that you can help us
at the right moment.

00:14:14.335 --> 00:14:17.545
Recently, we discovered
the biggest fossil of an ancient dinosaur.

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:19.963
- Go!
- But its skull was stolen.

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:24.049
In fact, the thief is a mysterious case.

00:14:25.758 --> 00:14:27.801
The only tip we have gotten so far

00:14:27.884 --> 00:14:29.469
is that he uses an invincible golden gun

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.846
and wears an indestructible armor.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.681
Given that this invaluable treasure is

00:14:35.806 --> 00:14:37.390
suspected to have been stolen
by Lai Yau-wai,

00:14:37.474 --> 00:14:39.225
the King of Smuggling in Hong Kong,

00:14:39.308 --> 00:14:41.434
you'll be sent to Hong Kong
to further investigate this case.

00:14:41.517 --> 00:14:43.060
Have you seen Rassic Park?

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:44.644
No, but I watched Jurassic Park.

00:14:44.728 --> 00:14:45.729
That's right, Jurassic Park.

00:14:45.812 --> 00:14:47.688
What kind of dinosaur was it?

00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:49.856
Is it the one that screamed?

00:14:50.565 --> 00:14:52.566
Right, the one that screamed like this.

00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:54.817
That one was so cruel
as it loved eating kids.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.694
- No, the one in China wouldn't eat kids.
- I guess you're right.

00:14:57.944 --> 00:15:00.571
Da Man-si, who trained you ten years ago,

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:01.946
will be the one supporting you.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.030
Hey, Man-si.

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:07.783
Commander, I'm Da Man-si.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.951
Man-si, how is it going?

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:13.286
I invented several new gadgets
and I hope they will help.

00:15:14.704 --> 00:15:15.622
A flashlight?

00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:18.331
No, this is not a common flashlight.

00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:21.208
It doesn't need batteries
as it is solar-powered.

00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:23.376
When there is light, it will light up.

00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:24.918
But if there is no light...

00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:26.378
No, never!

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.963
But will it still light up
even if there's no light?

00:15:29.046 --> 00:15:29.921
Good question.

00:15:30.088 --> 00:15:31.214
Turn off the light.

00:15:31.422 --> 00:15:32.257
All right.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:36.885
Just light it with another flashlight,

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:38.218
then it will light up.

00:15:38.594 --> 00:15:39.594
See?

00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:41.220
Doesn't it work?

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.846
- Turn on the light.
- Yes.

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:45.265
This invention is really creative.

00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:48.141
Look at that guard.

00:15:48.933 --> 00:15:50.768
Let's pretend that he's the man
with the golden gun.

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:13.990
This is called Super Spy's Chair.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.950
This is for you to keep watch
of your enemies for a long duration.

00:16:18.285 --> 00:16:19.952
Are you scared or not?

00:16:22.328 --> 00:16:23.829
See, you're scared.

00:16:23.913 --> 00:16:24.997
Right?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.166
- This is a powerful invention.
- Not bad.

00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:31.918
Right now,
I'm trying to make a superweapon,

00:16:32.084 --> 00:16:33.960
which includes
ten kinds of killing weapons.

00:16:34.044 --> 00:16:35.836
- If this is successfully made...
- Man-si.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:38.797
Let's talk in my office.

00:16:39.588 --> 00:16:42.424
Chat, have you been working
as a butcher for the past ten years?

00:16:42.507 --> 00:16:44.425
To be exact, a sad butcher.

00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:46.427
I am a sad vegetable hawker.

00:16:46.593 --> 00:16:51.095
Luckily, I have a part-time job at
the Central Psychological Research Centre.

00:16:51.262 --> 00:16:53.097
- What's your job?
- To be researched on.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:56.933
Not bad.

00:16:59.142 --> 00:17:00.726
Ling Ling-chat, remember this.

00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:03.645
The dinosaur's skull
represents the esteem of our country.

00:17:03.812 --> 00:17:06.314
It is not allowed
to be in the hands of foreigners.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.356
Throughout the investigation,
you have to keep your identity a secret.

00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:13.234
The man with the golden gun
is extremely mysterious

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:15.402
and very cruel.

00:17:16.027 --> 00:17:17.946
You will be in great danger.

00:17:18.154 --> 00:17:20.238
Ling Ling-chat, do you have any questions?

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.239
- May I be excused?
- You can't.

00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:24.365
You have to set out tomorrow morning.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.992
Once you reach Hong Kong,
someone will contact you.

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:28.618
Understood.

00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:29.994
- Is there anything else?
- No.

00:17:32.287 --> 00:17:34.330
I'll personally give you 200 yuan.

00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:36.790
Buy yourself better clothes
before you go off to Hong Kong.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.833
Don't tarnish the image of our country.

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:40.334
- Man-si.
- Yes.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.668
Buy me a cup of tea.

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:46.129
- Remember to take back the change.
- Yes.

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:50.131
Man-si, Commander,
I'll try my best for my country.

00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:51.716
Good speech, good pal!

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:53.925
- Good pal, good speech!
- Good!

00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.557
Are you crazy?

00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:07.350
Are you really sending a butcher
to look for the dinosaur?

00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:11.936
He was a very good spy.

00:18:12.144 --> 00:18:13.062
"Good"?

00:18:13.562 --> 00:18:14.896
Are you taking me for a fool?

00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:16.814
He hasn't been a spy for ages.

00:18:16.939 --> 00:18:18.607
Does he still know how to shoot?

00:18:20.441 --> 00:18:22.192
Deputy Captain, don't worry.

00:18:25.444 --> 00:18:28.446
I sent him for this mission
because I know his ability very well.

00:18:29.989 --> 00:18:31.781
Of course, you do.

00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:34.367
Only you know what's in your mind.

00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:40.078
In my opinion,
since the skull was stolen in Shenyang,

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.787
it should be taken care of
by the Northerns.

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:46.665
To put it simply, you don't trust me.

00:18:46.749 --> 00:18:48.708
That's right, I don't.

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:51.043
I have already sent my people
to investigate this case.

00:18:51.168 --> 00:18:53.003
I'll definitely catch the man
who stole the skull.

00:18:54.129 --> 00:18:56.130
Well, we don't have much to talk about.

00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:58.589
Please leave.

00:19:31.234 --> 00:19:33.443
This man is gone for good now.

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:36.404
Go to Hong Kong now.

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:39.281
Send this document to a man
called Ling Ling-chat.

00:19:39.822 --> 00:19:41.282
Find a chance to kill him.

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:52.289

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SPY'S GUIDE

00:20:48.906 --> 00:20:52.741
HAVE DREAMS, BE CIVILIZED, BE ORGANIZED

00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:50.193
I have booked a room.

00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:51.861
What's your name?

00:21:57.906 --> 00:22:00.282
Sorry, your name isn't listed here.

00:22:00.532 --> 00:22:01.492
What?

00:22:01.575 --> 00:22:02.575
Really?

00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:04.744
Please check again.

00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:09.747
Sorry, your booking
is not for Regent Hotel,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.414
but it's for Regent Motel.

00:22:29.008 --> 00:22:31.968
Sir, since you are so good looking,

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:33.469
I will only charge you 70 dollars a day.

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.095
The check out time is at 12 p.m.

00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:37.805
What?

00:22:44.601 --> 00:22:45.434
Here.

00:22:46.102 --> 00:22:47.770
If you wear this, it will be better.

00:22:47.853 --> 00:22:48.728
Really?

00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:55.190
How is it? Okay?

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.109
- Yes, but this doesn't fit me.
- Do you want any hookers?

00:22:59.193 --> 00:23:00.693
Good idea, what kind of girls do you have?

00:23:00.778 --> 00:23:02.904
Mainlanders or local girls,
only 150 dollars each.

00:23:04.613 --> 00:23:06.031
- I would like a local.
- All right.

00:23:06.989 --> 00:23:08.990
- Madam, what are you doing?
- I'm taking off your trousers.

00:23:09.074 --> 00:23:10.992
- Why are you doing this?
- You want a local girl, right?

00:23:11.075 --> 00:23:12.410
I am famous in this area.

00:23:26.418 --> 00:23:31.462
MEET YOU AT TRIANGLE PARK
WITH A RED ROSE AS A SIGN

00:23:50.474 --> 00:23:51.599
It's you!

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:56.852
So?

00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:58.270
Are you being tailed?

00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:01.147
Come and eat, hurry up.

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:02.273
Hurry.

00:24:03.565 --> 00:24:05.858
Come on, eat.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.419
There are so many pretty girls
in Hong Kong.

00:24:42.922 --> 00:24:44.423
You are so kindhearted.

00:24:44.965 --> 00:24:46.424
Do you always feed the dogs?

00:24:48.383 --> 00:24:49.468
Do you love painting?

00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:50.719
Yes, how about you?

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.261
I don't like it.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.804
I am just a butcher.

00:24:59.057 --> 00:25:00.100
What is that song?

00:25:02.517 --> 00:25:03.602
"Li Heung-lan."

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.769
By Jacky Cheung?

00:25:05.978 --> 00:25:07.520
I know it, but I'm not familiar with it.

00:25:08.355 --> 00:25:09.855
I know Li Heung-kam better.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.856
Really?

00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:12.648
My name is Li Heung-kam.

00:25:12.857 --> 00:25:15.400
- Is your name Li Heung-kam?
- Yes, I am Li Heung-kam.

00:25:17.943 --> 00:25:19.361
You're Li Heung-kam.

00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:22.988
So Li Heung-lan must be your mom.

00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:25.531
Yes, she is my mom.

00:25:29.117 --> 00:25:30.951
Li Heung-lan is your mom.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.162
- Do you smoke?
- No.

00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:37.497
Come out.

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:40.374
Come out!

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.960
Why is there a cigarette butt?

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:46.418
The door is not even fully closed.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:48.670
Obviously, there's someone hiding
inside the closet.

00:25:49.087 --> 00:25:50.296
Step aside, it's really dangerous.

00:25:50.546 --> 00:25:51.506
Come out!

00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:56.759
Do you smoke Kent?

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.635
How do you know that?

00:25:59.051 --> 00:26:00.344
You were the one who threw this.

00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:05.722
Come on, wear your shoes.

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:12.059
After a very long journey,

00:26:12.143 --> 00:26:14.602
I am a bit nervous.

00:26:14.853 --> 00:26:16.271
But I can say this without hesitation.

00:26:16.354 --> 00:26:18.230
I really am a great spy.

00:26:18.772 --> 00:26:20.189
Please return the slippers to me.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.315
Here.

00:26:23.316 --> 00:26:26.735
I'm very well-prepared for this mission.

00:26:29.486 --> 00:26:30.404
Look.

00:26:30.487 --> 00:26:32.196
For example, this is the model F40.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.906
It looks like a normal mobile phone,

00:26:33.989 --> 00:26:36.408
but do you see this platinum layer here?

00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:37.408
In fact,

00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:39.284
this is a shaver.

00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:44.245
It helps us to shave
without being noticed by others.

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.373
This is the 911 model
and it looks like a shaver.

00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:50.457
However,

00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:53.459
it's actually a hairdryer.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.212
Do you really need so many hairdryers?

00:26:59.254 --> 00:27:00.922
This is only a cover.

00:27:01.006 --> 00:27:02.089
Actually,

00:27:04.257 --> 00:27:05.341
this is a shaver.

00:27:06.342 --> 00:27:07.301
See?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.719
I guess that's why you're so handsome.

00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:12.137
You're flattering me.

00:27:13.346 --> 00:27:16.390
If you lose this hairdryer,
what will you do?

00:27:16.557 --> 00:27:17.473
What a simple question.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:18.891
I am a wise guy.

00:27:19.725 --> 00:27:21.268
In fact, my shoes...

00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:24.270
are also hairdryers.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.899
You know, being a spy,
one's appearance is very important.

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:36.610
I'm sorry, but do you have any batteries?

00:27:38.028 --> 00:27:39.446
It's out of battery.

00:27:40.237 --> 00:27:41.072
No.

00:27:41.905 --> 00:27:44.240
Forget it, I will handle it later.

00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:51.619
I wish to know
that being an excellent spy,

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.745
what kind of gun do you use?

00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:54.038
Can you show me?

00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:56.372
What a shame.

00:27:56.581 --> 00:27:58.332
I don't know much about guns.

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:01.334
I am good with daggers instead.

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:02.960
"Daggers"?

00:28:04.544 --> 00:28:07.546
Right, a dagger.

00:28:07.629 --> 00:28:09.672
D, A, G, G, E, R.

00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:48.946
So amazing.

00:28:49.654 --> 00:28:51.030
- In fact...
- I get it.

00:28:51.114 --> 00:28:52.448
Why don't we get back to our topic?

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:59.327
As a spy, you have to have
knowledge about guns.

00:28:59.785 --> 00:29:02.912
This is called UFO Rifle
and it's suitable for long-range shooting.

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:03.997
The range is 200 meters.

00:29:04.288 --> 00:29:07.915
This is a 224 tiny spittoon bullet
and especially made by me.

00:29:08.708 --> 00:29:09.958
I love its name.

00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:11.918
- A 357 Magnum.
- So great!

00:29:12.002 --> 00:29:13.586
It comes with a set of steel shot bullets.

00:29:13.753 --> 00:29:15.462
Can it kill a dinosaur?

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.213
You would have to try it
with a real dinosaur.

00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:24.675
This is PPK made in China
and it is used by mainland spies.

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:25.926
Its range is 120 meters.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.636
Even though it can be loud,

00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:29.428
with this silencer,

00:29:29.512 --> 00:29:31.554
you can kill without producing any noise.

00:29:39.684 --> 00:29:42.353
What is it that is stuck inside?

00:29:44.271 --> 00:29:45.938
Perhaps a piece of cotton?

00:29:47.148 --> 00:29:48.732
Is it that simple?

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.983
Don't you think it's toilet paper?

00:29:53.568 --> 00:29:55.403
You are so handsome and funny.

00:29:57.487 --> 00:29:58.821
I can't see anything inside.

00:30:03.824 --> 00:30:04.866
Well, it's cute.

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:08.035
Does this fit?

00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:12.288
Mine fits too.

00:30:12.913 --> 00:30:14.122
May I try?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.791
All right, but how?

00:30:17.124 --> 00:30:19.417
It's raining now,
so let me close the windows first.

00:30:32.966 --> 00:30:33.884
What happened?

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:35.218
Why are you shot?

00:30:35.552 --> 00:30:39.429
- I was trying to test this gun.
- But this gun shoots from the back!

00:30:39.512 --> 00:30:41.847
- Why didn't you inform me earlier?
- Wait, you're bleeding.

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:52.312
What did you do?

00:30:52.728 --> 00:30:54.647
- I was testing the gun again.
- Again?

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.315
Why didn't you ask me before testing?
This gun is called the Nicked Gun.

00:30:57.398 --> 00:31:00.108
It first shoots from the back,
then switches to the front.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:02.068
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:31:02.276 --> 00:31:04.945
You're bleeding,
you should cover the wounds first.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.416
Kam, why are you sweating?

00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:28.875
I just took a bath.

00:31:29.375 --> 00:31:30.626
Where is Ling Ling-chat?

00:31:30.918 --> 00:31:33.795
He is still here, but don't worry,
I will finish my mission soon.

00:31:33.878 --> 00:31:35.504
- No, the plan has changed.
- What?

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.298
Kill him in Lai Yau-wai's house.

00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:41.175
So that we can set him up

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.801
and no one would suspect anything.

00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:45.635
- Wait for one more day.
- What?

00:31:45.844 --> 00:31:47.011
"One more day"?

00:31:47.637 --> 00:31:49.722
Wait, why are you bleeding?

00:31:50.888 --> 00:31:53.182
Nothing, I just brushed my teeth
and this blood is from the gums.

00:31:53.307 --> 00:31:55.558
What kind of toothbrush are you using?
A broom?

00:31:56.934 --> 00:31:57.893
How are you?

00:31:59.478 --> 00:32:01.020
Hi, Ling Ling-chat.

00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:05.647
Commander,
I am glad to see you in the toilet.

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.149
How is your partnership going along?

00:32:08.608 --> 00:32:11.193
Not bad, Kam is nice.

00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:12.318
She is a good friend of mine.

00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:14.278
Kam, what do you think about me?

00:32:14.487 --> 00:32:16.404
Other than your good looks,
I have nothing else to say.

00:32:16.488 --> 00:32:18.030
You'll find out
I'm good at other things too.

00:32:18.114 --> 00:32:20.198
I hope you will complete the mission soon.

00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:21.241
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:29.496
Kam, take back your gun first.

00:32:30.537 --> 00:32:31.538
Thank you.

00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:33.539
Don't move, let me help you.

00:32:33.623 --> 00:32:35.457
Save it for yourself.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.875
I am fine, thank you.

00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:39.877
Listen, never test out the guns alone.

00:32:42.837 --> 00:32:45.088
I love it, what's wrong with that?

00:32:53.551 --> 00:32:54.927
- Waiter.
- Yes?

00:32:55.261 --> 00:32:57.304
I have heard that
the tofu pudding is famous here.

00:32:57.388 --> 00:32:58.889
- Yes.
- It stinks.

00:32:58.972 --> 00:33:00.264
It is famous for its stench.

00:33:00.723 --> 00:33:03.766
Can you bring me something
which is famous for its taste?

00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:06.059
- That will be our tofu pudding.
- Is that true?

00:33:06.143 --> 00:33:06.976
It is.

00:33:07.227 --> 00:33:09.853
Just imagine that this is stinky tofu
and you will find it delicious.

00:33:13.522 --> 00:33:15.273
- Give me some deep-fried ones.
- All right.

00:33:18.108 --> 00:33:20.151
Hong Kong shopping centers
are so wonderful.

00:33:20.234 --> 00:33:21.110
They are.

00:33:22.736 --> 00:33:24.070
How are your wounds?

00:33:24.862 --> 00:33:25.988
It's no big deal.

00:33:27.031 --> 00:33:28.782
Don't ever test out the guns
you don't know about.

00:33:30.073 --> 00:33:31.783
I should have learned
using dagger from you.

00:33:31.949 --> 00:33:35.118
I'm not qualified to be your teacher,
but let me tell you this.

00:33:35.702 --> 00:33:37.912
A real dagger is not controlled
with your hands.

00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:39.371
Try to guess what it is.

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:41.205
It's air.

00:33:42.248 --> 00:33:44.249
Use the air to govern your dagger.

00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:47.793
When you do that,
you can cut through anything in the world.

00:33:50.586 --> 00:33:51.503
If you don't believe me,

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:54.130
- I'll show you with this knife.
- All right, let's just eat.

00:33:55.088 --> 00:33:57.840
Kam, are you still mad at me?

00:33:59.258 --> 00:34:00.301
Don't be silly.

00:34:00.384 --> 00:34:01.634
What made you think that I'm not?

00:34:01.717 --> 00:34:03.135
I am very mad at you.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.303
Are you kidding?

00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:05.304
How angry are you?

00:34:08.472 --> 00:34:10.390
I would like to shoot you to death.

00:34:13.517 --> 00:34:14.642
Why are you taking our picture?

00:34:14.725 --> 00:34:16.060
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.

00:34:16.143 --> 00:34:18.019
I am actually an artist.

00:34:18.102 --> 00:34:20.146
I am trying to find
some inspiration about love.

00:34:20.229 --> 00:34:23.523
From your eyes,
I can tell that you two are lovers,

00:34:23.606 --> 00:34:25.774
so I couldn't help but take a picture.

00:34:25.857 --> 00:34:26.983
I hope you don't mind.

00:34:44.493 --> 00:34:46.119
You can have that photo.

00:34:47.037 --> 00:34:48.621
I'll keep this one, thank you.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.872
Thank you.

00:34:52.373 --> 00:34:53.833
Don't even bother, just take it.

00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:02.838
Sir.

00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:04.089
Did you just spit this out?

00:35:04.172 --> 00:35:05.965
Yes, is there anything wrong?

00:35:06.048 --> 00:35:08.383
It's nothing, I just wanted to know.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.635
From your accent,
are you perhaps from Hunan?

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.095
Yes, I am.

00:35:13.386 --> 00:35:14.636
I came from Hunan too!

00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:15.721
Which district are you from?

00:35:15.804 --> 00:35:18.514
- Cho Tao Town, Dongting Lake.
- Me too!

00:35:18.931 --> 00:35:20.807
What a coincidence! Which village?

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:22.016
Shang Yang Village.

00:35:22.725 --> 00:35:24.893
It really is a coincidence,
we're from Shang Yang Village too.

00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:27.519
- Is that so?
- Who knows we'd meet our neighbor here?

00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:28.645
Excuse me.

00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:33.023
There was a dog that always barked
near the entrance of our village.

00:35:33.107 --> 00:35:34.523
I adopted that dog,

00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:36.484
but it somehow disappeared.

00:35:36.859 --> 00:35:38.985
Then I found out that it was eaten.

00:35:39.068 --> 00:35:43.321
That heartless guy dumped its bones
at the entrance of the village.

00:35:43.488 --> 00:35:46.365
Were you perhaps the one
who did such a cruel thing?

00:35:47.198 --> 00:35:48.199
No, I didn't do it.

00:35:48.574 --> 00:35:50.658
- Then why are your cheeks red?
- No, they're not.

00:35:51.284 --> 00:35:54.202
- Your smile looks so awkward.
- It's not awkward.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:56.412
- I have a feeling it was done by you.
- No!

00:35:56.496 --> 00:35:58.372
- Were you the one who did it?
- No, it wasn't me!

00:35:58.455 --> 00:36:00.248
- Was it really not you?
- I didn't do it!

00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.957
- It wasn't me!
- Are you sure?

00:36:02.165 --> 00:36:04.250
- Thank you for the meal.
- It's no big deal.

00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:07.335
- Don't mention it, it's just a meal.
- Thank you.

00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:11.505
After all, us Hunan people
can't be looked down on.

00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:15.298
When we go back to our hometown,
we will be rich and famous.

00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.134
I won't bother you then.

00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:22.427
If we meet again,
I will treat you to breakfast.

00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:23.470
See you soon.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.346
Hey, wait up.

00:36:29.266 --> 00:36:30.224
How about this?

00:36:30.307 --> 00:36:32.893
We should wait for two of my friends
who are picking up something.

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:35.019
They will return soon.
How about we shop around together?

00:36:35.102 --> 00:36:37.311
- Thank you, but we have something to do.
- It's okay.

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.813
It's hard to meet your neighbors,
you should have a chat.

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:41.023
I need to go to the restroom.

00:36:41.106 --> 00:36:42.064
Fine.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.869
Listen, I'll only say this once!

00:37:04.578 --> 00:37:05.662
Do you get it?

00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:20.254
You're so handsome
compared to other Hunan people.

00:37:24.632 --> 00:37:27.801
I know that you care
about your appearance a lot.

00:37:29.302 --> 00:37:31.386
If you lose the hat,
you'll look more handsome.

00:37:32.136 --> 00:37:33.930
Don't wear hats so often.

00:37:34.388 --> 00:37:36.472
In fact, I loved wearing hats.

00:37:36.556 --> 00:37:39.183
But someone told me
that hats make our hair feel stuffy,

00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:41.184
so if you keep wearing them,
you will easily go bald.

00:37:41.684 --> 00:37:42.935
Why is it taking so long?

00:37:43.018 --> 00:37:45.227
Aren't they supposed
to only grab something?

00:37:47.479 --> 00:37:48.396
Hey.

00:37:51.065 --> 00:37:52.482
What's wrong, son?

00:37:52.774 --> 00:37:53.858
Are you still angry with me?

00:37:54.317 --> 00:37:57.277
You've always been the one tricking me,
yet I only tricked you once.

00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:02.613
All right, I'll buy you some popcorn.

00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.406
- Really? Let's go!
- Yes.

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:06.865
- You tricked me again!
- I'm going to beat you!

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.244
It hurts.

00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:19.332
I told you not to shout.

00:38:29.004 --> 00:38:30.171
Hey, there they are.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.678
We're the police, freeze!

00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:53.220
Don't move!

00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:55.136
We're neighbors, so you have to help me.

00:38:56.136 --> 00:38:57.011
Come here.

00:38:57.095 --> 00:38:58.095
Go to hell!

00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:01.970
Are you okay?

00:39:02.178 --> 00:39:03.470
Calling!

00:39:03.553 --> 00:39:05.511
Send in an ambulance right now,
many people are shot.

00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:07.386
We're on the fourth floor
of Royal Castle, over.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.886
- Go away!
- Get lost!

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.803
- Move or I'll shoot you!
- Get lost!

00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:16.928
I will shoot!

00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:18.845
Move or I'll shoot you!

00:39:19.011 --> 00:39:21.178
- Go away!
- Don't come over!

00:39:23.553 --> 00:39:25.511
- Tak!
- Don't come close!

00:39:25.761 --> 00:39:26.845
Don't come close!

00:39:26.928 --> 00:39:28.303
- Don't come over!
- I will shoot him!

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.761
- Give me back my son, I beg you.
- Get lost!

00:39:30.845 --> 00:39:32.928
- He's my everything!
- Get lost!

00:39:33.011 --> 00:39:35.303
Give me back my son!

00:39:35.636 --> 00:39:38.928
- Please give my son back!
- Get lost!

00:39:39.053 --> 00:39:40.886
- Just give his son back.
- Give me back my son!

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.511
- No!
- My son!

00:39:58.136 --> 00:39:59.428
- Watch him.
- Okay.

00:39:59.636 --> 00:40:00.928
We have taken control of this place.

00:40:01.053 --> 00:40:01.928
Come with me!

00:40:02.553 --> 00:40:03.428
Freeze!

00:40:16.761 --> 00:40:17.928
- Let's go!
- Okay!

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.178
Hung, hurry up!

00:40:37.303 --> 00:40:39.511
Hung, come here quickly!

00:40:44.345 --> 00:40:45.470
Hung!

00:41:15.094 --> 00:41:18.094
- Hurry up!
- Faster, leave now!

00:41:18.802 --> 00:41:20.135
They're coming down, be careful!

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:37.260
Is this vaudeville?

00:41:46.594 --> 00:41:49.594
I thought I could kill
with someone's hand,

00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:52.260
but the plan failed.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:54.010
Didn't you receive an order from me?

00:41:54.802 --> 00:41:56.594
How could you make your own decision?

00:41:56.802 --> 00:41:57.760
I know,

00:41:58.344 --> 00:42:01.677
but I really want to find out who he is.

00:42:01.802 --> 00:42:02.719
Shut it!

00:42:03.302 --> 00:42:05.010
Who do you think you are
to ask me this question?

00:42:05.594 --> 00:42:07.344
You are in no position to know who he is.

00:42:08.344 --> 00:42:09.260
Remember this.

00:42:09.802 --> 00:42:12.135
Both your mom and dad were traitors!

00:42:12.219 --> 00:42:13.427
Your grandfather too was one,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.552
which makes you a traitor!

00:42:15.635 --> 00:42:17.635
It's fate!

00:42:17.885 --> 00:42:19.427
If I had not adopted you,

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:21.802
you would have been executed with them!

00:42:22.635 --> 00:42:24.219
Your life is mine.

00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:26.177
So you're going to obey my order.

00:42:26.594 --> 00:42:27.719
Is that clear?

00:42:31.677 --> 00:42:32.635
Kam.

00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:36.302
I know that you're a kindhearted person.

00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:39.302
Do you know what he is?

00:42:40.427 --> 00:42:41.760
He's a beast.

00:42:42.635 --> 00:42:44.635
In fact, he's a nasty guy.

00:42:44.885 --> 00:42:48.469
He assaulted pregnant women
and molested little girls.

00:42:49.844 --> 00:42:52.177
Here, look at how small
these little girls were

00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:55.177
and how large the stomachs
of these pregnant women.

00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:57.219
All of them were hurt by Chat.

00:42:57.302 --> 00:42:59.302
You're not only helping me,

00:42:59.802 --> 00:43:01.510
but also the public.

00:43:01.802 --> 00:43:03.510
- Any questions?
- No.

00:43:03.844 --> 00:43:04.802
Good.

00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:06.594
Tomorrow, just do it as planned.

00:43:06.885 --> 00:43:08.469
Kill him in Lai Yau-wai's house.

00:43:08.594 --> 00:43:09.510
Understood.

00:43:22.844 --> 00:43:25.052
- Are you all alright?
- What's the matter?

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.094
It's nothing.

00:43:26.344 --> 00:43:28.010
You have been inside for quite a long time

00:43:28.094 --> 00:43:29.594
and you didn't answer me.

00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:31.302
That's why I broke in.

00:43:33.094 --> 00:43:34.760
- Are you taking a bath?
- Yes.

00:43:34.844 --> 00:43:36.677
I'm fine, so please close the door.

00:43:37.094 --> 00:43:37.969
All right.

00:43:41.344 --> 00:43:43.094
I can't believe what happened today...

00:43:43.177 --> 00:43:45.760
I mean you should get out
and close the door.

00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:51.302
Get out!

00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:56.302
What do you want?

00:43:56.385 --> 00:43:57.760
- Do you want to do it?
- What is it?

00:43:57.885 --> 00:43:59.552
- Give money to the deceased's family.
- Who?

00:43:59.635 --> 00:44:01.302
- Tak's dad.
- Who is Tak's dad?

00:44:01.385 --> 00:44:03.719
The innocent victim who was shot dead
at the shopping center today.

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:06.052
Donating money to the deceased's family?

00:44:06.135 --> 00:44:08.552
Would it be okay if we ask the press
to give Tak's family the money?

00:44:08.635 --> 00:44:09.635
I guess so.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.927
What name should we write?
The kindhearted guys?

00:44:12.427 --> 00:44:13.469
It's up to you.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.760
Since we're not close friends,

00:44:15.844 --> 00:44:17.760
500 dollars should be enough, right?

00:44:18.469 --> 00:44:19.427
You should decide.

00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:22.094
- Can you pay the 500 dollars for me?
- What did you just say?

00:44:22.302 --> 00:44:24.760
Once I'm finished with this mission,
I'll be rewarded with 500 dollars.

00:44:24.844 --> 00:44:26.135
- I can pay you back later.
- What?

00:44:26.469 --> 00:44:28.927
Trust me, I won't forget my words.

00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:32.719
All right.

00:45:27.009 --> 00:45:28.509
Put it down.

00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:30.759
More.

00:45:32.468 --> 00:45:33.509
More.

00:45:33.968 --> 00:45:35.551
That's it, okay.

00:45:36.259 --> 00:45:38.134
All of these are dangerous explosives.

00:45:38.509 --> 00:45:40.593
You have to send people
to be on watch all around the clock.

00:45:40.676 --> 00:45:41.551
- Roger!
- Roger!

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.593
Lai Yau-wai always deals with smuggling.

00:45:56.968 --> 00:45:59.051
The lost cranium of dinosaur
might be related to him.

00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:00.301
This is him.

00:46:00.509 --> 00:46:01.759
Take action when there's a chance.

00:46:01.843 --> 00:46:03.676
- Do you have any questions?
- Yes.

00:46:04.759 --> 00:46:06.676
Is Lee Heung-lan your mom?

00:46:06.926 --> 00:46:09.426
As per my knowledge, she was a traitor.

00:46:12.551 --> 00:46:13.718
Sorry, I have no questions left.

00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:15.301
Time's up, let's go.

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:19.634
Kam, if we finish the mission tonight,
I'll return to China at once.

00:46:19.718 --> 00:46:21.676
So tell me what you like
and I'll give it to you.

00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:22.718
No, thank you.

00:46:22.801 --> 00:46:24.551
- I insist.
- Then, white roses.

00:46:27.093 --> 00:46:28.426
Maybe, I'll give them to you instead.

00:46:32.426 --> 00:46:34.051
If we have the time,

00:46:34.343 --> 00:46:36.509
I would like to visit
the karaoke of Hong Kong.

00:46:36.718 --> 00:46:38.218
I'll keep in contact with you.

00:46:39.509 --> 00:46:42.801
You know, my voice is like Jacky Cheung.

00:46:42.884 --> 00:46:44.509
My Adam's apple can move up and down.

00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:46.843
Here's the key to the rear door.
Hurry, or you'll have no time.

00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:48.551
I'll sing you a song.

00:46:48.634 --> 00:46:50.134
I'll sing "Lee Heung-lan."

00:46:50.384 --> 00:46:51.426
Listen!

00:46:51.634 --> 00:46:53.259
I'm forced to stay with you.

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.759
Don't ever mention Lee Heung-Ian
or sing songs in front of me!

00:46:55.843 --> 00:46:57.634
I don't want to hear your rubbish!

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:03.426
I appreciate how straightforward you are.

00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.843
This key is not necessary.

00:47:08.343 --> 00:47:10.593
This box is not a simple box.

00:47:10.676 --> 00:47:12.634
It's a special box called Magic Box.

00:47:12.718 --> 00:47:15.551
It can send me to Lai's house
safely and gracefully.

00:47:18.093 --> 00:47:23.301
Magic Box!

00:47:27.426 --> 00:47:28.801
Why are you here? What do you want?

00:47:29.051 --> 00:47:31.218
I should be the one asking that question!

00:47:33.051 --> 00:47:35.051
I haven't adjusted the angle,
so the direction was wrong.

00:47:36.134 --> 00:47:37.009
Now, it's ready.

00:47:39.593 --> 00:47:40.718
Magic...

00:47:40.801 --> 00:47:41.718
Damn it!

00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:47.093
The door is open.

00:47:47.176 --> 00:47:48.134
Go in.

00:47:49.801 --> 00:47:51.593
Kam, I am not a fool...

00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:53.551
- Clean the blood first.
- All right.

00:47:55.134 --> 00:47:57.259
I think this box is wrongly positioned.

00:47:57.343 --> 00:47:58.509
Just adjust it and it'll be fine.

00:48:01.093 --> 00:48:02.968
- Don't waste my time!
- It'll be fine.

00:48:03.051 --> 00:48:04.009
Give me one more chance.

00:48:05.718 --> 00:48:10.426
Magic Box!

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:25.259
A dry martini, please.

00:48:34.593 --> 00:48:36.843
What are you looking at?
Give me another glass.

00:48:37.676 --> 00:48:40.259
What the heck was that?

00:48:45.093 --> 00:48:46.593
Chat, how is it going?

00:48:47.634 --> 00:48:48.509
Dangerous.

00:48:48.593 --> 00:48:51.926
The guests are all very fierce
yet kind at the same time.

00:48:52.009 --> 00:48:53.634
You won't believe it.

00:48:55.384 --> 00:48:56.634
Sir, how about you?

00:48:56.968 --> 00:48:58.509
I can do it myself, thank you.

00:49:11.384 --> 00:49:12.676
Mr. Lai, a call.

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.426
Hello?

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.300
Target discovered.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.675
Pay attention, the skull...

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.758
Listen, I'll only say this one more time.

00:49:50.175 --> 00:49:53.800
Put the bones into hot water
to remove extra fats.

00:49:53.883 --> 00:49:56.425
Next, boil it with fish maw for an hour.

00:49:56.508 --> 00:49:58.217
- When will you come back for the soup?
- Enough.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.008
Stop calling me.

00:50:00.092 --> 00:50:01.550
My wife is still here.

00:50:02.008 --> 00:50:03.592
Romario passed it to Pai Bi-to.

00:50:03.675 --> 00:50:06.758
Pai Bi-to scored with his wonderful skill!

00:50:10.633 --> 00:50:12.717
Chat, how is it? Can you hear anything?

00:50:15.633 --> 00:50:18.217
I believe that a man
called Pai Bi-to stole the skull.

00:50:18.508 --> 00:50:22.008
He then used his amazing skills
to shoot and score a point.

00:50:22.175 --> 00:50:23.800
But the signal is weak here.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.758
I'm planning to dig a tunnel
towards his sofa

00:50:26.842 --> 00:50:28.217
and hear what he is talking about.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.217
Chat, cut the crap.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.258
Go somewhere else
that has a better signal.

00:50:34.758 --> 00:50:36.467
There's radio interference everywhere.

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:39.300
I can't hear what Lai Yau-wai is saying.

00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:43.633
Chat.

00:50:43.717 --> 00:50:45.883
Try to find a place that is not crowded.

00:50:47.883 --> 00:50:49.675
There's a piano in front of me
and it's not crowded.

00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:55.883
Go ahead and try.

00:50:56.675 --> 00:50:57.633
All right.

00:51:08.508 --> 00:51:09.883
It's still not clear.

00:51:10.217 --> 00:51:12.550
Don't move, just sit still.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.633
That's perfect.

00:51:17.633 --> 00:51:20.092
I feel embarrassed
to be sitting here alone.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:22.217
You love singing, right?

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.425
You should sing.

00:51:24.383 --> 00:51:25.342
All right.

00:51:57.092 --> 00:51:58.383
I forgot the lyrics.

00:52:55.633 --> 00:52:57.217
How was it?

00:52:57.883 --> 00:52:58.842
It was so-so.

00:52:59.258 --> 00:53:00.592
Just say anything.

00:53:00.883 --> 00:53:02.008
Your tune was a little off.

00:53:14.175 --> 00:53:15.758
You were really great.

00:53:21.133 --> 00:53:23.383
You're amazing to have changed position
in such a short time.

00:53:23.467 --> 00:53:25.675
I guess you're really something.

00:53:25.925 --> 00:53:27.300
Just to be frank,

00:53:28.092 --> 00:53:30.425
I'm waiting for a very important man here.

00:53:30.842 --> 00:53:32.842
I believe you know him too.

00:53:35.717 --> 00:53:38.258
Sorry, no comment.

00:53:39.133 --> 00:53:40.842
I won't force you,

00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:43.674
but I have something to tell you.

00:53:44.507 --> 00:53:45.924
I really like you.

00:55:00.299 --> 00:55:02.882
Kam, do you copy?
It's very dangerous here.

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.716
I don't know where the killers are hiding.

00:55:23.757 --> 00:55:25.341
What a golden opportunity.

00:56:05.841 --> 00:56:06.882
I was shot.

00:56:09.424 --> 00:56:11.049
How did you manage to walk then?

00:56:12.382 --> 00:56:13.841
Luckily, I put on a bulletproof vest.

00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:16.799
However,
there isn't any bulletproof trousers.

00:56:24.257 --> 00:56:25.216
This is for you.

00:56:26.632 --> 00:56:28.382
Where did you find them?

00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:30.216
I got it while I was escaping.

00:56:30.716 --> 00:56:32.924
This is rare, you're really lucky.

00:56:44.716 --> 00:56:47.174
Don't be so serious, you lunatic!

00:56:47.966 --> 00:56:49.091
How did you know that I am one?

00:56:49.174 --> 00:56:50.424
Many people told me that too.

00:56:50.757 --> 00:56:52.382
The killer with the golden gun
is still inside.

00:56:52.466 --> 00:56:54.216
For now, let's leave. Go!

00:56:55.841 --> 00:56:57.091
Hey!

00:56:58.466 --> 00:56:59.424
Who is he?

00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:09.632
I'm here, don't worry.

00:57:10.924 --> 00:57:12.632
You cripple, sit back
and let me handle this man!

00:57:21.674 --> 00:57:23.632
- Run over him!
- I'm going to do it!

00:57:32.841 --> 00:57:34.216
You're lucky to have escaped!

00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:53.716
Are you okay?

00:57:54.799 --> 00:57:57.382
Do you have a bandage,
cotton, and scissors?

00:58:05.506 --> 00:58:06.423
Yes.

00:58:19.173 --> 00:58:21.090
- I couldn't get any scissors!
- Forget it.

00:58:25.298 --> 00:58:27.215
The bullet is shot
right into the bone of my thigh

00:58:27.506 --> 00:58:28.965
and it's pressing upon my arteries,

00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:30.631
located near the trigeminal nerve.

00:58:32.048 --> 00:58:34.006
My left brain is lacking oxygen

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.090
and my body's right side
is starting to feel numb.

00:58:37.756 --> 00:58:40.298
I have to cut the wound
and take out the bullet.

00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:46.590
Let me do it.

00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:57.840
This is a legendary knife
which was made by a famous smith.

00:58:58.298 --> 00:59:00.215
It is made with a special iron.

00:59:00.423 --> 00:59:03.090
The total weight of this
is 25 kilograms and 113 grams.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.840
Ordinary people can't lift it up.

00:59:07.923 --> 00:59:09.256
This requires special skills.

00:59:09.715 --> 00:59:12.048
In order to not come in contact
with the nerves and vessels,

00:59:12.965 --> 00:59:15.131
- help me widen the wound.
- What?

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:16.506
Can you do that?

00:59:17.256 --> 00:59:18.298
Yes.

00:59:19.631 --> 00:59:20.881
Can you see the bullet?

00:59:21.798 --> 00:59:24.215
- Is it the black one?
- No, that's trash.

00:59:24.298 --> 00:59:25.423
Look carefully, higher.

00:59:26.506 --> 00:59:28.715
- The white one?
- Yes, that's the bone.

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.298
The bullet should be silver.

00:59:30.923 --> 00:59:32.631
I can see it now.
It is lodged deep inside.

00:59:36.423 --> 00:59:37.840
Dig it out.

00:59:38.006 --> 00:59:39.548
- Dig it out?
- Yes.

00:59:39.881 --> 00:59:41.006
Just like this?

00:59:41.298 --> 00:59:42.340
Just like that.

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:43.756
Don't you need anesthetic?

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:44.798
Yes.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:48.006
Play this video.

00:59:53.506 --> 00:59:55.173
- Did you give me the wrong tape?
- No.

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.965
This is called Shifting Attention Method.

00:59:58.256 --> 00:59:59.923
This is clearly a doggy style.

01:00:00.006 --> 01:00:01.131
Do you think that I'm an idiot?

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:03.173
I mean this is my anesthetic.

01:00:03.506 --> 01:00:06.548
Have you read the story of Hua Tuo,
the greatest doctor of China?

01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:11.798
Guan Yunchang played chess
to distract himself from pain.

01:00:12.465 --> 01:00:16.423
Now, I'm going to watch this sex tape
to distract myself from pain too.

01:00:16.798 --> 01:00:17.631
Go ahead.

01:00:19.965 --> 01:00:22.090
- You can watch it later.
- All right.

01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:33.965
The bullet is too close to the bone
and there are nerves around it.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:36.006
- It will be very painful, so hold it.
- Look at that man.

01:00:43.423 --> 01:00:44.506
Why did you stop?

01:00:46.673 --> 01:00:49.131
I want my blood
to concentrate on one part.

01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:50.506
I don't want to lose much blood.

01:00:50.756 --> 01:00:52.173
Forget it, just continue.

01:00:52.673 --> 01:00:54.006
It's blocking my view.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.256
Why don't you move it aside?

01:00:59.506 --> 01:01:01.756
Use more force.

01:01:01.923 --> 01:01:03.590
What? Too much force?

01:01:04.006 --> 01:01:05.048
I wasn't talking to you.

01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:06.631
I was talking to the man in the video.

01:01:09.256 --> 01:01:10.381
There's so much blood.

01:01:11.673 --> 01:01:13.381
You broke a vessel.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:14.423
What should I do?

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.423
Keep watching the video.

01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:33.798
Can you hold it?

01:01:35.423 --> 01:01:37.840
Talk to me, ask me some questions.

01:01:38.215 --> 01:01:39.715
Don't let me fall asleep.

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:42.173
I'm afraid I won't wake up
if I were to fall asleep.

01:01:44.881 --> 01:01:46.131
What's your name?

01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:47.923
I am called Ling Ling-chat.

01:01:48.631 --> 01:01:50.215
You may ask some difficult questions.

01:01:51.548 --> 01:01:52.506
Difficult?

01:01:53.756 --> 01:01:54.923
There is a farm,

01:01:55.298 --> 01:01:57.215
the number of chickens
is four times the ducks.

01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:59.840
And there are nine ducks less
than the pigs.

01:01:59.923 --> 01:02:02.465
The sum of both pigs and ducks is 67.

01:02:02.631 --> 01:02:06.006
How many legs do the animals
on the farm have?

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.298
Let me ask you.

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:10.006
All right.

01:02:13.881 --> 01:02:16.130
Who are the man and woman
in that painting?

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.255
My parents.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.089
Why can't I see their faces?

01:02:25.047 --> 01:02:27.005
They died when I was small.

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:28.505
So I don't have much memory of them.

01:02:31.755 --> 01:02:33.297
Both of us are orphans.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.380
That's why we can befriend each other.

01:02:36.505 --> 01:02:37.380
Kam.

01:02:40.547 --> 01:02:41.589
Thank you.

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.839
Don't mention it.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.589
Hang on, don't die.

01:02:51.922 --> 01:02:53.589
Can you turn off the air conditioner?

01:02:53.714 --> 01:02:54.797
I feel cold.

01:03:57.755 --> 01:03:58.672
Chat.

01:04:01.714 --> 01:04:02.714
Chat.

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:04.547
Chat!

01:04:06.089 --> 01:04:07.339
I'm lucky...

01:04:10.922 --> 01:04:12.547
This method works every time.

01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:16.172
Especially if you want to disinfect
and stop the bleeding.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.880
A 224 tiny spittoon bullet?

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.297
It is only used by you.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.005
Where is your UFO Rifle?

01:04:48.089 --> 01:04:49.714
Don't tell me it is in your car outside?

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:59.422
You were the one who shot me, right?

01:05:12.589 --> 01:05:14.047
Why did you save me then?

01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:21.339
What is your relationship
with the man with the golden gun?

01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:23.047
Don't ask, I won't tell you anything.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.089
I am a spy, but I couldn't kill you.

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:26.339
That can only mean one thing.

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:27.505
Go on.

01:05:39.505 --> 01:05:40.380
All right.

01:05:47.547 --> 01:05:49.339
I couldn't make it
even in such a short distance.

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:52.130
What a poor aim.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.297
I can't help it.

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.589
Don't bother me anymore
about killing and fighting.

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:05.172
I rather watch porn videos.

01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:19.005
Just pretend that I have never met you.

01:06:40.546 --> 01:06:41.463
Chat?

01:06:41.879 --> 01:06:44.421
Chat, don't go! You can't go back!

01:06:44.629 --> 01:06:46.213
Commander is the man with the golden gun.

01:06:46.296 --> 01:06:47.588
The dinosaur's...

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:50.754
Why are you taller?

01:06:52.254 --> 01:06:54.254
You finally told the truth.

01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:01.754
You look thinner now.

01:07:02.088 --> 01:07:05.046
It's not easy to be a traitor, right?

01:07:15.046 --> 01:07:17.296
Miss, do you have a Band-Aid?

01:07:17.379 --> 01:07:19.588
You're so cute.

01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:22.296
No wonder Deputy Captain
was killed by you.

01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:24.463
I want to see your commander.

01:07:24.629 --> 01:07:26.421
Please show us the way.

01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:41.421
HAVE DREAMS, BE CIVILIZED, BE ORGANIZED

01:07:42.629 --> 01:07:45.629
Did you know that
Kam betrayed our country?

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:48.879
I didn't know.

01:07:49.213 --> 01:07:51.713
Our country trusted her so much,
yet she...

01:07:51.963 --> 01:07:53.338
Who shot you?

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:55.338
I believe it was done
by the man with the golden gun.

01:07:55.546 --> 01:07:57.088
Where is Kam? Where is she?

01:07:57.171 --> 01:07:59.296
- I don't know. She is missing.
- Goodness.

01:08:00.379 --> 01:08:01.213
So careless.

01:08:01.296 --> 01:08:04.213
The enemy is too cunning
that they appear everywhere.

01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:05.379
Hey.

01:08:05.463 --> 01:08:07.046
How is your wound?

01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.171
- It will be all right.
- But you're bleeding.

01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:11.838
Here, sign this.

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:13.879
Then you should go to the hospital
for treatment.

01:08:14.338 --> 01:08:15.421
It's urgent.

01:08:15.504 --> 01:08:18.046
- Guard, send him to the hospital.
- Yes!

01:08:18.129 --> 01:08:19.921
You don't have to worry much.

01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:22.504
This way, please.

01:08:51.713 --> 01:08:53.296
What are you looking at? Hurry up.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.588
We have been waiting for you.

01:08:55.129 --> 01:08:56.463
Why is there an execution going on?

01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:59.296
- Hey, let's go the other way.
- There's no need. We have arrived.

01:09:02.879 --> 01:09:03.713
Hey.

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:05.046
What are you doing?

01:09:05.838 --> 01:09:06.838
It's heavy.

01:09:07.171 --> 01:09:10.254
What's the matter?

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:13.004
- It's nothing.
- What do you mean, "Nothing"?

01:09:13.088 --> 01:09:14.963
I have a problem with it. Hey!

01:09:15.338 --> 01:09:16.296
Don't move.

01:09:17.129 --> 01:09:19.171
- If there's anything, you should tell me.
- All right.

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:20.754
Ling Ling-chat.

01:09:20.838 --> 01:09:23.879
You signed and admitted
that you're a traitor.

01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:26.713
As you stole our country's treasure,
you deserve capital punishment.

01:09:26.921 --> 01:09:28.421
You'll be executed now!

01:09:32.838 --> 01:09:33.671
Go back!

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.754
- Wait, I'm innocent!
- Wait, I'm innocent!

01:09:37.921 --> 01:09:39.629
I didn't see
any national confidentialities.

01:09:39.963 --> 01:09:42.546
You should have some conscience.

01:09:43.296 --> 01:09:45.213
Everyone knows that I'm blind.

01:09:46.129 --> 01:09:50.421
How dare you frame a blind man
in reading national confidentialities?

01:09:56.046 --> 01:09:58.171
Listen, I'm a good friend
of Commissioner Chan.

01:09:58.254 --> 01:09:59.379
I always have meals with him.

01:09:59.463 --> 01:10:00.671
Wait!

01:10:00.754 --> 01:10:03.171
- Wait!
- Wait.

01:10:03.796 --> 01:10:05.504
- My dad is Commissioner Chan!
- That's true.

01:10:05.588 --> 01:10:07.171
If you kill me, I'll ask him to kill you!

01:10:07.254 --> 01:10:08.129
Ready.

01:10:09.088 --> 01:10:11.004
Please!

01:10:11.088 --> 01:10:12.921
No!

01:10:15.421 --> 01:10:19.338
I'm so handsome!

01:10:19.463 --> 01:10:23.213
- I don't want this!
- I don't want to die!

01:10:28.338 --> 01:10:29.296
No!

01:10:36.088 --> 01:10:37.379
Damn it!

01:10:37.629 --> 01:10:38.963
What an ugly face!

01:10:40.296 --> 01:10:41.296
You're so ugly!

01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:45.379
Good shot!

01:10:51.878 --> 01:10:52.753
Next.

01:11:05.003 --> 01:11:08.795
My 30 years of practice
is finally useful now.

01:11:10.295 --> 01:11:11.128
Get ready.

01:11:15.128 --> 01:11:17.253
Do you want to kill
a martial arts hero like me?

01:11:17.378 --> 01:11:18.545
It won't be that easy!

01:11:46.837 --> 01:11:47.670
Ready.

01:11:54.753 --> 01:11:55.628
Execute him now!

01:12:00.878 --> 01:12:04.378
Take this container to the boundary
in 30 minutes.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.712
- The buyer is waiting.
- Understood.

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:09.337
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:12:16.878 --> 01:12:18.628
Your buyer has been killed off.

01:12:19.128 --> 01:12:21.337
Now, the skull is none of your business.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.253
We'll send it back to Shenyang ourselves.

01:12:25.253 --> 01:12:27.045
Surrender now,

01:12:27.503 --> 01:12:28.878
or all of you will be killed!

01:12:29.378 --> 01:12:30.503
The man with the golden gun,

01:12:30.837 --> 01:12:33.795
I have caught one of your subordinates.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.337
You better surrender now.

01:12:44.087 --> 01:12:46.462
What the heck?

01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:50.253
Are you even human?

01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:51.878
Luckily, I put on a bulletproof vest!

01:12:52.212 --> 01:12:55.545
I shouldn't have risked my life for you,
especially when you fired without telling?

01:12:55.753 --> 01:12:57.087
You wanted to shoot me, right?

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:58.087
Shoot him!

01:13:20.087 --> 01:13:21.920
An eye for an eye.

01:13:22.003 --> 01:13:23.170
I'll cooperate with you two.

01:13:23.378 --> 01:13:24.920
I know where he is, follow me.

01:13:27.378 --> 01:13:31.503
BE FAITHFUL TO OUR COUNTRY

01:13:57.128 --> 01:13:58.878
Come, I have been waiting for you.

01:13:58.962 --> 01:13:59.795
Be careful!

01:14:06.128 --> 01:14:07.962
I can shoot you to death this time!

01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:30.503
Stop staring!

01:14:30.587 --> 01:14:31.795
Show him what we have.

01:14:36.462 --> 01:14:38.003
High-Temperature Flame!

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:42.337
I don't think your armor
can stand my High-Temperature Flame!

01:14:45.712 --> 01:14:47.087
Gosh, I'm sorry.

01:14:47.212 --> 01:14:49.087
I used up the gas last night.

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:50.712
I'm sorry for not informing you.

01:14:50.795 --> 01:14:52.712
- I'm really sorry.
- What?

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:00.962
Are you playing around with me?
I'll blow you up!

01:15:01.045 --> 01:15:02.420
It's your turn now!

01:15:04.253 --> 01:15:05.878
Don't forget me!

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:10.294
Wonder Fist!

01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:44.794
I shouldn't have provided you
with a good living.

01:15:44.961 --> 01:15:48.127
You betrayed me for a butcher!

01:15:52.794 --> 01:15:55.877
Ling Ling-chat was just killed.

01:15:56.377 --> 01:15:57.336
Since you love him so much,

01:15:57.711 --> 01:15:59.794
I'll send you to hell with him then!

01:16:02.211 --> 01:16:03.127
Chat!

01:16:08.294 --> 01:16:10.252
I know your trick!

01:16:12.461 --> 01:16:14.336
If you do,
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:16.211
Ling Ling-chat!

01:16:16.502 --> 01:16:17.919
Chat, are you okay?

01:16:18.002 --> 01:16:20.711
I'm fine,
but please don't say anything cheesy.

01:16:21.086 --> 01:16:22.794
Weren't you supposed to be executed?

01:16:23.252 --> 01:16:24.711
I get so mad thinking about it.

01:16:24.794 --> 01:16:26.294
You made me lose a hundred dollars!

01:16:44.502 --> 01:16:45.377
Leave now.

01:16:47.877 --> 01:16:49.211
Here.

01:16:53.252 --> 01:16:54.752
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

01:16:58.211 --> 01:17:00.627
A bad boss garners bad underlings.

01:17:00.836 --> 01:17:02.711
Your fellows are far greedier than you!

01:17:02.877 --> 01:17:04.169
What a shame that you are standing

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.419
in front of the words,
"Be faithful to our country."

01:17:06.711 --> 01:17:08.711
If you, a revolting force of evil,
still exists in China,

01:17:08.794 --> 01:17:10.836
our people won't have better lives.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:13.252
I have to kill you right now!

01:17:13.794 --> 01:17:15.336
You trash, do you think you can kill me?

01:17:15.419 --> 01:17:16.586
"Trash"?

01:17:17.627 --> 01:17:21.086
I used up all my days
to invent this superweapon,

01:17:21.252 --> 01:17:23.086
Killing 3000.

01:17:23.169 --> 01:17:25.586
It is a combination of ten killing weapons

01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:26.919
and now, it is finally done!

01:17:27.002 --> 01:17:28.294
Chat, step aside.

01:17:28.419 --> 01:17:29.294
Farther.

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:30.919
Way farther!

01:17:31.627 --> 01:17:32.627
Really?

01:17:33.294 --> 01:17:35.002
I would love to see it.

01:17:35.086 --> 01:17:38.419
Killing 3000!

01:17:39.336 --> 01:17:40.211
Knife!

01:17:40.294 --> 01:17:41.336
Bicycle chain!

01:17:41.586 --> 01:17:42.461
Gun powder!

01:17:42.627 --> 01:17:44.086
Acid! Drugs!

01:17:44.169 --> 01:17:45.586
Gun! Grenade!

01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:46.544
Triangle sharpener!

01:17:46.627 --> 01:17:48.252
Each of them can easily kill you off!

01:17:48.336 --> 01:17:49.919
Now, they are combined
into one superweapon!

01:17:50.377 --> 01:17:51.752
Are you scared?

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:54.044
You crazy lunatic!

01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:56.002
- You should have been killed.
- Wait!

01:17:56.377 --> 01:17:57.377
Goodness!

01:18:00.002 --> 01:18:00.877
Man-si!

01:18:01.127 --> 01:18:03.377
Chat, you are our only hope.

01:18:10.169 --> 01:18:11.627
Well, I have no other choice.

01:18:13.711 --> 01:18:15.252
I have to fight alone!

01:18:18.919 --> 01:18:20.211
A butcher's knife?

01:18:31.002 --> 01:18:32.544
A butcher's knife!

01:18:54.252 --> 01:18:55.294
No!

01:19:29.418 --> 01:19:31.501
What the heck!

01:19:31.751 --> 01:19:33.168
Let me see how powerful you are.

01:19:33.418 --> 01:19:35.043
I will let you witness my power.

01:19:35.335 --> 01:19:36.668
Come on.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:19:59.210
What kind of a knife is that?

01:20:00.001 --> 01:20:01.043
A butcher's knife.

01:20:01.501 --> 01:20:02.751
It is used to kill beasts.

01:20:54.501 --> 01:20:56.460
Give me five dollars of pork, please.

01:21:00.168 --> 01:21:02.501
My stall is temporarily closed.
Come back an hour later.

01:21:02.793 --> 01:21:03.918
One hour?

01:21:04.001 --> 01:21:06.126
I don't think you can last
more than three minutes.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.668
I can last more than three hours.

01:21:08.335 --> 01:21:09.960
Chat, how about we do this
once we're home?

01:21:10.043 --> 01:21:12.085
Don't waste any time
and this place is nice.

01:21:12.293 --> 01:21:13.251
Just leave.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.460
Chat, we're in trouble!

01:21:23.918 --> 01:21:26.376
Our spy satellite is lost in space!

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.626
It is concerning the safety
of our country.

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:30.710
I have been newly promoted.

01:21:30.793 --> 01:21:32.626
You wouldn't want to get me
into any trouble, right?

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.293
Come back here and help me out.

01:21:35.001 --> 01:21:36.501
I'm currently busy with my girl.

01:21:36.585 --> 01:21:38.793
I couldn't care less
about the country right now, Man-si.

01:21:38.876 --> 01:21:41.001
Gosh, I have told you many times.

01:21:41.085 --> 01:21:43.751
My name is Da Man-si!

01:21:57.085 --> 01:22:01.835
HERO OF THE NATION,
FROM SIU PENG
