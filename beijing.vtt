Did you get scared?

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.375
What's so astonishing about it?

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:54.875
Where is the skull of the dinosaur?

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:56.166
Where is it?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.750
-Don't just stand there! Search!
-Yes.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:01.208

Be careful!

00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:09.833
Come on, be careful.

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:13.375
Put the skull into the other container.

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.458
Get ready and set out now!

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.583
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.458
This is Yee calling, roger.

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:22.791
Are you all right, Yee?

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:24.833
The skull of the dinosaur is ready.

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:26.916
All the thieves have been killed by me.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.958
-Report your location.
-I am currently at Ta Nien.

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.708
How dare you kill off so many of my men?

00:05:42.833 --> 00:05:45.208
Are you trying to kill me
with this toy gun?

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:48.791
Kid, let me show you what a real gun is.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.083
Curse you,
you just wasted one of my bullets.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.708
What else will you show me?

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:26.958
Yee, report to us. What happened?

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.041
-I am under attack.
-Who is attacking you?

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.583
I don't know,
he's wearing an indestructible armor.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.458
And he has a golden gun.

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.000
I have never seen such a powerful weapon!

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.750
Send back up now!

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:53.500
Yee!

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:55.375
Yee, what happened?

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:58.541
Answer us, Yee!

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:09.041
Prime Minister.

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:13.875
Until now, we haven't gotten any clues
about the missing dinosaur's skull.

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:17.166
However, the top spies of our organization

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.583
were almost killed.

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.375
So we're facing some difficulties
in our investigation.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.291
The skull is a First-Grade Relic
of our country.

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:26.291
-You have to get it back no matter what.
-Yes, sir!

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:29.666
-I will definitely try my best.
-Get it back as soon as possible.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.708
Yes.

00:07:36.375 --> 00:07:37.375
-Guards.
-Yes?

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:38.416
What is that?

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:39.500
Sir.

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:42.958
These files are over ten years old,
so we're going to burn them to ashes.

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:44.333
-Hold on.
-Yes.

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.958
Why is there a special file of our spies?

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:54.000
This man is not qualified to be a spy.

00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:55.250
He is a backup.

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.125
No.

00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.291
His ancestor was a hero.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.583
His background is clean,
and he can be trusted.

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.666
Well, send this guy
to take on this mission.

-Let me have a look.
-Okay.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:27.250
Excuse me.

00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:37.416
Do you think it's safe
for you to hide here?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.416
It's useless.

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.208
You're a very attractive man.

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.541
No matter where you hide,

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:45.750
you are always obvious and outstanding,
just like the fireflies in the dark.

00:10:47.416 --> 00:10:48.833
Your melancholic look,

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:50.958
your short beard,

00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.916
your great skill in chopping,

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:57.083
and your glass of dry martini,

00:10:57.541 --> 00:10:59.416
all of these will eventually
expose your identity.

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:02.500
Even though you are so wonderful,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.833
we have our own rules too.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.333
You have to pay for my service last night.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.125
Why didn't you pay after sleeping with me?

00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:13.291
I thought our relationship
was based on love.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.625
I never expected it
to be merely a business.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.125
Even if it's love, you still have to pay.

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.041
I understand.

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:21.750
If I had money, I would have paid you.

00:11:22.416 --> 00:11:25.000
My business has been kind of slow lately.

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:26.250
How about this?

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.916
Take this pork as payment instead.

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:31.291
Here, just take it. Thank you.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.791
What the heck? Just you wait!

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:36.583
If you are in the mood,
how about we meet again tonight?

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:41.958
It's your loss, not mine.

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:46.208
What? That butcher won't pay up?

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:48.416
-Let me teach him a lesson.
-Forget it.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.541
After all,

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:54.833
he is a very special and handsome butcher.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:07.125
"My strength could pull mountains,
my spirit pales the world."

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:13.250
"Yet, so unlucky am I
that my horse just refuses to gallop!"

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.500
Chat?

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:17.833
Man-si?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.458
I wish for you to say
my full name, Da Man-si.

00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:23.958
-No problem, Man-si.
-Thank you.

00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:25.208
You're welcome, Man-si.

00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:26.791
We have a mission for you.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.291
-Really?
-Yes.

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.708
They haven't forgotten me!

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:45.916
How are you, Rose?

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:48.625
We haven't met for ten years,
but you are still a beauty.

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.666
I am not Rose.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.416
She died last year.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.083
I am her daughter, Rosy.

00:12:55.583 --> 00:12:56.916
-She has a daughter.
-Yes.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.666
Here, let me hug you.

00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:00.583
That can wait.

00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:02.500
Commander has been waiting for you.

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:04.958
You may go in now.

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.583
-All right, I will be back soon.
-Okay.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.666
Take this liver and make some soup.

00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.250
It's good for your health.

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.750
You haven't been back for ages.

00:13:19.875 --> 00:13:21.666
Did you forget about the glass door there?

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:36.708
Commander!

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:39.625
-Ling Ling-chat, you're here.
-Yes.

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:42.250
No smoking.

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:47.458
No weapons are allowed either.

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.125
Hey! Sorry.

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:51.041
I won't give it to you
because I'm a swordsman.

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:51.958
It's fine.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:54.750
"Swordsman"?

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.291
I have waited for ten years,
I thought I was forgotten by the country.

00:13:58.375 --> 00:13:59.208
Of course not.

00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:02.125
Even a piece of toilet paper
is useful for us.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.416
I like this analogy.

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:05.833
I am well prepared for any kind of work.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.125
All right.

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:10.875
I am glad that you can help us
at the right moment.

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:15.083
Recently, we discovered
the biggest fossil of an ancient dinosaur.

00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:17.500
-Go!
-But its skull was stolen.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.583
In fact, the thief is a mysterious case.

00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:25.333
The only tip we have gotten so far

00:14:25.416 --> 00:14:27.000
is that he uses an invincible golden gun

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:30.375
and wears an indestructible armor.

00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.208
Given that this invaluable treasure is

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:34.916
suspected to have been stolen
by Lai Yau-wai,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.750
the King of Smuggling in Hong Kong,

00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.958
you'll be sent to Hong Kong
to further investigate this case.

00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:40.583
Have you seen Rassic Park?

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.166
No, but I watched Jurassic Park.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.250
That's right, Jurassic Park.

00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:45.208
What kind of dinosaur was it?

00:14:45.291 --> 00:14:47.375
Is it the one that screamed?

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:50.083
Right, the one that screamed like this.

00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:52.333
That one was so cruel
as it loved eating kids.

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:55.208
-No, the one in China wouldn't eat kids.
-I guess you're right.

00:14:55.458 --> 00:14:58.083
Da Man-si, who trained you ten years ago,

00:14:58.166 --> 00:14:59.458
will be the one supporting you.

00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:00.541
Hey, Man-si.

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.291
Commander, I'm Da Man-si.

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.458
Man-si, how is it going?

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:10.791
I invented several new gadgets
and I hope they will help.

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:13.125
A flashlight?

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.833
No, this is not a common flashlight.

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.708
It doesn't need batteries
as it is solar-powered.

00:15:18.791 --> 00:15:20.875
When there is light, it will light up.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.416
But if there is no light...

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.875
No, never!

00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:26.458
But will it still light up
even if there's no light?

00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:27.416
Good question.

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:28.708
Turn off the light.

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:29.750
All right.

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:34.375
Just light it with another flashlight,

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:35.708
then it will light up.

00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:37.083
See?

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:38.708
Doesn't it work?

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.333
-Turn on the light.
-Yes.

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:42.750
This invention is really creative.

00:15:44.208 --> 00:15:45.625
Look at that guard.

00:15:46.416 --> 00:15:48.250
Let's pretend that he's the man
with the golden gun.

00:16:09.708 --> 00:16:11.458
This is called Super Spy's Chair.

00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:15.416
This is for you to keep watch
of your enemies for a long duration.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.416
Are you scared or not?

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.291
See, you're scared.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.458
Right?

00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:25.625
-This is a powerful invention.
-Not bad.

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:29.375
Right now,
I'm trying to make a superweapon,

00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:31.416
which includes
ten kinds of killing weapons.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.291
-If this is successfully made--
-Man-si.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.250
Let's talk in my office.

00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:39.875
Chat, have you been working
as a butcher for the past ten years?

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.875
To be exact, a sad butcher.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.875
I am a sad vegetable hawker.

00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:48.541
Luckily, I have a part-time job at
the Central Psychological Research Centre.

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:50.541
-What's your job?
-To be researched on.

00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:54.375
Not bad.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.166
Ling Ling-chat, remember this.

00:16:58.291 --> 00:17:01.083
The dinosaur's skull
represents the esteem of our country.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.750
It is not allowed
to be in the hands of foreigners.

00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:06.791
Throughout the investigation,
you have to keep your identity a secret.

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:10.666
The man with the golden gun
is extremely mysterious

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:12.833
and very cruel.

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.375
You will be in great danger.

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:17.666
Ling Ling-chat, do you have any questions?

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.666
-May I be excused?
-You can't.

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:21.791
You have to set out tomorrow morning.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.416
Once you reach Hong Kong,
someone will contact you.

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:26.041
Understood.

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:27.416
-Is there anything else?
-No.

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.750
I'll personally give you 200 yuan.

00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:34.208
Buy yourself better clothes
before you go off to Hong Kong.

00:17:34.708 --> 00:17:36.250
Don't tarnish the image of our country.

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:37.750
-Man-si.
-Yes.

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.083
Buy me a cup of tea.

00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:43.541
-Remember to take back the change.
-Yes.

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:47.541
Man-si, Commander,
I'll try my best for my country.

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:49.125
Good speech, good pal!

00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:51.333
-Good pal, good speech!
-Good!

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:01.958
Are you crazy?

00:18:02.666 --> 00:18:04.750
Are you really sending a butcher
to look for the dinosaur?

00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:09.333
He was a very good spy.

00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.458
"Good"?

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.291
Are you taking me for a fool?

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.208
He hasn't been a spy for ages.

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:16.000
Does he still know how to shoot?

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:19.583
Deputy Captain, don't worry.

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.833
I sent him for this mission
because I know his ability very well.

00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:29.166
Of course, you do.

00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:31.750
Only you know what's in your mind.

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:37.458
In my opinion,
since the skull was stolen in Shenyang,

00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:39.166
it should be taken care of
by the Northerns.

00:18:41.416 --> 00:18:44.041
To put it simply, you don't trust me.

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.083
That's right, I don't.

00:18:46.416 --> 00:18:48.416
I have already sent my people
to investigate this case.

00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.375
I'll definitely catch the man
who stole the skull.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.500
Well, we don't have much to talk about.

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:55.958
Please leave.

00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:30.791
This man is gone for good now.

00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.750
Go to Hong Kong now.

00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:36.625
Send this document to a man
called Ling Ling-chat.

00:19:37.166 --> 00:19:38.625
Find a chance to kill him.

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:49.625

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SPY'S GUIDE

HAVE DREAMS, BE CIVILIZED, BE ORGANIZED

00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:47.458
I have booked a room.

00:21:47.916 --> 00:21:49.125
What's your name?

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.541
Sorry, your name isn't listed here.

00:21:57.791 --> 00:21:58.750
What?

00:21:58.833 --> 00:21:59.833
Really?

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.000
Please check again.

00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:07.000
Sorry, your booking
is not for Regent Hotel,

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:08.666
but it's for Regent Motel.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.208
Sir, since you are so good looking,

00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:30.708
I will only charge you 70 dollars a day.

00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:32.333
The check out time is at 12 p.m.

00:22:34.208 --> 00:22:35.041
What?

00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:42.666
Here.

00:22:43.333 --> 00:22:45.000
If you wear this, it will be better.

00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:45.958
Really?

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:52.416
How is it? Okay?

00:22:52.916 --> 00:22:56.333
-Yes, but this doesn't fit me.
-Do you want any hookers?

00:22:56.416 --> 00:22:57.916
Good idea, what kind of girls do you have?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.125
Mainlanders or local girls,
only 150 dollars each.

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:03.250
-I would like a local.
-All right.

00:23:04.208 --> 00:23:06.208
-Madam, what are you doing?
-I'm taking off your trousers.

00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:08.208
-Why are you doing this?
-You want a local girl, right?

00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:09.625
I am famous in this area.

00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:28.666
MEET YOU AT TRIANGLE PARK
WITH A RED ROSE AS A SIGN

00:23:47.666 --> 00:23:48.791
It's you!

00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.041
So?

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.458
Are you being tailed?

00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:58.333
Come and eat, hurry up.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.458
Hurry.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.041
Come on, eat.

00:24:32.875 --> 00:24:34.583
There are so many pretty girls
in Hong Kong.

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.583
You are so kindhearted.

00:24:42.125 --> 00:24:43.583
Do you always feed the dogs?

00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:46.625
Do you love painting?

00:24:46.708 --> 00:24:47.875
Yes, how about you?

00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:49.416
I don't like it.

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:50.958
I am just a butcher.

00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:57.250
What is that song?

00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:00.750
"Li Heung-lan."

00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:02.916
By Jacky Cheung?

00:25:03.125 --> 00:25:04.666
I know it, but I'm not familiar with it.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.000
I know Li Heung-kam better.

00:25:07.125 --> 00:25:08.000
Really?

00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:09.791
My name is Li Heung-kam.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.541
-Is your name Li Heung-kam?
-Yes, I am Li Heung-kam.

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:16.500
You're Li Heung-kam.

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:20.125
So Li Heung-lan must be your mom.

00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.666
Yes, she is my mom.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.083
Li Heung-lan is your mom.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.291
-Do you smoke?
-No.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.625
Come out.

00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:37.500
Come out!

00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.083
Why is there a cigarette butt?

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.541
The door is not even fully closed.

00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.791
Obviously, there's someone hiding
inside the closet.

00:25:46.208 --> 00:25:47.416
Step aside, it's really dangerous.

00:25:47.666 --> 00:25:48.625
Come out!

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.875
Do you smoke Kent?

00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:55.750
How do you know that?

00:25:56.166 --> 00:25:57.458
You were the one who threw this.

00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:02.833
Come on, wear your shoes.

00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:09.166
After a very long journey,

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.708
I am a bit nervous.

00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:13.375
But I can say this without hesitation.

00:26:13.458 --> 00:26:15.333
I really am a great spy.

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:17.291
Please return the slippers to me.

00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:19.416
Here.

00:26:20.416 --> 00:26:23.833
I'm very well-prepared for this mission.

00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:27.500
Look.

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:29.291
For example, this is the model F40.

00:26:29.375 --> 00:26:31.000
It looks like a normal mobile phone,

00:26:31.083 --> 00:26:33.500
but do you see this platinum layer here?

00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:34.500
In fact,

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.375
this is a shaver.

00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:41.333
It helps us to shave
without being noticed by others.

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:46.458
This is the 911 model
and it looks like a shaver.

00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:47.541
However,

00:26:49.458 --> 00:26:50.541
it's actually a hairdryer.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.291
Do you really need so many hairdryers?

00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:58.000
This is only a cover.

00:26:58.083 --> 00:26:59.166
Actually,

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.416
this is a shaver.

00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:04.375
See?

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.791
I guess that's why you're so handsome.

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.208
You're flattering me.

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:13.458
If you lose this hairdryer,
what will you do?

00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:14.541
What a simple question.

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:15.958
I am a wise guy.

00:27:16.791 --> 00:27:18.333
In fact, my shoes...

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:21.333
are also hairdryers.

00:27:25.791 --> 00:27:28.958
You know, being a spy,
one's appearance is very important.

00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:33.666
I'm sorry, but do you have any batteries?

00:27:35.083 --> 00:27:36.500
It's out of battery.

00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:38.125
No.

00:27:38.958 --> 00:27:41.291
Forget it, I will handle it later.

00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.666
I wish to know
that being an excellent spy,

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.791
what kind of gun do you use?

00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:51.083
Can you show me?

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.416
What a shame.

00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:55.375
I don't know much about guns.

00:27:56.375 --> 00:27:58.375
I am good with daggers instead.

00:27:58.708 --> 00:28:00.000
"Daggers"?

00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:04.583
Right, a dagger.

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:06.708
D, A, G, G, E, R.

00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:45.958
So amazing.

00:28:46.666 --> 00:28:48.041
-In fact--
-I get it.

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:49.458
Why don't we get back to our topic?

00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:56.333
As a spy, you have to have
knowledge about guns.

00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:59.916
This is called UFO Rifle
and it's suitable for long-range shooting.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
The range is 200 meters.

00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:04.916
This is a 224 tiny spittoon bullet
and especially made by me.

00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:06.958
I love its name.

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:08.916
-A 357 Magnum.
-So great!

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.583
It comes with a set of steel shot bullets.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.458
Can it kill a dinosaur?

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:15.208
You would have to try it
with a real dinosaur.

00:29:18.833 --> 00:29:21.666
This is PPK made in China
and it is used by mainland spies.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.916
Its range is 120 meters.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.625
Even though it can be loud,

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.416
with this silencer,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.541
you can kill without producing any noise.

00:29:36.666 --> 00:29:39.333
What is it that is stuck inside?

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.916
Perhaps a piece of cotton?

00:29:44.125 --> 00:29:45.708
Is it that simple?

00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:47.958
Don't you think it's toilet paper?

00:29:50.541 --> 00:29:52.375
You are so handsome and funny.

00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:55.791
I can't see anything inside.

00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:01.833
Well, it's cute.

00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:05.000
Does this fit?

00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:09.250
Mine fits too.

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:11.083
May I try?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.750
All right, but how?

00:30:14.083 --> 00:30:16.375
It's raining now,
so let me close the windows first.

00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:30.833
What happened?

00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:32.166
Why are you shot?

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.375
-I was trying to test this gun.
-But this gun shoots from the back!

00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:38.791
-Why didn't you inform me earlier?
-Wait, you're bleeding.

00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:49.250
What did you do?

00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:51.583
-I was testing the gun again.
-Again?

00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:54.250
Why didn't you ask me before testing?
This gun is called the Nicked Gun.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:57.041
It first shoots from the back,
then switches to the front.

00:30:57.875 --> 00:30:59.000
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:01.875
You're bleeding,
you should cover the wounds first.

00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:24.333
Kam, why are you sweating?

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:25.791
I just took a bath.

00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:27.541
Where is Ling Ling-chat?

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.708
He is still here, but don't worry,
I will finish my mission soon.

00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:32.416
-No, the plan has changed.
-What?

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.208
Kill him in Lai Yau-wai's house.

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:38.083
So that we can set him up

00:31:38.458 --> 00:31:40.708
and no one would suspect anything.

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:42.541
-Wait for one more day.
-What?

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.916
"One more day"?

00:31:44.541 --> 00:31:46.625
Wait, why are you bleeding?

00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:50.083
Nothing, I just brushed my teeth
and this blood is from the gums.

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.458
What kind of toothbrush are you using?
A broom?

00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:54.791
How are you?

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:57.916
Hi, Ling Ling-chat.

00:31:59.666 --> 00:32:02.541
Commander,
I am glad to see you in the toilet.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.041
How is your partnership going along?

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.083
Not bad, Kam is nice.

00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:09.208
She is a good friend of mine.

00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:11.166
Kam, what do you think about me?

00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:13.291
Other than your good looks,
I have nothing else to say.

00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:14.916
You'll find out
I'm good at other things too.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.083
I hope you will complete the mission soon.

00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:18.125
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:26.375
Kam, take back your gun first.

00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.416
Thank you.

00:32:28.583 --> 00:32:30.416
Don't move, let me help you.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.333
Save it for yourself.

00:32:32.416 --> 00:32:33.750
I am fine, thank you.

00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.750
Listen, never test out the guns alone.

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.958
I love it, what's wrong with that?

00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:51.791
-Waiter.
-Yes?

00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:54.166
I have heard that
the tofu pudding is famous here.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.750
-Yes.
-It stinks.

00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:57.125
It is famous for its stench.

00:32:57.583 --> 00:33:00.625
Can you bring me something
which is famous for its taste?

00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:02.916
-That will be our tofu pudding.
-Is that true?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.833
It is.

00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:06.708
Just imagine that this is stinky tofu
and you will find it delicious.

00:33:10.375 --> 00:33:12.125
-Give me some deep-fried ones.
-All right.

00:33:14.958 --> 00:33:17.000
Hong Kong shopping centers
are so wonderful.

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:17.958
They are.

00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:20.916
How are your wounds?

00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:22.833
It's no big deal.

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.625
Don't ever test out the guns
you don't know about.

00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:28.625
I should have learned
using dagger from you.

00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:31.958
I'm not qualified to be your teacher,
but let me tell you this.

00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:34.750
A real dagger is not controlled
with your hands.

00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:36.208
Try to guess what it is.

00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:38.041
It's air.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.083
Use the air to govern your dagger.

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:44.625
When you do that,
you can cut through anything in the world.

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:48.333
If you don't believe me,

00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:50.958
-I'll show you with this knife.
-All right, let's just eat.

00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:54.666
Kam, are you still mad at me?

00:33:56.083 --> 00:33:57.125
Don't be silly.

00:33:57.208 --> 00:33:58.458
What made you think that I'm not?

00:33:58.541 --> 00:33:59.958
I am very mad at you.

00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:01.125
Are you kidding?

00:34:01.208 --> 00:34:02.125
How angry are you?

00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:07.208
I would like to shoot you to death.

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:11.458
Why are you taking our picture?

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:12.875
-What are you doing?
-Calm down.

00:34:12.958 --> 00:34:14.833
I am actually an artist.

00:34:14.916 --> 00:34:16.958
I am trying to find
some inspiration about love.

00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:20.333
From your eyes,
I can tell that you two are lovers,

00:34:20.416 --> 00:34:22.583
so I couldn't help but take a picture.

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:23.791
I hope you don't mind.

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:42.916
You can have that photo.

00:34:43.833 --> 00:34:45.416
I'll keep this one, thank you.

00:34:46.625 --> 00:34:47.666
Thank you.

00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:50.625
Don't even bother, just take it.

00:34:58.708 --> 00:34:59.625
Sir.

00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:00.875
Did you just spit this out?

00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:02.750
Yes, is there anything wrong?

00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:05.166
It's nothing, I just wanted to know.

00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:08.416
From your accent,
are you perhaps from Hunan?

00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:09.875
Yes, I am.

00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:11.416
I came from Hunan too!

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.500
Which district are you from?

00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:15.291
-Cho Tao Town, Dongting Lake.
-Me too!

00:35:15.708 --> 00:35:17.583
What a coincidence! Which village?

00:35:17.666 --> 00:35:18.791
Shang Yang Village.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.666
It really is a coincidence,
we're from Shang Yang Village too.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.291
-Is that so?
-Who knows we'd meet our neighbor here?

00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:25.416
Excuse me.

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.791
There was a dog that always barked
near the entrance of our village.

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:31.291
I adopted that dog,

00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:33.250
but it somehow disappeared.

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:35.750
Then I found out that it was eaten.

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:40.083
That heartless guy dumped its bones
at the entrance of the village.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.125
Were you perhaps the one
who did such a cruel thing?

00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:44.958
No, I didn't do it.

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:47.416
-Then why are your cheeks red?
-No, they're not.

00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:50.958
-Your smile looks so awkward.
-It's not awkward.

00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:53.166
-I have a feeling it was done by you.
-No!

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.125
-Were you the one who did it?
-No, it wasn't me!

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:57.000
-Was it really not you?
-I didn't do it!

00:35:57.083 --> 00:35:58.708
-It wasn't me!
-Are you sure?

00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:01.000
-Thank you for the meal.
-It's no big deal.

00:36:01.083 --> 00:36:04.083
-Don't mention it, it's just a meal.
-Thank you.

00:36:04.583 --> 00:36:08.250
After all, us Hunan people
can't be looked down on.

00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:12.041
When we go back to our hometown,
we will be rich and famous.

00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:15.875
I won't bother you then.

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:19.166
If we meet again,
I will treat you to breakfast.

00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:20.208
See you soon.

00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:22.083
Hey, wait up.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.958
How about this?

00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:29.625
We should wait for two of my friends
who are picking up something.

00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:31.750
They will return soon.
How about we shop around together?

00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:34.041
-Thank you, but we have something to do.
-It's okay.

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.541
It's hard to meet your neighbors,
you should have a chat.

00:36:36.625 --> 00:36:37.750
I need to go to the restroom.

00:36:37.833 --> 00:36:38.791
Fine.

00:36:58.625 --> 00:37:00.583
Listen, I'll only say this once!

00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:02.375
Do you get it?

00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:16.958
You're so handsome
compared to other Hunan people.

00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:24.500
I know that you care
about your appearance a lot.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.083
If you lose the hat,
you'll look more handsome.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:30.625
Don't wear hats so often.

00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:33.166
In fact, I loved wearing hats.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.875
But someone told me
that hats make our hair feel stuffy,

00:37:35.958 --> 00:37:37.875
so if you keep wearing them,
you will easily go bald.

00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:39.625
Why is it taking so long?

00:37:39.708 --> 00:37:41.916
Aren't they supposed
to only grab something?

00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:45.083
Hey.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.166
What's wrong, son?

00:37:49.458 --> 00:37:50.541
Are you still angry with me?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.958
You've always been the one tricking me,
yet I only tricked you once.

00:37:57.833 --> 00:37:59.291
All right, I'll buy you some popcorn.

00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:01.083
-Really? Let's go!
-Yes.

00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:03.541
-You tricked me again!
-I'm going to beat you!

00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:08.916
It hurts.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.000
I told you not to shout.

00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:26.833
Hey, there they are.

00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:39.333
We're the police, freeze!

00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:49.875
Don't move!

00:38:49.958 --> 00:38:51.791
We're neighbors, so you have to help me.

00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:53.666
Come here.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.750
Go to hell!

00:38:57.416 --> 00:38:58.625
Are you okay?

00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.125
Calling!

00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:02.166
Send in an ambulance right now,
many people are shot.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.041
We're on the fourth floor
of Royal Castle, over.

00:39:08.125 --> 00:39:10.541
-Go away!
-Get lost!

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:12.458
-Move or I'll shoot you!
-Get lost!

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:13.583
I will shoot!

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.500
Move or I'll shoot you!

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:17.833
-Go away!
-Don't come over!

00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:22.166
-Tak!
-Don't come close!

00:39:22.416 --> 00:39:23.500
Don't come close!

00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:24.958
-Don't come over!
-I will shoot him!

00:39:25.125 --> 00:39:27.416
-Give me back my son, I beg you.
-Get lost!

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.583
-He's my everything!
-Get lost!

00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.958
Give me back my son!

00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:35.583
-Please give my son back!
-Get lost!

00:39:35.708 --> 00:39:37.541
-Just give his son back.
-Give me back my son!

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:39.166
-No!
-My son!

00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:56.083
-Watch him.
-Okay.

00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:57.583
We have taken control of this place.

00:39:57.708 --> 00:39:58.583
Come with me!

00:39:59.208 --> 00:40:00.083
Freeze!

00:40:13.416 --> 00:40:14.583
-Let's go!
-Okay!

00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:30.833
Hung, hurry up!

00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:36.166
Hung, come here quickly!

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.125
Hung!

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.750
-Hurry up!
-Faster, leave now!

00:41:15.458 --> 00:41:16.791
They're coming down, be careful!

00:41:32.875 --> 00:41:33.916
Is this vaudeville?

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.250
I thought I could kill
with someone's hand,

00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:48.916
but the plan failed.

00:41:49.291 --> 00:41:50.666
Didn't you receive an order from me?

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:53.250
How could you make your own decision?

00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:54.416
I know,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.333
but I really want to find out who he is.

00:41:58.458 --> 00:41:59.375
Shut it!

00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.666
Who do you think you are
to ask me this question?

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.000
You are in no position to know who he is.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.916
Remember this.

00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:08.791
Both your mom and dad were traitors!

00:42:08.875 --> 00:42:10.083
Your grandfather too was one,

00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:12.208
which makes you a traitor!

00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:14.291
It's fate!

00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.083
If I had not adopted you,

00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:18.458
you would have been executed with them!

00:42:19.291 --> 00:42:20.875
Your life is mine.

00:42:21.375 --> 00:42:22.833
So you're going to obey my order.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.375
Is that clear?

00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:29.291
Kam.

00:42:29.625 --> 00:42:32.958
I know that you're a kindhearted person.

00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:35.958
Do you know what he is?

00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:38.416
He's a beast.

00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.291
In fact, he's a nasty guy.

00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:45.125
He assaulted pregnant women
and molested little girls.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.833
Here, look at how small
these little girls were

00:42:49.625 --> 00:42:51.833
and how large the stomachs
of these pregnant women.

00:42:52.208 --> 00:42:53.875
All of them were hurt by Chat.

00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:55.958
You're not only helping me,

00:42:56.458 --> 00:42:58.166
but also the public.

00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:00.166
-Any questions?
-No.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.458
Good.

00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:03.250
Tomorrow, just do it as planned.

00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:05.125
Kill him in Lai Yau-wai's house.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.166
Understood.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.708
-Are you all alright?
-What's the matter?

00:43:21.791 --> 00:43:22.750
It's nothing.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.666
You have been inside for quite a long time

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.250
and you didn't answer me.

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:27.958
That's why I broke in.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.416
-Are you taking a bath?
-Yes.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.333
I'm fine, so please close the door.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:34.625
All right.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.750
I can't believe what happened today--

00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:42.416
I mean you should get out
and close the door.

00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:47.958
Get out!

00:43:51.958 --> 00:43:52.958
What do you want?

00:43:53.041 --> 00:43:54.416
-Do you want to do it?
-What is it?

00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:56.208
-Give money to the deceased's family.
-Who?

00:43:56.291 --> 00:43:57.958
-Tak's dad.
-Who is Tak's dad?

00:43:58.041 --> 00:44:00.375
The innocent victim who was shot dead
at the shopping center today.

00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:02.708
Donating money to the deceased's family?

00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:05.208
Would it be okay if we ask the press
to give Tak's family the money?

00:44:05.291 --> 00:44:06.291
I guess so.

00:44:06.416 --> 00:44:08.583
What name should we write?
The kindhearted guys?

00:44:09.083 --> 00:44:10.125
It's up to you.

00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:12.416
Since we're not close friends,

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.416
500 dollars should be enough, right?

00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.083
You should decide.

00:44:16.291 --> 00:44:18.750
-Can you pay the 500 dollars for me?
-What did you just say?

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:21.416
Once I'm finished with this mission,
I'll be rewarded with 500 dollars.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.791
-I can pay you back later.
-What?

00:44:23.125 --> 00:44:25.583
Trust me, I won't forget my words.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.375
All right.

00:45:23.666 --> 00:45:25.166
Put it down.

00:45:26.208 --> 00:45:27.416
More.

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:30.166
More.

00:45:30.625 --> 00:45:32.208
That's it, okay.

00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:34.791
All of these are dangerous explosives.

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:37.250
You have to send people
to be on watch all around the clock.

00:45:37.333 --> 00:45:38.208
-Roger!
-Roger!

00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:53.250
Lai Yau-wai always deals with smuggling.

00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.708
The lost cranium of dinosaur
might be related to him.

00:45:55.791 --> 00:45:56.958
This is him.

00:45:57.166 --> 00:45:58.416
Take action when there's a chance.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.333
-Do you have any questions?
-Yes.

00:46:01.416 --> 00:46:03.333
Is Lee Heung-lan your mom?

00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:06.083
As per my knowledge, she was a traitor.

00:46:09.208 --> 00:46:10.375
Sorry, I have no questions left.

00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:11.958
Time's up, let's go.

00:46:13.416 --> 00:46:16.291
Kam, if we finish the mission tonight,
I'll return to China at once.

00:46:16.375 --> 00:46:18.333
So tell me what you like
and I'll give it to you.

00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:19.375
No, thank you.

00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:21.208
-I insist.
-Then, white roses.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.083
Maybe, I'll give them to you instead.

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.708
If we have the time,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.166
I would like to visit
the karaoke of Hong Kong.

00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:34.875
I'll keep in contact with you.

00:46:36.166 --> 00:46:39.458
You know, my voice is like Jacky Cheung.

00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:41.166
My Adam's apple can move up and down.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.500
Here's the key to the rear door.
Hurry, or you'll have no time.

00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:45.208
I'll sing you a song.

00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:46.791
I'll sing "Lee Heung-lan."

00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:48.083
Listen!

00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:49.916
I'm forced to stay with you.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.416
Don't ever mention Lee Heung-Ian
or sing songs in front of me!

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.291
I don't want to hear your rubbish!

00:46:57.208 --> 00:47:00.083
I appreciate how straightforward you are.

00:47:02.958 --> 00:47:04.500
This key is not necessary.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.250
This box is not a simple box.

00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:09.291
It's a special box called Magic Box.

00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:12.208
It can send me to Lai's house
safely and gracefully.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:19.958
Magic Box!

00:47:24.083 --> 00:47:25.458
Why are you here? What do you want?

00:47:25.708 --> 00:47:27.875
I should be the one asking that question!

00:47:29.708 --> 00:47:31.708
I haven't adjusted the angle,
so the direction was wrong.

00:47:32.791 --> 00:47:33.666
Now, it's ready.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.375
Magic...

00:47:37.458 --> 00:47:38.375
Damn it!

00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:43.750
The door is open.

00:47:43.833 --> 00:47:44.791
Go in.

00:47:46.458 --> 00:47:48.250
Kam, I am not a fool...

00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:50.208
-Clean the blood first.
-All right.

00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:53.916
I think this box is wrongly positioned.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.166
Just adjust it and it'll be fine.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.625
-Don't waste my time!
-It'll be fine.

00:47:59.708 --> 00:48:00.666
Give me one more chance.

00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:07.083
Magic Box!

00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:21.916
A dry martini, please.

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.500
What are you looking at?
Give me another glass.

00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.916
What the heck was that?

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.250
Chat, how is it going?

00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:45.166
Dangerous.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.583
The guests are all very fierce
yet kind at the same time.

00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:50.291
You won't believe it.

00:48:52.041 --> 00:48:53.291
Sir, how about you?

00:48:53.625 --> 00:48:55.166
I can do it myself, thank you.

00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:09.333
Mr. Lai, a call.

00:49:11.208 --> 00:49:12.083
Hello?

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:22.958
Target discovered.

00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:40.333
Pay attention, the skull...

00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:46.416
Listen, I'll only say this one more time.

00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:50.458
Put the bones into hot water
to remove extra fats.

00:49:50.541 --> 00:49:53.083
Next, boil it with fish maw for an hour.

00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:54.875
-When will you come back for the soup?
-Enough.

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.666
Stop calling me.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.208
My wife is still here.

00:49:58.666 --> 00:50:00.250
Romario passed it to Pai Bi-to.

00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:03.416
Pai Bi-to scored with his wonderful skill!

00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:09.375
Chat, how is it? Can you hear anything?

00:50:12.291 --> 00:50:14.875
I believe that a man
called Pai Bi-to stole the skull.

00:50:15.166 --> 00:50:18.666
He then used his amazing skills
to shoot and score a point.

00:50:18.833 --> 00:50:20.458
But the signal is weak here.

00:50:20.958 --> 00:50:23.416
I'm planning to dig a tunnel
towards his sofa

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.875
and hear what he is talking about.

00:50:26.208 --> 00:50:27.875
Chat, cut the crap.

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.916
Go somewhere else
that has a better signal.

00:50:31.416 --> 00:50:33.125
There's radio interference everywhere.

00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:35.958
I can't hear what Lai Yau-wai is saying.

00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:40.291
Chat.

00:50:40.375 --> 00:50:42.541
Try to find a place that is not crowded.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.333
There's a piano in front of me
and it's not crowded.

00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:52.541
Go ahead and try.

00:50:53.333 --> 00:50:54.291
All right.

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:06.541
It's still not clear.

00:51:06.875 --> 00:51:09.208
Don't move, just sit still.

00:51:11.208 --> 00:51:12.291
That's perfect.

00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:16.750
I feel embarrassed
to be sitting here alone.

00:51:17.208 --> 00:51:18.875
You love singing, right?

00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:20.083
You should sing.

00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:22.000
All right.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.041
I forgot the lyrics.

00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:53.875
How was it?

00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:55.500
It was so-so.

00:52:55.916 --> 00:52:57.250
Just say anything.

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.666
Your tune was a little off.

00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:12.416
You were really great.

00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:20.041
You're amazing to have changed position
in such a short time.

00:53:20.125 --> 00:53:22.333
I guess you're really something.

00:53:22.583 --> 00:53:23.958
Just to be frank,

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:27.083
I'm waiting for a very important man here.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.500
I believe you know him too.

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.916
Sorry, no comment.

00:53:35.791 --> 00:53:37.500
I won't force you,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.333
but I have something to tell you.

00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:42.583
I really like you.

00:54:56.958 --> 00:54:59.541
Kam, do you copy?
It's very dangerous here.

00:54:59.625 --> 00:55:01.375
I don't know where the killers are hiding.

00:55:20.416 --> 00:55:22.000
What a golden opportunity.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.541
I was shot.

00:56:06.083 --> 00:56:07.708
How did you manage to walk then?

00:56:09.041 --> 00:56:10.500
Luckily, I put on a bulletproof vest.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.458
However,
there isn't any bulletproof trousers.

00:56:20.916 --> 00:56:21.875
This is for you.

00:56:23.291 --> 00:56:25.041
Where did you find them?

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.875
I got it while I was escaping.

00:56:27.375 --> 00:56:29.583
This is rare, you're really lucky.

00:56:41.375 --> 00:56:43.833
Don't be so serious, you lunatic!

00:56:44.625 --> 00:56:45.750
How did you know that I am one?

00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:47.083
Many people told me that too.

00:56:47.416 --> 00:56:49.041
The killer with the golden gun
is still inside.

00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:50.875
For now, let's leave. Go!

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.750
Hey!

00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:56.083
Who is he?

00:57:03.958 --> 00:57:06.291
I'm here, don't worry.

00:57:07.583 --> 00:57:09.291
You cripple, sit back
and let me handle this man!

00:57:18.333 --> 00:57:20.291
-Run over him!
-I'm going to do it!

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.875
You're lucky to have escaped!

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.375
Are you okay?

00:57:51.458 --> 00:57:54.041
Do you have a bandage,
cotton, and scissors?

00:58:02.166 --> 00:58:03.083
Yes.

00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:17.750
-I couldn't get any scissors!
-Forget it.

00:58:21.958 --> 00:58:23.875
The bullet is shot
right into the bone of my thigh

00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:25.625
and it's pressing upon my arteries,

00:58:25.916 --> 00:58:27.291
located near the trigeminal nerve.

00:58:28.708 --> 00:58:30.666
My left brain is lacking oxygen

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.750
and my body's right side
is starting to feel numb.

00:58:34.416 --> 00:58:36.958
I have to cut the wound
and take out the bullet.

00:58:42.416 --> 00:58:43.250
Let me do it.

00:58:50.041 --> 00:58:54.500
This is a legendary knife
which was made by a famous smith.

00:58:54.958 --> 00:58:56.875
It is made with a special iron.

00:58:57.083 --> 00:58:59.750
The total weight of this
is 25 kilograms and 113 grams.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.500
Ordinary people can't lift it up.

00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:05.916
This requires special skills.

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:08.708
In order to not come in contact
with the nerves and vessels,

00:59:09.625 --> 00:59:11.791
-help me widen the wound.
-What?

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:13.166
Can you do that?

00:59:13.916 --> 00:59:14.958
Yes.

00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.541
Can you see the bullet?

00:59:18.458 --> 00:59:20.875
-Is it the black one?
-No, that's trash.

00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:22.083
Look carefully, higher.

00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:25.375
-The white one?
-Yes, that's the bone.

00:59:25.458 --> 00:59:26.958
The bullet should be silver.

00:59:27.583 --> 00:59:29.291
I can see it now.
It is lodged deep inside.

00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:34.500
Dig it out.

00:59:34.666 --> 00:59:36.208
-Dig it out?
-Yes.

00:59:36.541 --> 00:59:37.666
Just like this?

00:59:37.958 --> 00:59:39.000
Just like that.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.416
Don't you need anesthetic?

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.458
Yes.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.666
Play this video.

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:51.833
-Did you give me the wrong tape?
-No.

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.625
This is called Shifting Attention Method.

00:59:54.916 --> 00:59:56.583
This is clearly a doggy style.

00:59:56.666 --> 00:59:57.791
Do you think that I'm an idiot?

00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:59.833
I mean this is my anesthetic.

01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:03.208
Have you read the story of Hua Tuo,
the greatest doctor of China?

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:08.458
Guan Yunchang played chess
to distract himself from pain.

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:13.083
Now, I'm going to watch this sex tape
to distract myself from pain too.

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:14.291
Go ahead.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:18.750
-You can watch it later.
-All right.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:30.625
The bullet is too close to the bone
and there are nerves around it.

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:32.666
-It will be very painful, so hold it.
-Look at that man.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.166
Why did you stop?

01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:45.791
I want my blood
to concentrate on one part.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.166
I don't want to lose much blood.

01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:48.833
Forget it, just continue.

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.666
It's blocking my view.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.916
Why don't you move it aside?

01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:58.416
Use more force.

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.250
What? Too much force?

01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:01.708
I wasn't talking to you.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.291
I was talking to the man in the video.

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.041
There's so much blood.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:10.041
You broke a vessel.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.083
What should I do?

01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:14.083
Keep watching the video.

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:30.458
Can you hold it?

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.500
Talk to me, ask me some questions.

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:36.375
Don't let me fall asleep.

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.833
I'm afraid I won't wake up
if I were to fall asleep.

01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:42.791
What's your name?

01:01:43.291 --> 01:01:44.583
I am called Ling Ling-chat.

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:46.875
You may ask some difficult questions.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.166
Difficult?

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.583
There is a farm,

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.875
the number of chickens
is four times the ducks.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:56.500
And there are nine ducks less
than the pigs.

01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:59.125
The sum of both pigs and ducks is 67.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:02.666
How many legs do the animals
on the farm have?

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:04.958
Let me ask you.

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:06.666
All right.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.791
Who are the man and woman
in that painting?

01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:17.916
My parents.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.750
Why can't I see their faces?

01:02:21.708 --> 01:02:23.666
They died when I was small.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.166
So I don't have much memory of them.

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:29.958
Both of us are orphans.

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.041
That's why we can befriend each other.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.041
Kam.

01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:38.250
Thank you.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.500
Don't mention it.

01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:45.250
Hang on, don't die.

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:50.250
Can you turn off the air conditioner?

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:51.458
I feel cold.

01:03:54.416 --> 01:03:55.333
Chat.

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.375
Chat.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.208
Chat!

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm lucky...

01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:09.208
This method works every time.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:12.833
Especially if you want to disinfect
and stop the bleeding.

01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:37.541
A 224 tiny spittoon bullet?

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.958
It is only used by you.

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:43.666
Where is your UFO Rifle?

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.375
Don't tell me it is in your car outside?

01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:56.083
You were the one who shot me, right?

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.708
Why did you save me then?

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:18.000
What is your relationship
with the man with the golden gun?

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.708
Don't ask, I won't tell you anything.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:21.750
I am a spy, but I couldn't kill you.

01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:23.000
That can only mean one thing.

01:05:23.166 --> 01:05:24.166
Go on.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.041
All right.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.000
I couldn't make it
even in such a short distance.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.791
What a poor aim.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.958
I can't help it.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.250
Don't bother me anymore
about killing and fighting.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.833
I rather watch porn videos.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.666
Just pretend that I have never met you.

01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:38.125
Chat?

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:41.083
Chat, don't go! You can't go back!

01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.875
Commander is the man with the golden gun.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.250
The dinosaur's...

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.416
Why are you taller?

01:06:48.916 --> 01:06:50.916
You finally told the truth.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:58.416
You look thinner now.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.708
It's not easy to be a traitor, right?

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:13.958
Miss, do you have a Band-Aid?

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:16.250
You're so cute.

01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:18.958
No wonder Deputy Captain
was killed by you.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:21.125
I want to see your commander.

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:23.083
Please show us the way.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:38.083
HAVE DREAMS, BE CIVILIZED, BE ORGANIZED

01:07:39.291 --> 01:07:42.291
Did you know that
Kam betrayed our country?

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.541
I didn't know.

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:48.375
Our country trusted her so much,
yet she...

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:50.000
Who shot you?

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.000
I believe it was done
by the man with the golden gun.

01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:53.750
Where is Kam? Where is she?

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.958
-I don't know. She is missing.
-Goodness.

01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:57.875
So careless.

01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:00.875
The enemy is too cunning
that they appear everywhere.

01:08:00.958 --> 01:08:02.041
Hey.

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.708
How is your wound?

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.833
-It will be all right.
-But you're bleeding.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.500
Here, sign this.

01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:10.541
Then you should go to the hospital
for treatment.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.083
It's urgent.

01:08:12.166 --> 01:08:14.708
-Guard, send him to the hospital.
-Yes!

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:16.583
You don't have to worry much.

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:19.166
This way, please.

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.958
What are you looking at? Hurry up.

01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:51.250
We have been waiting for you.

01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:53.125
Why is there an execution going on?

01:08:53.333 --> 01:08:55.958
-Hey, let's go the other way.
-There's no need. We have arrived.

01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:00.375
Hey.

01:09:00.833 --> 01:09:01.708
What are you doing?

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.500
It's heavy.

01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:06.916
What's the matter?

01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:09.666
-It's nothing.
-What do you mean, "Nothing"?

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.625
I have a problem with it. Hey!

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.958
Don't move.

01:09:13.791 --> 01:09:15.833
-If there's anything, you should tell me.
-All right.

01:09:16.208 --> 01:09:17.416
Ling Ling-chat.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.541
You signed and admitted
that you're a traitor.

01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:23.375
As you stole our country's treasure,
you deserve capital punishment.

01:09:23.583 --> 01:09:25.083
You'll be executed now!

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.333
Go back!

01:09:31.583 --> 01:09:34.416
-Wait, I'm innocent!
-Wait, I'm innocent!

01:09:34.583 --> 01:09:36.291
I didn't see
any national confidentialities.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:39.208
You should have some conscience.

01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:41.875
Everyone knows that I'm blind.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:47.083
How dare you frame a blind man
in reading national confidentialities?

01:09:52.708 --> 01:09:54.833
Listen, I'm a good friend
of Commissioner Chan.

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.041
I always have meals with him.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.333
Wait!

01:09:57.416 --> 01:09:59.833
-Wait!
-Wait.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.166
-My dad is Commissioner Chan!
-That's true.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.833
If you kill me, I'll ask him to kill you!

01:10:03.916 --> 01:10:04.791
Ready.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.666
Please!

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.583
No!

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:16.000
I'm so handsome!

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:19.875
-I don't want this!
-I don't want to die!

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:25.958
No!

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.041
Damn it!

01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:35.625
What an ugly face!

01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:37.958
You're so ugly!

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:42.041
Good shot!

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.416
Next.

01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:05.458
My 30 years of practice
is finally useful now.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:07.791
Get ready.

01:11:11.791 --> 01:11:13.916
Do you want to kill
a martial arts hero like me?

01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:15.208
It won't be that easy!

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.333
Ready.

01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:52.291
Execute him now!

01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:01.041
Take this container to the boundary
in 30 minutes.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.375
-The buyer is waiting.
-Understood.

01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.000
-Let's go.
-Okay.

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:15.291
Your buyer has been killed off.

01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:18.000
Now, the skull is none of your business.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.916
We'll send it back to Shenyang ourselves.

01:12:21.916 --> 01:12:23.708
Surrender now,

01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:25.541
or all of you will be killed!

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.166
The man with the golden gun,

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.458
I have caught one of your subordinates.

01:12:30.583 --> 01:12:32.000
You better surrender now.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:43.125
What the heck?

01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:46.916
Are you even human?

01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.541
Luckily, I put on a bulletproof vest!

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:52.208
I shouldn't have risked my life for you,
especially when you fired without telling?

01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:53.750
You wanted to shoot me, right?

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:54.750
Shoot him!

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.583
An eye for an eye.

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:19.833
I'll cooperate with you two.

01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:21.583
I know where he is, follow me.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:28.166
BE FAITHFUL TO OUR COUNTRY

01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:55.541
Come, I have been waiting for you.

01:13:55.625 --> 01:13:56.458
Be careful!

01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:04.625
I can shoot you to death this time!

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:27.166
Stop staring!

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.458
Show him what we have.

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.666
High-Temperature Flame!

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:39.000
I don't think your armor
can stand my High-Temperature Flame!

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:43.750
Gosh, I'm sorry.

01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:45.750
I used up the gas last night.

01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:47.375
I'm sorry for not informing you.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.375
-I'm really sorry.
-What?

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.625
Are you playing around with me?
I'll blow you up!

01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.083
It's your turn now!

01:15:00.916 --> 01:15:02.541
Don't forget me!

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.958
Wonder Fist!

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:41.458
I shouldn't have provided you
with a good living.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:44.791
You betrayed me for a butcher!

01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:52.541
Ling Ling-chat was just killed.

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.000
Since you love him so much,

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:56.458
I'll send you to hell with him then!

01:15:58.875 --> 01:15:59.791
Chat!

01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:06.916
I know your trick!

01:16:09.125 --> 01:16:11.000
If you do,
why didn't you tell me beforehand?

01:16:11.875 --> 01:16:12.875
Ling Ling-chat!

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.583
Chat, are you okay?

01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:17.375
I'm fine,
but please don't say anything cheesy.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:19.458
Weren't you supposed to be executed?

01:16:19.916 --> 01:16:21.375
I get so mad thinking about it.

01:16:21.458 --> 01:16:22.958
You made me lose a hundred dollars!

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:42.041
Leave now.

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:45.875
Here.

01:16:49.916 --> 01:16:51.416
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:57.291
A bad boss garners bad underlings.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.375
Your fellows are far greedier than you!

01:16:59.541 --> 01:17:00.833
What a shame that you are standing

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.083
in front of the words,
"Be faithful to our country."

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.375
If you, a revolting force of evil,
still exists in China,

01:17:05.458 --> 01:17:07.500
our people won't have better lives.

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:09.916
I have to kill you right now!

01:17:10.458 --> 01:17:12.000
You trash, do you think you can kill me?

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:13.250
"Trash"?

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:17.750
I used up all my days
to invent this superweapon,

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:19.750
Killing 3000.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:22.250
It is a combination of ten killing weapons

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:23.583
and now, it is finally done!

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:24.958
Chat, step aside.

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:25.958
Farther.

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:27.583
Way farther!

01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:29.291
Really?

01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.666
I would love to see it.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:35.083
Killing 3000!

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:36.875
Knife!

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:38.000
Bicycle chain!

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:39.125
Gun powder!

01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.750
Acid! Drugs!

01:17:40.833 --> 01:17:42.250
Gun! Grenade!

01:17:42.333 --> 01:17:43.208
Triangle sharpener!

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:44.916
Each of them can easily kill you off!

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.583
Now, they are combined
into one superweapon!

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:48.416
Are you scared?

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:50.708
You crazy lunatic!

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.666
-You should have been killed.
-Wait!

01:17:53.041 --> 01:17:54.041
Goodness!

01:17:56.666 --> 01:17:57.541
Man-si!

01:17:57.791 --> 01:18:00.041
Chat, you are our only hope.

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:08.291
Well, I have no other choice.

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:11.916
I have to fight alone!

01:18:15.583 --> 01:18:16.875
A butcher's knife?

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:29.208
A butcher's knife!

01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:51.958
No!

01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:28.166
What the heck!

01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:29.833
Let me see how powerful you are.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:31.708
I will let you witness my power.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.333
Come on.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:55.875
What kind of a knife is that?

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:57.708
A butcher's knife.

01:19:58.166 --> 01:19:59.416
It is used to kill beasts.

01:20:51.166 --> 01:20:53.125
Give me five dollars of pork, please.

01:20:56.833 --> 01:20:59.166
My stall is temporarily closed.
Come back an hour later.

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:00.583
One hour?

01:21:00.666 --> 01:21:02.791
I don't think you can last
more than three minutes.

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:04.333
I can last more than three hours.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.625
Chat, how about we do this
once we're home?

01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:08.750
Don't waste any time
and this place is nice.

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:09.916
Just leave.

01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:20.125
Chat, we're in trouble!

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:23.041
Our spy satellite is lost in space!

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:26.291
It is concerning the safety
of our country.

01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:27.375
I have been newly promoted.

01:21:27.458 --> 01:21:29.291
You wouldn't want to get me
into any trouble, right?

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:30.958
Come back here and help me out.

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:33.166
I'm currently busy with my girl.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:35.458
I couldn't care less
about the country right now, Man-si.

01:21:35.541 --> 01:21:37.666
Gosh, I have told you many times.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:40.416
My name is Da Man-si!

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:58.500
HERO OF THE NATION,
FROM SIU PENG
