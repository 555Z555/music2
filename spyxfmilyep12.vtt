WEBVTT

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.980
Ostania's capital, Berlint.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.780
This old lady is a contact for
the Westalian Intelligence's WISE.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.010
The man's name is Loid Forger.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.270
He also goes by his codename, Twilight.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.770
Profession: a spy.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.100
It seems he was
given another mission...

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.320
...in parallel with his
currently ongoing mission.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.370
I've been doing this for years now.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.290
Every day is the same...

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.790
A temporary peace...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.800
I wonder if the time
when we're no longer needed...

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.470
...will come someday.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.000
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.880
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.010
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.680
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.600
On the template of happiness,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.150
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.360
We can't be as we are,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.700
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.790
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.830
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.000
they still don't disappear

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.590
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.590
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.800
And I know

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.220
Every day is so mediocre,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.020
but I'm here and so are you

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.400
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.250
Mission complete.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.250
Good afternoon,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.790
or good evening, Twilight.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.260
Good job completing
your mission so quickly.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800
How's Operation Strix going?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.640
To preserve the peace
between the East and West,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.060
he is given a critical top-secret mission.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.810
And that is...

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.770
It's going well.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.310
I've secured a wife and a child too.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.150
...to "establish a family in the East...

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.820
...and infiltrate a certain school...

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.570
...to uncover the enemy's war plans".

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.530
Very well.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.040
The ironclad rule of
espionage is to not stand out.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.540
Continue your act as a mundane family.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.460
All right.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.830
Wait, you stopped smoking?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.710
I've got myself a child, after all.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840
And even though the Forger family
has been successfully established...

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.310
Loid said he'll be coming back late,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.640
so why don't we eat dinner outside?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.350
Yep.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.980
I guess being a doctor
is really hectic, huh...

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.110
He's having it tough...

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.110
Father's actually not a doctor.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.200
The daughter Anya, who the man
happened to adopt from an orphanage...

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.370
Father's job is a spy.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.290
He went to take down
an arms dealer today.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.960
...is a telepath who can read minds.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.040
Here's the plates!

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.710
Thank you, Anya.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.970
It's not coming off...

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.260
And the wife Yor, who married
the man out of mutual interest...

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.180
The smell of my
target's blood yesterday...

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.270
...is a gory assassin.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.270
A spy, a telepath, and an assassin.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.480
For each of their own interests,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.400
these three individuals decided
to live together as a pretend family...

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.660
(Mission: 12 - Penguin Park)
...and their not-so peaceful daily life goes on.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.950
Alongside Operation Strix,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.870
they also give me
extra missions every day...

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.670
WISE's lack of human resources
is starting to get serious, huh...

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.170
I'll still have to put on
an act even when I get home...

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.170
There is no restful day...

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.340
...for an agent like me.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.550
Hear me out.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.430
Isn't the family's husband
across our rooms so suspicious?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.470
Even though it's weekend,

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.930
he's still working this late!

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.190
The neighbors?

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.060
He also has a small kid,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.070
I can't stand him
neglecting her like that!

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.940
I rarely see the
three of them together, too.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.200
Maybe he's two-timing outside?!

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.570
What a jerk!

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.660
Maybe he actually got fired from his job,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.700
and he can't go back home!

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.660
I was careless.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.540
I was too busy with my other missions,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.460
and neglected my pretend family.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.050
In a disguise operation,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.340
even the slightest suspicion or distrust
of those around you can be fatal.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.550
I need to fix this situation
at all costs...

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.310
Our family's crisis means
the world's crisis as well!

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.310
Let's go for a walk this weekend!

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.560
Anywhere we should go...

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.320
...for a get-together?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.820
Oh, is that a penguin, Anya?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.280
All right, then.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.070
Why don't we go to the aquarium?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.830
Um... You look tired,
so why don't you just rest...

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.290
Yor.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.040
In order to maintain
our forged relationships,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.330
we need to take the initiative
and act like a normal family.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.670
That settles it, then. Be sure to
look forward to it on the weekend.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.840
So exciting!

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.840
I need to take care of my other
remaining missions until then...

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.350
All right, let's get going.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.860
Maybe you really should rest today, Loid...

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.740
Not a problem.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.610
Oh, Mr. Forger!

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.370
It's rare for you three to be together.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.450
We're about to go to the
aquarium together now.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.080
Aren't you excited, Anya?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.370
Huh...

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.540
In order for the neighbors to
not suspect us of being a fake family,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.630
we need to show them that we're a
happy and ordinary family, just in case.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.680
Father takes me for a trip,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.550
and Mother's nice to Father,
so they're both good people!

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.850
Anya's family is so normal, maybe!

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.560
That sounds like an explanation,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.650
but whatever.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.400
Well, then.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.980
Please excuse us.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.650
Wait up, kind and normal Father!

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.410
Clack-clack...

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Another contact request...?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.870
I have a bad feeling...

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.080
I'll go buy us some drinks.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.380
Okay.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.390
Agent Twilight, we have
another mission for you today.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.640
Nope.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.140
This one's coming straight from the HQ...

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.060
Nope.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.600
Today's an important
day for Operation Strix.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.650
Father!

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.360
If we don't hurry up,
the aquarium will go down!

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.570
It's just undergone a renewal,
so don't worry.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.650
Wait for me there.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.780
Well, you've heard her.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.740
Uh... I'll have a cup of
coffee and juice...

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.410
Wait, did she just mention aquarium?!

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.160
I'd expect nothing less of you, Twilight.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.960
The mission's location is
exactly that Berlint Aqualand.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.750
I can't believe you've
already arranged for it.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.750
No, you've got it wrong.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.670
It's just a coincidence.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.670
Please give me my coffee and juice now.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.760
There will be a transaction
of a certain piece of intel there!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.930
My coffee and juice, please.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.850
Listen to me, Twilight!

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.180
That intel is about

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.680
a new scientific weapons manufacturing
process brought in from another country!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.190
If this falls to the hands
of the terrorists,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.440
tens of thousands of people in
our country will lose their lives!

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.450
Lots of fishes!

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.080
Octopus!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.160
Starfish.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.540
Small shark!

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.870
She looks so happy.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.460
Loid?

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.250
Your face is rather pale...

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.960
Are you okay?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.590
I took the mission in the end...

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.880
But, well...

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.380
I've already fulfilled the condition of

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.760
showing how close I am
with my family to the neighbors.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.470
I just have to complete
this extra mission...

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.980
Oh, it's you, Mr. Forger!

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.480
What a coincidence!

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.690
Hello.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.770
What... in the world...?!

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.730
We just got here earlier.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.150
I can't relax now!

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.320
Wait, I could just shake them off...

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.280
Would you like to go around
the aquarium with us?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.870
Yor!

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.580
Oh, I guess we can.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.950
Father's got shocked.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.160
In order to act like a normal family,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.710
we must also get along
with the neighbors, right?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.170
There's no going around it.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.750
I'll finish my mission,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.880
and go back to my weekend mode ASAP!

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.720
According to our intel,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.880
they smuggled a
microfilm into a capsule,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.260
and had one of the penguins swallow it.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.970
Why a penguin?

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.430
It was brought in early yesterday morning.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.690
The buyer still hasn't
shown his face yet.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.110
Make sure you recover the stuff before
the enemy organization does at all costs!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.940
Why don't we go to the
special penguin corner?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.150
Okay!

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.780
I love penguins!

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.070
I want to see!

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.370
Welcome to the world's
biggest penguin park!

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.870
Pe-Pe-Pe-Penguin...

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.630
It's the main attraction of our aquarium!

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.880
We have 200 penguins here!

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.380
Which one is my penguin?

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.640
I don't have time to check
every single one of them!

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.640
I could just catch them in the act when
they're about to retrieve the film...

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:02.970
Wait...

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.140
As long as I don't know when
and in what timing the buyer comes,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.150
that's also difficult.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.150
It's impossible for me to monitor
all the penguins at all times alone.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.150
What should I do?

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.950
There must be something.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.660
Did they put a mark to tell
the penguin apart from the rest?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.200
Father's in trouble.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.370
He's so into this...

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.170
I guess he can be childish sometimes.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.630
Wow, that fish looks tasty...

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.460
Where'd my kids go?!

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.970
I wonder if she'll ever cheer up...

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.970
Fish...

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.680
- It's hard to read the penguins' minds...

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.560
- Let's play...
- It's hard to read the penguins' minds...

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.270
Want fish...

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.650
I'm hungry...

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.060
Come over here.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.610
Oegh!

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.900
Oegh!

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.950
Father, that penguin looks sick.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.660
It drinks a lot of water and spits it out...

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.700
There must be
something stuck in its throat.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.950
It might be worth investigating.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.460
Sorry, I need to go buy some drinks.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.710
Loid must be thirsty from getting tired...

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.970
Hey, where's our new guy?!

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.680
Already running late on his first day?!

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.760
Sorry I'm late, Sir!

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.470
Sheesh, young'uns these days are...

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.730
I'll teach you how
to feed the penguins,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.480
so come with me!

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480
Okay!

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.570
The fastest way to catch the target
penguin without causing a commotion...

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.390
...is to disguise myself as a caretaker.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.240
(Agent Twilight - Special Skill: Disguise)
...is to disguise myself as a caretaker.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.660
The first thing you should
remember here...

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.990
...is the penguins' names and faces.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.700
Have you read the roster thoroughly?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.460
Yes.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.000
I've taken a glance at
the waiting room earlier.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.170
A glance?! You idiot!

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.290
Even I needed two years

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.870
- to remember all the penguins...

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.050
- Oh, Chief.
- to remember all the penguins...

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.880
Be careful, you almost
stepped on Petilda behind you.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.510
Yeah, this is definitely Petilda!

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.850
This one's Phemas,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.520
and this one's Pescar, right?

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.520
How can you tell, new guy?

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:13.860
Hm?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.440
I mean, their motifs
are completely different.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.780
Their faces and heights, too.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.860
Even I still can't tell
them apart sometimes...

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.780
He's got a good eye and memory!

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.160
Fine, then.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.950
Time to feed the penguins now.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.080
Come with me.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.040
The penguin I've spotted
from the audience's seat...

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880
That's it.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.800
The emperor penguin, Pyarles!

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.720
I need to get closer...

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.300
Wha...

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:43.800
I-I can't move!

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.850
From a glutton to a picky eater.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.810
Each of them has their own characteristics
in eating, so pay attention now.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.980
I don't have that much time!

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.060
If I don't go back now,
they'll be suspicious of me!

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.810
Chief!

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.770
Please let me do it!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.570
Huh?

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.570
I figured it out from
watching a veteran do it.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.870
The most important thing
is how each penguin eats!

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.240
Who eats what, and how much.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.080
And the placement of each group!

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.830
If I could figure those out...

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.090
Controlling the whole
crowd is an easy feat!

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.970
We've got a genius new guy here!

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.640
Oh?

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.730
Looks like Pyarles lost his appetite.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.140
He might be sick,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.480
so I'll take him to the treatment room.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.150
Excuse me, then.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.070
Y-Yeah...

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.740
Sorry for this...

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.740
Bingo.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.240
There's something stuck deep in his throat.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.450
After a closer look,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.250
there's a mark under his foot too...

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.170
Hold on.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.380
I'll take it for you.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.500
Hey, you there.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.760
What are you doing with that penguin?

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.180
He seems unwell, so...

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.260
He needs the treatment room...

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.760
I see.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.850
Let me take him there, then.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.140
I'm sorry.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.480
We don't allow anyone other
than our staff to touch the penguins...

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.770
My apologies.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.650
I'm a marine biologist from Berlint
University's marine biology laboratory.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.780
I'm in charge of the creatures here.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.870
This is a fake ID card, no?

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.290
And a rough one, too.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.540
Who are you?!

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.970
Hold it!

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.760
Hey, stay put, will you!

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.890
Hey, new guy!

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.470
Where are you taking that penguin?!

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.390
The treatment room's over there!

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.140
I don't know how many
enemies are out there,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.400
so I can't just let go of
this guy that easily!

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.730
My first priority is to secure the film.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.280
I have no choice but to
give up on going after him.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.070
Huh?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.530
Where'd Anya go?

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.870
I need to inform my partners outside,

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.370
and kill him to retrieve the filmâ€”

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.760
- Who are you?!
- Mother! I'm being kidnapped!

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.970
Anya!

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.880
Let go!

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.760
What are you...

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.640
What are you doing...

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.220
...to my daughter?!

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.480
Wow.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.770
Are you okay?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.850
Oh, shoot.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.980
I went overboard with my high kick...

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.940
I hope he's not dead.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.480
Wow.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.360
Shortly after, Loid was able
to retrieve the film,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.490
and obtained information on the terrorist
organization from its caught member.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.750
Anyway, your husband's
not coming back at all!

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.790
He must be really two-timing!

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.000
What a jerk!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.880
Huh? That can't be...

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.750
My bad!

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.260
That took a while.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260
Loid!

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.550
Ta-da!

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.970
Penguin!

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.970
What a big stuffed animal!

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.010
What happened?

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.480
It's the prize for the
penguin names quiz over there.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.560
I wanted to get one
as a present for Anya...

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.520
I went and tried it so many times...

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.860
Man, was it difficult!

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.360
You're a liar, Father.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.030
You actually got in on first try.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.780
He's so cute when
he takes something seriously.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.160
You're surprisingly doing
a good job as a dad, huh!

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.790
I'm starting to see you in a new light.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.290
Oh, you flatter me.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.040
I am just an ordinary father...

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.040
...trying to protect my peaceful family...

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.300
...left and right.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.800
On a closer look,
you really look handsome, Mister.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.770
I was able to manage to
keep up our appearances here...

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.310
Still, I'm sick of being
overworked to death like this.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.650
I'll just file a complaint to HQ,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.820
and apply for a long vacation...

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.820
No...

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.780
It's my duty to maintain a world...

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.580
...without the cries of children...

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.080
...and wars anywhere.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.370
I don't have time to stand still.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.250
Father! The dolphin
show's about to start!

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.460
Sorry... I can't keep up,
so walk slowly, okay?

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.800
Huh?! I got promoted to a chief?!

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.170
Why?!

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.050
We have nothing more to teach you.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.270
I'm the boss of the
secret organization P-2.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.860
Call me Director Chimera.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.320
So you're the new guy, huh?

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.950
I'm Penguin from the aquarium!

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.160
Pleasesed to meeted you.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.950
Hm.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.250
Agent Anya, give me the stuff.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:02.790
Yep.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.340
It's a ritual of splitting a peanut
in two and eating it together.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.090
After you do this,

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.220
you'll be officially admitted
to our organization.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.150
From today, you are Agent Penguinman.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.770
Do your best for world's peace's sake.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.980
Yep.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.150
Agent Anya.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.200
Take the new guy
around our hideout with you.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.870
Okey-dokey!

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.460
This is the command room.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.210
We gather intel every day
with this machine.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.370
(By "gather intel",
she means "watch cartoon".)

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.760
This is Agent Father.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.340
He's a super elite who can do anything.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.260
What?

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.140
She's playing spy?

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.850
This is Agent Mother.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.140
She's strong, but she's bad
at everything else.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.270
Am I really that bad?!

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.940
They both are Anya's excellent henchmen.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.020
All right, onto the next one!

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.240
Looks like she's really taken
quite a liking to that stuffed penguin.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.030
Hmm...

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.660
This is the bathroom.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.790
We can heal our battle wounds here.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.460
This is Anya's room.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.090
All the daily training is done here.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.050
(By "training", she means homework.)

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.810
And finally...

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.060
Our organization's top-secret rooms...

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.320
Father's room and Mother's room!

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.360
Be on your guard.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.860
You may not live once you've
found out the secrets of these rooms.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.950
There might be the strongest
knives and the biggest bombs there!

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.290
All right...

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.250
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.510
I told you so many
times not to enter my room!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.840
Ah...

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.680
I mean, you can get hurt from
the scissors and the heater inside!

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.970
There're actually things that
are more dangerous than those...

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.060
He's right!

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.520
My room also has lots of poisons...

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.360
Anya hates both of you!

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.520
Anya will run away from home!

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.030
This is bad.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.530
If this continues,
Operation Strix will fall apart!

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.570
What do I do now?!

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.750
Hey, Sir!

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.420
This is no time for crying!
We have world peace to protect!

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.460
L-Let's just end the tour for now,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.550
and get ready for our next mission!

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.130
Th-That's right!

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.760
Let's go kick the bad guys' butts!

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.100
Okay, then.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.680
Follow me, you two!

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.810
The sweets store on the Second Avenue
is being hijacked by the bad guys!

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.230
Let's go save them!

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.940
Huh?

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.190
Be careful.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.570
The enemy may be
laying some traps here.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.070
- What're they doing?
- You're so amazing!

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.700
What a happy family...

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.700
A spy can't stand out...

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.040
After that,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.210
Anya started smiling again after
her parents bought her sweets,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.540
and the Forgers managed
to avoid further problems.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.010
Fighting with each other

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.340
'Til almost everything was in ruins

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.760
On this mischievous planet

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.270
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.150
My tears have run dry

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:04.400
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.780
I met you

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.450
where I came spilling out

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.450
You with all your secrets

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.920
Pretending to be normal

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.040
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:27.590
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.260
We made a deal that day

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.270
Thicker than blood

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:38.400
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.150
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.940
What should we eat tonight?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.700
"Here's what happened today"

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.410
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.160
Any and every day is

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.700
A comedy with you

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.580
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.630
Rolling around in laughter

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:08.470
We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life
