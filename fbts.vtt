00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:41.402
What are you doing? Why are you here?

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.797
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:45.183
I've made it clear earlier.

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:48.058
All of you, scatter!

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:47.225
Help!

00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:54.641
You're incredible. Why are you so great?

00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:56.308
Don't get too close.

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:01.891
Hey.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.058
You're dead, okay?

00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.766
Yes, I'm dead already.

00:07:15.516 --> 00:07:17.600
The mission has been completed smoothly.

00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:19.391
Chow Sing-sing, where are your men?

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.407
{\an8}We want a leader. We want teamwork.

00:07:32.802 --> 00:07:35.511
{\an8}Not a man who works alone like Rambo.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:39.495
{\an8}The hostage has been rescued.

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:43.000
{\an8}The rescue operation
is just a part of this exam.

00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:45.995
{\an8}What matters most
is the safety of your juniors

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.719
{\an8}and your leadership ability.

00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:49.725
<i>But I don't see any at all!</i>

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.766
Sir, give me a chance.

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:00.058
What are you doing?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.558
What are you doing?

00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:03.808
Don't!

00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:07.141
Sir, could you please reconsider? Okay?

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.475
Hello, who is this?

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.183
Yes.

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:17.850
The boss wants to see you.

00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.350
I'm Chow Sing-sing.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:42.183
Damn it.

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:44.975
You're so handsome.

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.766
Turn around for me.

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:51.183
Don't be shy, come on!

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:01.516
I couldn't resist, sorry.

00:09:03.183 --> 00:09:04.725
Do you want to get a promotion?

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:06.350
I don't want to be a gigolo, sir.

00:09:06.725 --> 00:09:08.350
I'm asking if you want a promotion.

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:10.183
I won't be a gigolo, sir.

00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.475
That's not what I'm asking.

00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:14.725
I'm asking if you want a promotion.

00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:19.683
Yes, but...

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.433
not at the cost of my chastity, sir.

00:09:23.808 --> 00:09:25.600
Who wants your chastity?

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:27.850
I want your youth.

00:09:27.975 --> 00:09:30.891
Youth and chastity
are equally important to me, sir.

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:34.558
All right. Let me finish first.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.516
This is the situation.

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.891
Some students had a field trip
at our police station.

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:45.141
Afterwards, we discovered
that a pistol was lost.

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:47.807
Sir, we lose pistols very often.

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:50.850
But that pistol is mine!

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.683
I feel so bad for you.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.516
Good that you know.

00:09:56.558 --> 00:09:58.475
That pistol has been with me
for over 30 years.

00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:00.475
I've never used it.

00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:03.183
It's for scratching itches.

00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:06.558
Speaking of which, I feel itchy now.

00:10:07.016 --> 00:10:08.558
Help me scratch it.

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:12.016
-Your back?
-Yes.

00:10:13.683 --> 00:10:16.016
It's a kind pistol.

00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:18.475
Can pistols be kind?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.516
It has a kind nature,

00:10:21.766 --> 00:10:24.308
but I'm afraid it might
fall into the hands of bad students.

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:29.183
Then innocents would be killed
and tragedies would follow.

00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:31.183
Don't worry, sir.

00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:34.891
I'll search the whole school
until I find your pistol.

00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:37.850
Would I need you
if we could do a search there?

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:40.141
I'm retiring soon,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.558
but I lost my pistol.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.808
It would be embarrassing
if people find out.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.850
So I want you

00:10:48.641 --> 00:10:50.308
to enter that school as a spy.

00:10:52.266 --> 00:10:54.558
I'm not confident in being a teacher, sir.

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:56.350
Not a teacher, but a student.

00:10:56.433 --> 00:10:57.641
A student?

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.308
I joined the police force
because I hated studying.

00:11:02.683 --> 00:11:04.391
I can't pretend to be a student.

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:07.975
Sir, if you do so,

00:11:08.058 --> 00:11:11.683
you're bringing me to a volcano
with lots of wild animals,

00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:14.891
paying no attention
to my cries and wailings,

00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:18.683
and just ruthlessly kicking me...

00:11:20.975 --> 00:11:24.016
into the volcano that's full of lava
without any pity at all.

00:11:25.808 --> 00:11:27.641
How could you be so heartless?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.016
That's good, you can live
and die excitingly then.

00:11:31.558 --> 00:11:33.766
Enough, you can't get out of this
no matter what.

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:38.225
Here's a pager watch. Put it on.

00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:40.433
666 means I'm looking for you.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.183
Also, let me hear,
"Good morning, sir" again.

00:11:54.808 --> 00:11:55.933
Very good.

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.850
Don't let others know
or both of us will be in trouble.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:54.475
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:12:54.558 --> 00:12:59.100
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:12:59.183 --> 00:13:01.766
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:13:01.933 --> 00:13:03.975
-Let's see if you'd dare to be late again.
-One, two.

00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:06.850
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:13:07.058 --> 00:13:08.391
-What are you looking at?
-One, two.

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:10.725
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:19.605
SCHOOL RULES

00:13:25.975 --> 00:13:28.433
You don't need to look at it.
You'll learn it by heart later.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.016
Let's go.

00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:38.850
-That's the new student.
-What a big guy. Which class is he from?

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:40.641
-Could it be ours?
-I don't think so.

00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:05.808
Chow Sing-sing.

00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:11.641
I'm the Director of Student Affairs,
Lam Zok-tong.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.475
There's a mosquito.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.350
You transferred from England High.

00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:40.558
Students from that school
are rubbish and senseless.

00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:43.850
I don't care if your family is friends
with the Board of Directors.

00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:48.683
Edinburgh College is a prestigious school
with the best students.

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:51.475
I won't tolerate bad influence.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.433
If you misbehave, I'll expel you.

00:14:55.558 --> 00:14:56.558
Did I make myself clear?

00:14:59.683 --> 00:15:00.933
Is that funny?

00:15:02.308 --> 00:15:03.475
Bring him to the classroom.

00:15:04.183 --> 00:15:05.641
Come with me to the classroom.

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:19.600
All right.

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:21.641
Around 1987,

00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:25.141
an observation conducted from
the sky above the South Pole confirmed

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:29.266
that there's a hole in the ozonosphere.

00:15:30.391 --> 00:15:33.641
Strong ultraviolet rays
are harmful to living organisms.

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:38.683
In a less serious situation,
gene mutation might occur.

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:42.600
In a worst-case scenario,
it would kill cells.

00:15:42.683 --> 00:15:44.766
Plants will die as a result.

00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:48.266
Ultraviolet rays can penetrate
into the sea.

00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:21.433
-Who's assaulting the police?
-What?

00:16:21.975 --> 00:16:23.141
Assaulting the police?

00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:26.308
You, bring the eraser here.

00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:31.225
-How accurate.
-Amazing.

00:16:35.933 --> 00:16:38.100
I don't care if you're new here.

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:40.600
Do you think you're in <i>Once a Thief</i>?

00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:42.100
What?

00:16:44.641 --> 00:16:46.641
I have my pride.

00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:48.475
Let's get back to the lesson.

00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:51.308
All right. We were talking
about the atmosphere.

00:16:52.229 --> 00:16:53.854
The atmosphere is made up
of several layers.

00:16:53.936 --> 00:16:55.270
WITH FORBEARANCE COMES PEACE

00:16:55.354 --> 00:16:59.312
The layer nearest to the earth
is called the troposphere.

00:17:00.391 --> 00:17:04.891
It's 15,000 to 50,000 meters
above the earth.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.391
It's also known as the boundary layer.

00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:35.891
MING DYNASTY CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT

00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:38.225
The Ming Dynasty is about
criminal punishment.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.100
They believe in torture.

00:17:40.683 --> 00:17:43.100
Especially for lying to the emperor,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.850
party affiliation and espionage.

00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:48.225
Wong Siu-gwai.

00:17:48.391 --> 00:17:51.016
Mr. Cheng, what does espionage mean?

00:17:51.141 --> 00:17:53.516
It's the current practice of spying.

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:56.225
The people involved are called spies.

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.475
They are punished by castration.

00:17:59.766 --> 00:18:00.766
Castration?

00:18:01.433 --> 00:18:03.058
Chopping off the sex organ, kid.

00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:06.100
By how much?

00:18:06.183 --> 00:18:07.641
It depends on how much you've got.

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:23.308
-Hurry...
-Hurry...

00:18:23.891 --> 00:18:25.516
-Sit down.
-Hurry.

00:18:38.308 --> 00:18:39.141
Gosh.

00:18:40.183 --> 00:18:41.350
I brought the wrong book again.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:42.725
I'm so absent-minded.

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:53.141
I'm so absent-minded.

00:18:57.766 --> 00:18:58.766
What's that noise?

00:19:15.808 --> 00:19:16.808
Hey.

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:18.933
Thanks for your help just now.

00:19:19.016 --> 00:19:20.183
Come and assist me.

00:19:20.433 --> 00:19:22.516
Come. Hurry.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.475
-Serves him right.
-Serves him right.

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:30.350
Hey, you're laughing so happily.

00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:31.475
Come here too.

00:19:35.683 --> 00:19:36.600
Come.

00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:42.016
What's your name?

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.683
Chow Sing-sing.

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.558
And you?

00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:47.016
Wong Siu-gwai.

00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:49.516
What's your name?

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:52.100
Chow Sing-sing.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.058
What's yours?

00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:56.391
Wong Siu-gwai.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.891
What's your name?

00:20:07.558 --> 00:20:08.641
Chow Sing-sing.

00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:13.683
Let's begin, Chow Sing-sing.

00:20:15.975 --> 00:20:18.891
This experiment is quite complicated.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.058
We must remember each step.

00:20:22.808 --> 00:20:25.516
It will be very dangerous
if you forget a step.

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:29.266
You said the most important thing
in this experiment is...

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.391
Memory.

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:32.600
If not, it will be...

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:33.975
Very dangerous.

00:21:30.891 --> 00:21:33.891
Hey, get down.

00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:35.516
-Go away.
-Get down first.

00:21:36.933 --> 00:21:38.183
Get down.

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:40.350
What are you doing? Who are you?
How is this your business?

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:42.225
Please get down.

00:21:42.308 --> 00:21:43.891
Why did you pull me down?

00:21:43.975 --> 00:21:45.725
You're standing on my belly.

00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:49.058
Hey, don't go. We're on the same side.

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.516
We have a passcode.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.433
Passcode?

00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:55.725
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

00:21:55.933 --> 00:21:56.766
What's the passcode?

00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:58.391
Chicken, turtle, bone, boil, spoon.

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:00.141
-What's that?
-The passcode.

00:22:01.266 --> 00:22:02.891
This is bad. Everybody is crazy here.

00:22:02.975 --> 00:22:06.058
-Don't stop me!
-You can't climb out from here.

00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:07.725
You can't get out from here.

00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:09.058
I'll use the front door.

00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:11.350
-You can't use the front door either.
-What are you doing?

00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:13.641
Nothing. This boy has suddenly gone mad.

00:22:13.725 --> 00:22:15.391
Yes, I've gone mad. I want to go home.

00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:16.725
What are you doing?

00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:19.891
Don't block my way, please.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.391
Excuse me, please.

00:22:25.683 --> 00:22:27.100
Excuse me, please.

00:22:27.183 --> 00:22:28.350
I want to leave.

00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:29.641
Are you all right?

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.350
I'm sick, I want to go home.

00:22:33.558 --> 00:22:36.141
Please excuse me. Thank you.

00:22:36.308 --> 00:22:38.058
-You're not feeling well?
-Yes.

00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:39.183
Come with me.

00:22:43.141 --> 00:22:44.475
Let's see if you've got a fever.

00:22:48.725 --> 00:22:49.891
You don't.

00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:52.600
I do.

00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:55.183
You don't. Look at it yourself.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.808
The thermometer doesn't indicate it,
but I do.

00:23:00.016 --> 00:23:02.266
I feel so bad.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.725
Let me see your eyes.

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:06.975
Look down.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.100
Look up.

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:11.850
Look to the left.

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:15.641
Hey, why can't your eyeballs move?

00:23:17.808 --> 00:23:19.516
They can't move since I've got a fever.

00:23:20.725 --> 00:23:22.225
Are you just pretending to be sick?

00:23:23.016 --> 00:23:24.141
I'm Ms. Ho.

00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:27.641
I don't teach your class,
but I'm your counselor.

00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:29.391
Go back to class first.

00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:31.891
Come to me anytime
if you've got a problem.

00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:33.808
Be good.

00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:39.391
Are you mad just because
I accidentally dropped your pencil case?

00:23:40.225 --> 00:23:42.808
-Get the phone.
-No, I'm not.

00:23:43.058 --> 00:23:44.433
I'm so scared.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.891
How much do you want this time?

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.850
Who knows? It depends on you.

00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:55.183
-I only have 300 dollars.
-I'm not scared now.

00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:02.183
If I find out that
you still have money on you,

00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:04.766
I won't throw away your pencil case,
I'll throw you!

00:24:05.475 --> 00:24:06.308
Understood.

00:24:34.808 --> 00:24:36.641
Great, my savior is here.

00:24:38.558 --> 00:24:41.058
Don't misunderstand.
I'm not helping you and I'm not going to.

00:24:41.141 --> 00:24:43.266
And I'm not your savior.
Let that be clear to you.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.100
You are! You look so ugly.

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:47.308
They'll only bully you
from now on, not me.

00:24:47.433 --> 00:24:48.600
Thank you very much!

00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:55.933
It's dismissal time.

00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:57.558
-They're out.
-They're out.

00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:58.850
Hey, John.

00:24:58.933 --> 00:25:00.850
-Hurry up.
-Don't block my way.

00:25:01.308 --> 00:25:03.391
Why are you so late?
Let's wait for my friends.

00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:04.725
-Hey, let's go.
-Let's go.

00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:11.308
Inspector Chow,
I remember the passcode now.

00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:13.350
It's Tong Dong Dong Tong Tong, right?

00:25:13.933 --> 00:25:15.391
-It's really you?
-Yes.

00:25:15.558 --> 00:25:18.100
-You should have said so earlier.
-I forgot the passcode earlier.

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:21.183
Inspector Chow, I'm CID 5798.
I was sent here to assist you.

00:25:23.016 --> 00:25:24.725
Go home and rest
if your hands are trembling.

00:25:24.808 --> 00:25:27.350
-Why become a spy?
-No, it's Parkinson's disease.

00:25:27.683 --> 00:25:29.016
I'm only pretending.

00:25:29.308 --> 00:25:30.891
It saves me from doing a lot of work.

00:25:31.058 --> 00:25:33.350
Our boss told me
to let you stay at my home for now.

00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:36.266
Why are you chewing that stick?

00:25:36.808 --> 00:25:37.725
To quit smoking.

00:25:49.558 --> 00:25:50.933
Hey...

00:25:51.225 --> 00:25:53.016
Forget about Ms. Ho.

00:25:53.141 --> 00:25:55.600
Her boyfriend is the head
of the Anti-Triad Unit.

00:25:55.933 --> 00:25:56.766
Okay?

00:25:57.475 --> 00:25:59.141
-What are you talking about?
-What?

00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:02.391
I'm looking at that kid
sitting on the rail smoking.

00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:07.100
-You mean Johnny?
-Who is he?

00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:09.100
The leader of the Four Tigers
of Beacon Hill.

00:26:09.308 --> 00:26:11.725
His leader, Tai Fei, is a big shot.

00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:14.683
He's the most suspicious one
regarding our boss' lost pistol.

00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:17.225
-Keep an eye on him.
-Okay.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.683
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:26:25.558 --> 00:26:26.391
Boss.

00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:28.891
You asshole, your idea is so lousy.

00:26:29.183 --> 00:26:30.516
-Boss.
-We're being chased for money.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.766
The interest is adding up.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.058
It's fine to deal drugs,
but why traffic arms?

00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:38.016
You said arms trafficking is profitable
during the Gulf War.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.516
You should have persuaded me otherwise.

00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:41.600
What are we going to do with these AK-47s?

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:43.475
If we had pistols, we could have robbed.

00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:46.475
-Johnny is here.
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600
-He's so arrogant.
-Arrogant?

00:26:48.683 --> 00:26:49.808
Because he's rich.

00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:51.308
You can be arrogant too if you're rich.

00:26:54.266 --> 00:26:56.016
-You're here. Come in.
-Hey.

00:27:00.975 --> 00:27:02.475
They're for feng shui.

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:04.350
-Don't touch them.
-Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:27:09.933 --> 00:27:10.808
How are you?

00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:17.058
Hey, you're so arrogant now.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.433
Don't worry, my dad is traveling.

00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:23.058
Even if you drive to Shenzhen,
he won't be back yet.

00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:25.266
Let's see.

00:27:26.391 --> 00:27:30.433
Right, give me the money for the two cars
my brother sold before.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.725
I can only pay you when my clients pay me.

00:27:33.016 --> 00:27:34.808
You're not really
in need of money, are you?

00:27:34.975 --> 00:27:36.725
Who says so?

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:38.100
The money collected from school

00:27:38.183 --> 00:27:40.516
isn't even enough
for two nights in a karaoke bar.

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:43.558
Hey. A couple of days ago,
I found something neat.

00:27:43.725 --> 00:27:44.808
See if you can use it.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.391
We worked really hard to steal it
from the police academy.

00:27:52.266 --> 00:27:53.433
A cop's pistol?

00:28:02.725 --> 00:28:04.850
Guys, three for each of you.

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.433
Don't fight.

00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:16.891
Are these your dads' memorial tablet?

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.225
I wish.

00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:20.683
Would I still need to work
if I've got so many dads?

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:23.641
They're all my ex-partners.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.725
There are noodles to eat.

00:28:31.516 --> 00:28:32.975
If you want to eat, make them yourself.

00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:35.183
No way. Eat myself?

00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:38.933
-Yes, you can eat yourself.
-That's illegal.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.350
How many partners did you have?

00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:44.516
Nine.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.433
But there are ten tablets.

00:28:47.808 --> 00:28:49.808
I have to prepare one or two more...

00:28:53.475 --> 00:28:55.183
I have to prepare one or two more

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.058
and see who's unlucky enough
to partner with me.

00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:01.683
It's fine whether it's used or not,

00:29:01.766 --> 00:29:03.600
just in case it's needed.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:06.933
Do you mind?

00:29:08.516 --> 00:29:10.391
What are you talking about?

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:12.141
You don't understand?

00:29:14.975 --> 00:29:17.100
It's better if you don't understand.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.058
Dying at an early age is really...

00:29:20.266 --> 00:29:21.975
Eat your noodles.
I'll have dinner outside.

00:29:23.266 --> 00:29:25.475
Remember to do your homework.
You've got school tomorrow.

00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:26.975
-Damn you.
-Don't...

00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:38.475
Let's move.

00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:40.350
It's nothing, go on.

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:43.391
-You've always been so gross.
-I'm used to it.

00:29:43.516 --> 00:29:44.350
Bravo.

00:29:44.558 --> 00:29:47.141
You see, I've been working as a janitor
in a school lately.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.141
it was fine at first.

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:52.933
But I have to work with Inspector Chow.
He's really troublesome!

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.391
He's really an asshole.

00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:58.141
Hey, what have you been doing?

00:29:59.183 --> 00:30:01.225
Don't mention it.
I'm having it worse than you.

00:30:01.641 --> 00:30:03.266
I'm following Tai Fei's case.

00:30:04.058 --> 00:30:05.183
It's arms trafficking.

00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:06.558
What a coincidence!

00:30:06.933 --> 00:30:08.850
We are also after Tai Fei.

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:10.850
But we're looking for a cop's pistol.

00:30:11.016 --> 00:30:12.433
-A cop's pistol?
-Yes.

00:30:12.516 --> 00:30:14.683
Really? No way.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.183
They're trafficking machine guns.

00:30:18.475 --> 00:30:20.475
-Machine guns in Hong Kong?
-Yes.

00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:21.850
The goods have already arrived.

00:30:21.933 --> 00:30:24.475
In broad daylight, they...

00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:28.600
Incredible.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.308
Hey, why didn't you arrest them?

00:30:32.141 --> 00:30:34.016
The buyers are terrorists.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.183
Our boss wants to arrest
all of them in one go.

00:30:36.558 --> 00:30:38.183
That's ruthless!

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:43.600
People will die if something goes wrong.

00:30:45.183 --> 00:30:46.975
We can't afford to alarm them.

00:30:47.808 --> 00:30:50.183
All right. Let's do this.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.808
Let me know if you have
any information on that pistol.

00:30:54.183 --> 00:30:55.433
Of course!

00:30:55.516 --> 00:30:57.433
-It's a deal.
-You have my word.

00:30:58.016 --> 00:31:01.975
Among the group of undercover cops,
all are dead,

00:31:02.391 --> 00:31:04.016
except you and me.

00:31:04.808 --> 00:31:08.266
Who else would I help if not you, right?

00:31:12.516 --> 00:31:14.975
Even I can die, but not him.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.683
What a lousy song.

00:31:21.975 --> 00:31:24.100
Tai Fei, don't be mad.

00:31:24.183 --> 00:31:25.683
We can talk it out.

00:31:26.225 --> 00:31:27.558
Remember Bill?

00:31:28.475 --> 00:31:30.391
You arrested him ten years ago.

00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:34.516
He wants to say hello to you,
Inspector Wong.

There's something to see here.

What did you say?

00:33:31.683 --> 00:33:33.558
I said watch carefully.

00:33:34.141 --> 00:33:36.516
Don't laugh.

This student is brainless.

He's useless.

00:34:15.808 --> 00:34:18.391
Yes, he's always absent-minded.

He's useless.

00:34:24.016 --> 00:34:25.600
He's ugly enough already.

00:34:25.683 --> 00:34:27.600
Look at him, it's as if he has a big neck.

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:29.516
I'm afraid he's not really a star.

00:34:29.683 --> 00:34:32.558
-That's right.
-I feel bad for his mother.

00:34:32.808 --> 00:34:34.391
-He deserves it.
-He really deserves it.

00:34:34.475 --> 00:34:36.475
He shouldn't come to school anymore.

00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:38.766
-Go home.
-He should be called Scar instead of Star.

00:34:38.982 --> 00:34:40.398
<i>HISTORY OF CHINA</i>

00:34:46.808 --> 00:34:48.225
What are you doing?

00:34:48.475 --> 00:34:50.475
You two should check the lost pistol,
not the dictionary.

00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:52.683
Sir.

00:34:53.016 --> 00:34:54.725
If he doesn't hand in his homework today,

00:34:54.808 --> 00:34:56.516
he won't be able
to go back to the classroom.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.308
He's going to be told to stand
in the quadrangle.

00:34:58.725 --> 00:35:00.266
Must you investigate in the classroom?

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.141
You can do so outside of class too.

00:35:03.141 --> 00:35:05.808
If I don't do my homework again,
I won't even be able to get into school.

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:07.433
Then I can't investigate anything.

00:35:08.725 --> 00:35:10.933
-Can you solve this math problem? Help me.
-Let's see.

00:35:11.683 --> 00:35:13.600
I know nothing about trigonometry!

00:35:15.183 --> 00:35:16.850
When you first asked me
to handle this case,

00:35:16.975 --> 00:35:18.225
your attitude was different.

00:35:18.308 --> 00:35:21.141
-No, he's always like this.
-I'm always like this.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.433
I was nice so that
you would agree to get involved.

00:35:23.641 --> 00:35:24.725
Sir.

00:35:24.808 --> 00:35:27.016
What about asking the policemen
to see if they know

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.391
and help us solve this.

00:35:28.558 --> 00:35:31.141
You're an idiot! Aren't we disclosing
the case to everyone then?

00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:34.391
Let me tell you. Finish this case quickly

00:35:34.516 --> 00:35:37.100
or I'll cut your brains out
with my Scissors Legs.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100
What legs?

00:35:39.183 --> 00:35:41.600
Scissors Legs that fly up in the air
and cut your brains out.

00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:43.891
Scissors Legs! Are you scared now?

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:45.266
Very.

00:35:51.558 --> 00:35:54.058
Scissors Legs, what a joke.

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:56.933
No, he used to be really incredible.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.975
That was before.

00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.433
He could fight 20 guys alone.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.266
More like masturbate 20 times.

00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:06.516
Dad, are you all right?

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.766
Dad, go to hell.

00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:08.808
How could you say that?

00:36:19.516 --> 00:36:20.975
Damn it! I'm late.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.350
Sir...

00:36:47.933 --> 00:36:50.725
What the heck? It's only six o'clock.

00:36:58.725 --> 00:37:00.058
He's so hardworking.

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:03.266
He influenced me. I need to study too.

00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:14.475
Hey, Fan Shu.

00:37:14.558 --> 00:37:15.766
I'm not Fan Shu.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.016
But you really look like him.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.058
Have you finished the biology homework?
Let me copy it.

00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:21.058
I wouldn't give it to you even if I have.
Are you nuts?

00:37:21.141 --> 00:37:22.100
Hey.

00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:26.058
I'll give you 50 dollars in return.

00:37:26.225 --> 00:37:27.391
Give me that.

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:30.266
You want the money
before giving me the homework?

00:37:30.391 --> 00:37:32.475
-Look!
-Go away.

00:37:33.141 --> 00:37:34.516
-There's money!
-One by one.

00:37:36.766 --> 00:37:38.391
-There's money!
-I have enough for you all.

00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:40.058
-Money!
-Any essay compositions?

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:43.225
-Don't fight with me!
-Keung, yours is torn, go away.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.600
-This is worth it!
-Hey.

00:37:45.683 --> 00:37:48.183
-He's quite popular.
-Yes.

00:37:56.933 --> 00:37:58.766
-Give me 12 dollars.
-You're only copying it now?

00:37:58.891 --> 00:37:59.975
How about ten dollars?

00:38:01.808 --> 00:38:02.975
You're useless.

00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:04.600
You don't have a future.

00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:06.600
Are you sure you don't have ten dollars?

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:09.600
-Look, I'm done.
-Come on!

00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:11.766
-You think you're so great?
-Of course.

00:38:15.058 --> 00:38:16.725
I'm not mocking you.

00:38:17.725 --> 00:38:20.933
I just want to say, from now on,

00:38:21.308 --> 00:38:23.850
I won't let anyone throw erasers at me.

00:38:24.183 --> 00:38:26.600
From now on, I won't be punished
by standing in the corridor

00:38:26.766 --> 00:38:28.308
or in the middle of the quadrangle,

00:38:28.516 --> 00:38:31.391
or hold a cardboard in public
like a monkey. No!

00:38:35.766 --> 00:38:37.308
Just take your time copying.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.808
Pop quiz! Those who fail will stand
in the quadrangle for a week.

00:38:51.433 --> 00:38:53.100
Seriously?

00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:55.433
-Are you all right?
-Never mind...

00:38:55.641 --> 00:38:58.766
CHINESE HISTORY QUIZ

00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:41.141
-A mobile phone?
-So what?

00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:49.100
You've got to be kidding.

00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:54.183
What? A Chinese history test?

00:39:54.516 --> 00:39:56.266
You two can handle it.

00:39:56.433 --> 00:39:57.850
No way, sir.

00:39:57.933 --> 00:40:00.683
I'm not good in Chinese history.
I'm good at pooping though.

00:40:00.766 --> 00:40:02.683
Hold on. Mandy!

00:40:03.016 --> 00:40:05.225
Ask all the seniors to come here at once.

00:40:05.308 --> 00:40:08.350
Ask them who suppressed
the An Lushan Rebellion

00:40:08.558 --> 00:40:10.433
and restored peace to the Tang Dynasty?

00:40:10.516 --> 00:40:12.433
A, Guo Ziyi.

00:40:14.975 --> 00:40:16.016
Is that clear?

00:40:16.183 --> 00:40:17.308
It's Li Guangbi.

00:40:17.683 --> 00:40:20.141
C, Li Keyong.

00:40:20.776 --> 00:40:22.859
It's Li Keyong, not Lee Hak-kan.

00:40:23.093 --> 00:40:25.010
WHO SUPPRESSED THE AN LUSHAN REBELLION
AND RESTORED PEACE TO THE TANG DYNASTY?

00:40:25.148 --> 00:40:26.773
A. GUO ZIYI
B. LI GUANGBI

00:40:26.975 --> 00:40:28.433
C. LI KEYONG
D. ZHU WEN

00:40:31.016 --> 00:40:32.058
Hey.

00:40:32.183 --> 00:40:34.683
A is Guo Ziyi, B is Li Guangbi.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.475
Who suppressed the An Lushan Rebellion?
Answer me.

00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:39.350
Guo Ziyi and Zhu Wen.

00:40:39.475 --> 00:40:41.600
No, I think it's Li Guangbi and Zhu Wen.

00:40:41.683 --> 00:40:43.058
So who exactly is it?

00:40:43.766 --> 00:40:46.975
Guo Ziyi or Zhu Wen? Answer me.

00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:48.766
What? You're checking the book?

00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:52.183
-No. I got it.
-Wait.

00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:55.641
Son, is it Zhu Wen? Who's Zhu Wen?

00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:59.058
The answer is B. It's B!

00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:02.433
Banana?

00:41:03.225 --> 00:41:05.516
B for banana.

00:41:09.308 --> 00:41:10.766
Ask them...

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.766
What? What is Niu-Li factional strife?
Answer me.

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:15.891
-What?
-Answer me!

00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:17.600
You're checking the books again?

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.808
You don't even know that?

00:41:20.016 --> 00:41:22.558
What have you studied? Eat shit!

00:41:23.641 --> 00:41:25.600
-Which big case are they working on?
-No idea.

00:41:28.641 --> 00:41:29.641
Apple?

00:41:33.475 --> 00:41:34.558
This is working.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.516
Next question, listen carefully.

00:41:40.183 --> 00:41:42.100
-It's D.
-Yes.

00:41:42.183 --> 00:41:43.516
The answer is D.

00:42:01.266 --> 00:42:03.016
-Again?
-Uncle Tat, what are you doing here?

00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:06.683
Nothing, I'm collecting rubbish.

00:42:06.766 --> 00:42:07.891
The female toilet is clogged.

00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:09.266
-Can you help with that?
-Is that so?

00:42:09.516 --> 00:42:11.683
-Yes. Come with me.
-Okay.

00:42:19.016 --> 00:42:21.016
Hello? What?

00:42:21.516 --> 00:42:23.016
The test is over.

00:42:23.558 --> 00:42:25.016
Sir, which case is this?

00:42:25.391 --> 00:42:26.933
-The three wolves.
-Really?

00:42:27.266 --> 00:42:29.183
-Aren't they dead already?
-We're re-opening the case!

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.433
I'm so stupid. Why didn't I think of that?

00:42:49.588 --> 00:42:51.630
<i>CHINESE LITERATURE</i>

00:42:58.933 --> 00:42:59.975
It's not here.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.141
Nothing again.

00:43:29.516 --> 00:43:30.766
Are you two riding horses?

00:43:33.641 --> 00:43:34.891
We're falling from the horse.

00:43:35.516 --> 00:43:36.891
So you two are cheating.

00:43:38.641 --> 00:43:39.850
No.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.516
I'm the only one who's cheating.

00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:43.725
Arrest me.

00:43:44.266 --> 00:43:45.433
Come with me.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.683
One moment, please.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.975
How ridiculous.

00:44:00.058 --> 00:44:02.308
You cheated in the Chinese History test
with the literature book.

00:44:02.933 --> 00:44:04.683
You're such a failure.

00:44:06.433 --> 00:44:08.433
That's not considered cheating then.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.058
I don't care.

00:44:10.683 --> 00:44:12.600
I only want to let him have
the proper punishment.

00:44:13.516 --> 00:44:14.558
What do you think?

00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:16.308
Deduct three points
for his conduct as usual.

00:44:16.725 --> 00:44:17.766
Don't say anything.

00:44:18.808 --> 00:44:19.891
Don't be so strict.

00:44:19.975 --> 00:44:22.433
A 12-point deduction
will get him expelled.

00:44:24.683 --> 00:44:26.975
-Ms. Leung, what about you?
-Kill him.

00:44:27.225 --> 00:44:28.225
What did you say?

00:44:28.308 --> 00:44:29.558
Isn't that what you want?

00:44:29.808 --> 00:44:31.600
It's just cheating.

00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:33.600
It's a phase everyone experiences.

00:44:33.891 --> 00:44:37.100
Who hasn't cheated before?

00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:40.016
The most important thing is
to know how to use your brains.

00:44:40.683 --> 00:44:42.475
You don't even know how to...

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.308
Stand properly. How dare you move?

00:44:47.391 --> 00:44:49.225
You don't even know how to use your brain!

00:44:49.308 --> 00:44:51.100
You deserve to be punished.

00:44:51.891 --> 00:44:55.016
I suggest arranging for another test.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.433
If he still doesn't pass,
test him again and again.

00:45:00.766 --> 00:45:01.933
Until he passes.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.266
Are you punishing him or me?
I don't have the time.

00:45:05.433 --> 00:45:06.891
Go to the race track less.

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.183
-That's right.
-I agree.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:12.391
I suggest talking to his parents
and understanding his family background.

00:45:13.683 --> 00:45:17.058
Fine, I've reached a decision.
Chow Sing-sing cheated.

00:45:17.433 --> 00:45:20.350
His punishment is detention for a week,
clean the playground for two weeks,

00:45:20.516 --> 00:45:22.850
a five-point deduction for his conduct,
and a retest next week.

00:45:22.933 --> 00:45:25.225
Also, I want to meet your parents.

00:45:25.683 --> 00:45:27.350
Parents? I don't have any.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.975
I've got no parents, siblings,
relatives, or friends.

00:45:31.391 --> 00:45:32.641
Who's your guardian then?

00:45:32.808 --> 00:45:34.058
I'm my own guardian.

00:45:35.308 --> 00:45:36.391
You can just talk to me.

00:45:36.558 --> 00:45:37.516
This is his file.

00:45:41.141 --> 00:45:42.600
Who's his guardian?

00:45:44.183 --> 00:45:45.266
Uncle Tat?

00:45:45.558 --> 00:45:46.558
Uncle Tat?

00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:50.141
-Be quiet. He's doomed.
-He's in big trouble.

00:45:58.225 --> 00:46:00.766
Uncle Tat, is Chow Sing-sing
really your son?

00:46:01.433 --> 00:46:03.058
You're ranked higher than me,
you tell him.

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:04.516
Chow Sing-sing, tell me.

00:46:16.058 --> 00:46:17.808
Don't laugh, tell me.

00:46:20.975 --> 00:46:22.266
Yes.

00:46:23.141 --> 00:46:24.808
Yes. I'm sorry.

00:46:24.975 --> 00:46:26.683
I knew it.

00:46:26.766 --> 00:46:30.016
They look exactly the same.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.391
No way. We look the same?

00:46:32.933 --> 00:46:34.516
-He's his dad?
-No way.

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:35.891
No.

00:46:36.016 --> 00:46:37.266
Here...

00:46:37.475 --> 00:46:40.100
Your last name is Tso,
but his is Chow. Why?

00:46:40.266 --> 00:46:41.141
I don't know.

00:46:41.808 --> 00:46:42.808
Why?

00:46:51.933 --> 00:46:57.350
When he was born,
I named him Tso Sing-sing.

00:46:57.433 --> 00:47:02.058
But for some reason,
he named himself Chow Sing-sing.

00:47:02.308 --> 00:47:03.641
Is that a good answer?

00:47:04.058 --> 00:47:04.933
Yes.

00:47:05.725 --> 00:47:07.683
Sir, if there's nothing else,
we'll get going.

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.225
Hold on, Uncle Tat.

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.933
We asked you to come here to tell you

00:47:13.225 --> 00:47:14.683
that your son cheated during a test.

00:47:16.183 --> 00:47:17.100
Cheated?

00:47:18.641 --> 00:47:22.725
That's not right. That's not good.

00:47:23.183 --> 00:47:25.600
You can't cheat. Right? Cheat?

00:47:25.683 --> 00:47:26.683
We'll get going.

00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:28.058
Hey, Uncle Tat.

00:47:28.766 --> 00:47:30.183
Don't you get it?

00:47:30.516 --> 00:47:32.725
Parents and teachers should cooperate

00:47:32.808 --> 00:47:34.891
to discipline a student.

00:47:35.058 --> 00:47:36.016
Am I right?

00:47:36.141 --> 00:47:38.183
Until when can we discipline him?

00:47:38.766 --> 00:47:42.516
Your son has only been here for three days
and he has already cheated.

00:47:42.891 --> 00:47:44.308
-Give me a few slaps then let's go.
-No.

00:47:44.391 --> 00:47:46.266
You should be serious
when disciplining him.

00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:48.433
-Don't be too serious.
-Of course.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.683
All right, enough.

00:47:50.933 --> 00:47:51.933
I know what to do.

00:47:52.308 --> 00:47:54.433
You jerk, you cheated?

00:47:54.516 --> 00:47:56.225
-You're not studying?
-Calm down!

00:47:56.308 --> 00:47:58.350
-Don't get too agitated.
-I'll beat the hell out of you.

00:47:58.433 --> 00:47:59.850
-You useless child!
-No!

00:47:59.933 --> 00:48:01.100
-I'll beat you up!
-No!

00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:02.766
-Is he dead already?
-He's dead.

00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:04.266
-You're lying.
-It's true.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:05.266
One more.

00:48:17.225 --> 00:48:18.891
-You son of a...
-Inspector Chow.

00:48:20.183 --> 00:48:22.475
You don't have to be this way.

00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:25.600
I had to use all my strength
to beat you up.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:28.225
Don't you know how tough you are?

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.183
That's right.

00:48:30.266 --> 00:48:32.808
I'm old and my bones are weak.

00:48:33.141 --> 00:48:35.558
After beating you up, I'm aching all over.

00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:37.975
-My fingers are broken. Yes.
-Really?

00:48:38.058 --> 00:48:39.266
I'm sorry.

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:42.016
Never mind. It's my job.

00:48:42.225 --> 00:48:43.558
See a doctor, I'll pay for it.

00:48:43.683 --> 00:48:44.933
-Thank you.
-Uncle Tat!

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:49.016
-Ms. Ho.
-Don't be mad.

00:48:49.683 --> 00:48:50.766
Chow Sing-sing.

00:48:51.266 --> 00:48:53.016
Do you know how great your dad is?

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.850
It's fine.

00:48:59.058 --> 00:49:02.641
All parents in this world are great.

00:49:02.808 --> 00:49:03.975
You can't let him be like this.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.391
Why don't I be his tutor?

00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:09.225
I have no money to pay you.

00:49:09.308 --> 00:49:10.766
How can we owe you this favor, Ms. Ho?

00:49:10.891 --> 00:49:12.308
-Uncle Tat!
-Dad.

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.933
I won't take any money.

00:49:14.225 --> 00:49:16.600
-No...
-I'll lead him onto the right track.

00:49:16.683 --> 00:49:18.933
-No...
-No, that's good.

00:49:19.891 --> 00:49:21.808
All right, we'll start tomorrow.

00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:23.516
Don't worry.

00:49:24.433 --> 00:49:26.808
Thank you...

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.350
Thank you so much.

00:49:30.558 --> 00:49:32.933
Save it, you got what you wanted.

00:49:34.266 --> 00:49:36.808
Do you want to die? You said no to her!

00:49:36.975 --> 00:49:38.350
Hey, be smart!

00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:39.725
Don't reveal your identity.

00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:40.850
Hey.

00:49:41.266 --> 00:49:42.850
-Someone is looking for you.
-Who?

00:49:42.933 --> 00:49:44.141
Go upstairs and you'll know.

00:49:44.225 --> 00:49:45.516
-Okay, let's go.
-Upstairs.

00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:47.725
-We must teach him a lesson.
-He's here.

00:49:47.975 --> 00:49:48.891
Over there.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.516
Whoever wants to help him,
stand on his side.

00:50:02.225 --> 00:50:04.016
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:20.975
If you want a protection fee,
I'll pay it for him.

00:50:21.141 --> 00:50:23.016
You must want to die.

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.183
I'll capture you
and make your mouth my ashtray.

00:50:27.308 --> 00:50:28.391
Capture him.

00:50:49.766 --> 00:50:51.058
You want anything else?

00:50:52.475 --> 00:50:53.350
No.

00:50:53.433 --> 00:50:56.100
Don't call me here if it's not necessary.

00:50:56.475 --> 00:50:57.391
Okay.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.933
-Gosh.
-Don't...

00:51:05.058 --> 00:51:06.183
How useless.

00:51:06.266 --> 00:51:08.225
Sing, you're even more powerful
than Bruce Lee.

00:51:08.308 --> 00:51:10.475
-Sing, you want your shoes cleaned?
-Sing, you're incredible.

00:51:10.558 --> 00:51:12.391
Do you have enough money?
I can give you some.

00:51:12.558 --> 00:51:13.433
-Sing.
-This is great.

00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:16.683
Also, your shirt
is not tucked in properly.

00:51:16.766 --> 00:51:18.100
I must hit you this time.

00:51:18.183 --> 00:51:19.266
Give me your hand.

00:51:19.891 --> 00:51:22.516
Give it to me.

00:51:23.516 --> 00:51:25.725
-I'm too old to be hit on the palm.
-Give it to me.

00:51:25.808 --> 00:51:27.475
-There's no need, Ms. Ho.
-That one.

00:51:29.558 --> 00:51:30.933
I'll give you somewhere else to hit.

00:51:31.183 --> 00:51:33.350
If you can bear it,
hit me with all you've got.

00:51:36.225 --> 00:51:37.891
It's like a garbage can.

00:51:39.308 --> 00:51:42.141
It'll be so embarrassing
if Ms. Ho sees this later.

00:51:43.808 --> 00:51:46.225
Hey, what's this? A toaster?

00:51:47.141 --> 00:51:48.391
Throw the bread away.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.433
And the porn magazines in your room,
you have to...

00:51:53.725 --> 00:51:55.266
I told you to clean up and you're eating?

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:57.558
-What?
-You're pretending? Come on.

00:51:57.641 --> 00:51:59.350
-I'm tidying up.
-Pretending to have Parkinson's?

00:51:59.433 --> 00:52:00.266
Is Parkinson your dad?

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.183
-You're always pretending to be him.
-I'm tidying up.

00:52:02.266 --> 00:52:04.433
I don't care how old you are,
I'll hit you.

00:52:09.225 --> 00:52:11.433
The son shouldn't have
a larger room than his dad.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.683
Ms. Ho, I don't quite understand this.

00:52:14.766 --> 00:52:15.641
-This one?
-Yes.

00:53:02.058 --> 00:53:03.975
Sit down, Sing.
Your hair has been ruffled.

00:53:41.933 --> 00:53:43.141
Next!

00:53:46.141 --> 00:53:47.683
Legs should be kept straight.

00:53:47.975 --> 00:53:50.683
Run quicker, do a somersault.
Yes, that's right.

00:53:55.516 --> 00:53:56.975
-Gosh.
-You're not wearing glasses.

00:54:01.183 --> 00:54:03.141
Next one!

00:54:03.225 --> 00:54:05.225
What's the matter?
Why do you look so bored?

00:54:06.141 --> 00:54:07.183
-How lame.
-You're bored?

00:54:07.308 --> 00:54:09.933
-Again?
-Let's ask Ms. Ho to take us on a picnic.

00:54:12.016 --> 00:54:14.766
Why don't you bring
your girlfriends along?

00:54:14.975 --> 00:54:17.225
-It'll be different with girls.
-It'll be different with girls.

00:54:17.308 --> 00:54:18.808
-Great, Ms. Ho.
-What a good idea, Ms. Ho.

00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:20.225
-Yes!
-That's great, Ms. Ho.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.391
Here, I'll help you light it.

00:54:23.725 --> 00:54:24.808
It won't light up.

00:54:25.391 --> 00:54:26.475
Great.

00:54:27.933 --> 00:54:29.516
-You're lame!
-You're smoking?

00:54:29.975 --> 00:54:31.808
When did you start? Throw it away!

00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:33.391
I'll report you to the police.

00:54:33.641 --> 00:54:35.808
-They're ruining their future.
-Don't you smoke?

00:54:35.933 --> 00:54:37.891
No, how can I afford it?

00:54:40.391 --> 00:54:41.600
You don't believe me?

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.766
Smell my breath then.

00:54:44.891 --> 00:54:46.391
Are you stupid?

00:54:46.725 --> 00:54:48.558
Look, my teeth are free
from cigarette stains.

00:54:48.808 --> 00:54:49.850
-Right?
-Hey.

00:54:50.725 --> 00:54:53.391
Hey, why do you already have wisdom teeth?

00:54:54.266 --> 00:54:55.516
How old are you?

00:54:56.516 --> 00:54:58.183
I'm...

00:54:58.308 --> 00:55:00.225
I'm 18 years old.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.360
-You're 18?
-Going on 19.

00:55:04.808 --> 00:55:07.016
But you look mature.

00:55:07.183 --> 00:55:09.683
Indeed, I'm ripe and ready to eat.

00:55:10.683 --> 00:55:11.641
That's right.

00:55:12.016 --> 00:55:15.725
All your classmates have girlfriends.
Where's yours?

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.100
I don't have any.

00:55:17.183 --> 00:55:20.975
I'm against dating while studying.

00:55:21.266 --> 00:55:22.725
I think it's a waste of time.

00:55:23.058 --> 00:55:24.933
-You're so cunning.
-Right.

00:55:25.266 --> 00:55:26.725
-Is it true?
-Yes.

00:55:29.016 --> 00:55:30.600
I've seen your boyfriend.

00:55:30.891 --> 00:55:32.850
He always waits
outside the school gate for you.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.600
How do you know he's my boyfriend?

00:55:35.766 --> 00:55:37.266
I can tell.

00:55:39.225 --> 00:55:40.891
He seems to treat you quite well.

00:55:41.933 --> 00:55:43.641
You're so nosy.

00:55:46.641 --> 00:55:47.766
But...

00:55:48.766 --> 00:55:50.433
I don't think we're compatible.

00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:57.266
Sometimes, you really can't force love.

00:55:58.683 --> 00:56:00.016
He's a cop.

00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:02.683
I hate cops a lot.

00:56:06.558 --> 00:56:10.183
I agree. I've never liked cops.

00:56:12.516 --> 00:56:13.516
What?

00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:16.225
Annie, I want to ask you a favor.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.725
What?

00:56:18.683 --> 00:56:20.141
Can I see your breast?

00:56:20.308 --> 00:56:22.141
-What?
-One side will do.

00:56:22.225 --> 00:56:23.933
-Just one!
-Breast your face!

00:56:24.016 --> 00:56:25.766
-You lose nothing!
-Siu-gwai, you jerk!

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:27.933
-You're so gross! How could you say that?
-Don't follow me!

00:56:28.016 --> 00:56:29.266
-Don't follow me!
-Don't run!

00:56:29.391 --> 00:56:31.850
Siu-gwai really does look like a turtle.

00:56:32.016 --> 00:56:33.016
Especially his head.

00:56:33.183 --> 00:56:34.725
With a shell, he'll look exactly like one.

00:56:38.058 --> 00:56:40.350
But Siu-gwai's grades
have dropped recently.

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:42.433
I think I must tutor him.

00:56:43.016 --> 00:56:45.641
But you're already my tutor.
How will you have time?

00:56:46.058 --> 00:56:47.641
You've already improved.

00:56:50.058 --> 00:56:51.766
I'll be his tutor then.

00:56:51.933 --> 00:56:53.766
I have improved.
There shouldn't be a problem.

00:56:54.433 --> 00:56:55.600
Can you manage?

00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.516
That's why you have to
continue tutoring me,

00:56:58.683 --> 00:57:00.600
so that I can tutor him.

00:57:01.308 --> 00:57:02.308
Get it?

00:57:07.266 --> 00:57:09.600
You get it.

00:57:12.808 --> 00:57:13.850
You get it, right?

00:57:14.475 --> 00:57:16.016
This is my home. What do you think?

00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.016
Grandma, pour us some tea.

00:57:19.433 --> 00:57:20.516
Sing, sit wherever you want.

00:57:21.016 --> 00:57:22.516
Sing, what games do you like to play?

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.891
Sega, PC or Super Nintendo?

00:57:25.558 --> 00:57:27.225
Later.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.725
You're such a nuisance.

00:57:33.808 --> 00:57:35.475
-Pour some tea.
-Okay.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.433
-Have some tea.
-Thank you.

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:44.558
-Are you classmates?
-Yes.

00:57:44.808 --> 00:57:46.475
-Do you study together?
-Yes.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.850
-You're friends?
-Yes.

00:57:53.933 --> 00:57:55.308
Are you classmates?

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.141
Yes, how do you know?

00:57:58.558 --> 00:57:59.600
Why so many questions?

00:57:59.766 --> 00:58:00.891
-Go.
-Have a seat.

00:58:02.058 --> 00:58:03.558
How stupid.

00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.308
Is she your maid?

00:58:09.516 --> 00:58:11.183
-She's my grandma.
-Grandma?

00:58:11.683 --> 00:58:13.808
-Where are your parents?
-They're seldom around.

00:58:14.641 --> 00:58:16.058
Sing, I have something great for you.

00:58:18.475 --> 00:58:20.266
You've got a lot of great things.

00:58:22.391 --> 00:58:23.975
I'm here to be your tutor.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:26.225
Hey, don't be silly.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.558
Grandma, try it.

00:58:44.058 --> 00:58:45.058
Don't be shy.

00:58:45.933 --> 00:58:48.016
It's free. What's the harm of trying?

00:58:48.475 --> 00:58:49.891
Go ahead.

00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:52.475
Was that fun?

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:54.641
Try a backhand, it's quite interesting.

00:58:54.725 --> 00:58:57.350
Try a backhand. Hit him at 90 degrees.

00:58:57.516 --> 00:58:59.475
Wait. Let him raise his head first.

00:58:59.558 --> 00:59:01.183
Ready, go!

00:59:02.933 --> 00:59:05.558
Good hit. Try both hands.
It's more powerful.

00:59:06.808 --> 00:59:08.891
Hit his head. Right there.

00:59:12.266 --> 00:59:14.391
She's crueler than me.
I didn't see that coming.

00:59:14.975 --> 00:59:17.891
What about Open Day?
You're responsible for the games.

00:59:18.225 --> 00:59:20.975
The theme of the games is fairy tales.

00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:22.516
Let's do Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.600
-What do you--
-<i>Snow White and the seven dwarfs</i>

00:59:24.683 --> 00:59:27.058
<i>-They're sleeping on the same bed
-They're sleeping on the same bed</i>

00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.391
<i>-Seven of them...</i>
-That's enough.

00:59:28.475 --> 00:59:29.850
-<i>Seven of them have...</i>
-Enough.

00:59:30.516 --> 00:59:32.016
You've gone too far.

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:35.475
Ms. Ho, actually,

00:59:36.016 --> 00:59:38.558
that may not be what we like nowadays.

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:40.308
Why don't you ask for our opinion?

00:59:40.475 --> 00:59:42.475
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.891
Just ask Eleven.
Eleven, what do you like to do?

00:59:47.058 --> 00:59:48.141
Play video games.

00:59:48.266 --> 00:59:50.141
-You hear that? It's the same for me.
-That's right.

00:59:50.225 --> 00:59:51.558
-Me too.
-That's right.

00:59:51.975 --> 00:59:57.558
Why don't we do something
more interesting and exciting?

00:59:58.183 --> 00:59:59.391
How about air guns?

00:59:59.475 --> 01:00:01.558
-Yes.
-Good idea.

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.641
-Air guns!
-Air guns are too violent.

01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:07.058
It's quite violent indeed,

01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:09.266
but that's better than
exposing yourself, right?

01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:11.725
-Let's eat.
-Thanks.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:12.766
Thank you.

01:00:13.183 --> 01:00:15.516
Stupid boy, why didn't you help her?

01:00:17.558 --> 01:00:18.516
What are you doing?

01:00:24.766 --> 01:00:26.225
-Ms. Ho, have some soup.
-Eat up.

01:00:27.016 --> 01:00:28.725
-Have a piece of pork.
-Thanks, Uncle Tat.

01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:30.058
-Dad, have some.
-There's no need.

01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:31.183
What about you?

01:00:33.725 --> 01:00:35.475
You got a high score this time.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.641
It's all thanks to you
for tutoring me, Ms. Ho.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.350
But Siu-gwai got a higher score than you.

01:00:42.475 --> 01:00:44.183
-Really?
-Look.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.183
That's because I tutored him.

01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:49.475
You know I've been tutoring him daily.

01:00:50.225 --> 01:00:52.808
Isn't it great if every student
is just like you?

01:00:54.266 --> 01:00:57.558
Well, it's even greater
if every teacher is just like you.

01:00:58.641 --> 01:00:59.766
There you go again.

01:00:59.891 --> 01:01:01.558
-Scissors.
-Rock.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.516
Paper.

01:01:05.016 --> 01:01:08.725
I can't even hold her hand.
I'm such a loser.

01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:10.933
Where did that kid go?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.516
Grandma.

01:01:12.808 --> 01:01:14.725
I'm not coming home for dinner.
That's all.

01:01:16.016 --> 01:01:17.933
Having a mobile phone is great.

01:01:19.225 --> 01:01:20.433
Siu-gwai, this is for this month.

01:01:20.516 --> 01:01:22.308
-It's that time already?
-Yes, please look after me.

01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:23.891
-Look after me.
-You should thank Sing.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.516
Hey, be alert.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.766
-Right, 30 dollars. Here.
-Sing hates dumb guys.

01:01:29.933 --> 01:01:31.016
What a waste of time.

01:01:33.808 --> 01:01:36.350
Sing loves this comic.
I'll take this as payment for next month.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.058
Siu-gwai, this is to thank you.

01:01:39.225 --> 01:01:40.183
What a smart boy!

01:01:41.183 --> 01:01:43.058
Hey, I have something great to show you.

01:01:44.558 --> 01:01:45.850
I'm calling you, buddy.

01:01:46.933 --> 01:01:48.183
Why are you acting so suspiciously?

01:01:48.516 --> 01:01:49.475
Stop right there!

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.391
I can do that too.

01:01:56.891 --> 01:01:59.516
Sing, that has nothing to do with me.
You did that yourself.

01:02:00.058 --> 01:02:03.266
You son of a bitch.

01:02:03.433 --> 01:02:04.308
Run!

01:02:07.183 --> 01:02:09.350
-Spread your legs!
-Let me go, Sing.

01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:12.391
-Why did you run when I called you?
-I didn't mean to.

01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:14.725
-What's your name?
-Wong Siu-gwai.

01:02:15.516 --> 01:02:17.058
-Where do you live?
-Kowloon Tong.

01:02:17.141 --> 01:02:18.975
-The whole Kowloon Tong?
-Next to Ideal Hotel.

01:02:19.058 --> 01:02:19.933
Turn around.

01:02:20.975 --> 01:02:22.225
Hands on your head.

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:26.725
Stop playing tricks.

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:28.183
What's this?

01:02:28.391 --> 01:02:29.558
-Your phone.
-I know.

01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:30.891
Why did you ask then?

01:02:31.016 --> 01:02:32.141
You're being rude to a cop?

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:37.975
-What are these?
-Hong Kong dollars.

01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:39.766
-I know.
-Why did you ask then?

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.683
Can't I ask you anything now?

01:02:42.141 --> 01:02:43.516
-Can't I ask you?
-You can!

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.058
-Can't I?
-You can!

01:02:45.141 --> 01:02:47.766
-Tell me, what are these?
-Hong Kong dollars.

01:02:47.933 --> 01:02:49.891
-I know!
-Why did you ask then?

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:51.183
Son of a bitch!

01:02:51.266 --> 01:02:54.975
Tell me I'll get up in the air and cut
your brains out with my Scissors Legs!

01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:57.016
Don't do that, Sing. The money is yours.

01:02:57.225 --> 01:02:59.391
-What does it have to do with me?
-It's the protection fee.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.641
What protection fee?

01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:03.183
I collect 30 dollars from everyone.

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:05.808
We're rich and powerful now.
We're the top gang.

01:03:08.475 --> 01:03:09.725
Top gang?

01:03:09.891 --> 01:03:12.766
Right, the Star Gang. Or the Star Group.

01:03:14.016 --> 01:03:15.058
-Leader.
-Leader.

01:03:20.558 --> 01:03:22.766
Listen, I'm not your leader.

01:03:23.058 --> 01:03:25.058
-Take your money back now and leave.
-Hey...

01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:26.975
They're talking to me, not you.

01:03:27.141 --> 01:03:28.141
Call him Grandpa.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:29.600
-Grandpa.
-Grandpa.

01:03:30.391 --> 01:03:31.433
They're such good boys.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.558
Tai Fei, just forget it.

01:03:35.725 --> 01:03:37.975
Let's not make a fuss in school
or we'll both be in trouble.

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:39.725
I look after you.

01:03:39.933 --> 01:03:42.433
Anybody who's bullying you is bullying me.

01:03:42.516 --> 01:03:43.975
-Am I right, Yiu?
-That's right.

01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:47.725
They're operating in my turf.
Do they think they're 7-Eleven?

01:03:47.808 --> 01:03:49.725
Yes, he's silly and knows nothing.

01:03:50.558 --> 01:03:52.225
Let me see how powerful he is.

01:03:55.225 --> 01:03:57.183
Inspector Chow, Tai Fei is here.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.475
It seems like he came here for you.
Be careful.

01:04:01.266 --> 01:04:03.808
Don't worry, it should be fine.

01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:12.891
-Grandpa, come over here.
-Over here, Grandpa.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:16.266
-Grandpa, we're doomed.
-Don't call me Grandpa again, you guys.

01:04:16.516 --> 01:04:18.641
Sing, Tai Fei is here to see you.

01:04:19.308 --> 01:04:20.433
Who wants to see me?

01:04:20.808 --> 01:04:22.766
He said he wanted to see the leader.
That's you.

01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:26.058
That's you!
You've been the leader recently!

01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:29.350
-What should we do?
-What now, Grandpa?

01:04:30.641 --> 01:04:32.100
Hey, kid. Stop.

01:04:34.808 --> 01:04:35.891
Are you the leader?

01:04:36.475 --> 01:04:37.558
How are you, sir?

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.641
So, you're the leader of the Star Gang.

01:04:39.808 --> 01:04:41.016
How arrogant.

01:04:42.016 --> 01:04:43.516
What are you talking about?

01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:45.850
You didn't even inform me
when you're in my turf.

01:04:46.766 --> 01:04:47.891
What's your rank?

01:04:49.933 --> 01:04:51.266
I'm second in my family.

01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:52.891
I have an elder sister,

01:04:53.516 --> 01:04:55.225
but she got married a long time ago.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.100
She's trying to emigrate
with my brother-in-law.

01:04:57.183 --> 01:04:58.516
-Are you making fun of my leader?
-Hey.

01:04:58.683 --> 01:04:59.975
Cops are here.

01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:03.016
Kid, you're lucky.

01:05:03.808 --> 01:05:06.350
Watch it, you won't be
this fortunate next time.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.225
What's the matter?

01:05:22.391 --> 01:05:24.641
Are you still tutoring Chow Sing-sing?

01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:27.558
Yes, though his grades are not that great,

01:05:27.725 --> 01:05:29.891
he has improved a lot.

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:33.766
Do you know there's a new triad gang
in your school?

01:05:34.808 --> 01:05:35.975
Triads again?

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:37.308
I've told you before.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:39.100
I won't give you information
about my students.

01:05:39.266 --> 01:05:41.391
I'm not asking for information.
I just want to tell you

01:05:41.558 --> 01:05:43.516
that the new triad gang
in your school is the Star Gang.

01:05:43.766 --> 01:05:46.475
The leader is your student,
Chow Sing-sing.

01:05:46.891 --> 01:05:48.058
That's ridiculous.

01:05:48.516 --> 01:05:49.808
I'm warning you.

01:05:50.225 --> 01:05:52.808
He's my student, not a triad leader.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:54.350
But he's a bad element in the school.

01:05:54.641 --> 01:05:57.808
I've told you.
There are no bad elements in my school.

01:05:58.016 --> 01:06:00.141
We have to lead the bad students
onto the right track.

01:06:00.225 --> 01:06:02.350
Fine, forget it. Enough.

01:06:02.433 --> 01:06:04.891
I don't want to ruin our relationship
because of him.

01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:08.725
Can you stop being his tutor?

01:06:09.683 --> 01:06:11.433
I'm your boyfriend, I'm worried about you.

01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:14.975
I teach students
to trust those around him.

01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:18.225
Yet you ask me not to trust my students.

01:06:57.266 --> 01:06:58.975
Let's have our lesson
in the bedroom today.

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:01.016
My dad is playing with birds outside.

01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:03.058
I don't want to disturb him.

01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:06.058
Are you all right, Ms. Ho?

01:07:07.266 --> 01:07:08.308
Let's study in the bedroom.

01:07:08.475 --> 01:07:09.475
All right.

01:07:12.308 --> 01:07:13.183
Hey.

01:07:14.225 --> 01:07:15.266
Party in the bedroom?

01:07:15.558 --> 01:07:16.600
What?

01:07:17.058 --> 01:07:18.850
-Take a walk outside.
-Where would I walk to?

01:07:19.016 --> 01:07:21.016
To Guangzhou, if you like.

01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:24.016
One for you, one for me.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:25.933
You're mistaken.

01:07:26.016 --> 01:07:27.766
I'm not, yours is super thin.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.933
-Really?
-Really.

01:07:30.808 --> 01:07:33.766
I'm not the person you think I am.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.725
-And I won't--
-Take it, she's a good girl.

01:07:36.808 --> 01:07:39.183
Don't ruin her, 15 minutes will be enough.

01:07:39.766 --> 01:07:41.600
Just go, cut the crap.

01:07:43.641 --> 01:07:44.725
You're crazy.

01:07:45.183 --> 01:07:46.308
Are you kidding me?

01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:48.266
You asked me to get out of my own house.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:49.975
Are you Chow Sing-sing's dad?

01:07:50.516 --> 01:07:52.308
-Yes.
-He said yes.

01:07:52.558 --> 01:07:54.350
Hey, what are you doing?

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.350
It's gum.

01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:46.516
A chewing gum.

01:08:53.641 --> 01:08:54.641
Let's start the lesson.

01:08:54.725 --> 01:08:55.933
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:08:56.516 --> 01:08:57.766
I'm disappointed in you.

01:09:03.183 --> 01:09:07.016
Help...

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.933
Uncle Tat?

01:09:08.016 --> 01:09:09.308
-What happened?
-Move!

01:09:14.516 --> 01:09:15.600
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

01:09:15.683 --> 01:09:16.891
-Uncle Tat.
-Step aside.

01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:41.225
Don't...

01:09:41.308 --> 01:09:42.266
Give me a chance.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.016
-Who asked you to come?
-Tai Fei.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.558
Please give me another chance.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:48.266
Give you another chance to do what?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.266
-To go away.
-Where to?

01:09:50.641 --> 01:09:51.725
I don't know.

01:09:53.183 --> 01:09:55.225
Go home and get some sleep.

01:09:55.308 --> 01:09:56.725
Your mom misses you.

01:09:57.683 --> 01:10:00.141
Inspector Chow,
you're number one in SDU indeed.

01:10:00.225 --> 01:10:01.266
That's just basic.

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:03.516
Should all cops be like you instead?

01:10:03.725 --> 01:10:04.600
You're right.

01:10:04.683 --> 01:10:07.225
-Dad, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

01:10:07.308 --> 01:10:09.558
-I'll just rub some medicinal oil later.
-Let me do it for you.

01:10:09.641 --> 01:10:11.683
-Good boy.
-Stop pretending.

01:10:12.183 --> 01:10:15.558
You're not a student
and you're not his dad.

01:10:16.016 --> 01:10:17.850
We are indeed a dad and his son.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.141
Though I look younger than him,
he's my real son.

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:28.058
Actually...

01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:31.266
I can't tell you these things,

01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:33.558
but I don't want to lie to you.

01:10:35.641 --> 01:10:36.641
I'm a cop.

01:10:36.808 --> 01:10:38.808
Inspector Chow, what's done is done.

01:10:38.975 --> 01:10:40.683
-You can tell her.
-Damn it.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.766
I'm a cop.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.433
I entered the school to look into a case.

01:10:51.183 --> 01:10:54.558
But I really want to help the kids,
I really do.

01:10:55.808 --> 01:10:58.683
I don't care and I don't want to know.

01:10:59.225 --> 01:11:01.433
But please stop playing tricks on me,
Inspector Chow.

01:11:03.391 --> 01:11:04.516
What are you doing?

01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:07.516
Don't tell the others.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.058
Okay?

01:11:13.225 --> 01:11:14.308
Don't.

01:11:16.516 --> 01:11:19.266
Hey, will she tell the others?

01:11:19.641 --> 01:11:21.391
She will. Go and kill her.

01:11:25.975 --> 01:11:28.641
Save it, you stinky mouth!

01:11:28.808 --> 01:11:30.308
I should kill you first!

01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:32.433
-Just save it!
-Okay...

01:11:36.975 --> 01:11:38.308
Did I say too much?

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.558
Do you believe I'll smash your head
with my Iron Palm?

01:11:41.975 --> 01:11:43.600
-I do.
-I do.

01:11:43.683 --> 01:11:45.100
That palm looked so cool.

01:11:45.183 --> 01:11:46.016
Yes.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.183
You've been there for two months
and you've found nothing.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.183
Tell me, what have you done all this time?

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:52.725
Tell him.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:54.975
This is what I did.

01:11:55.058 --> 01:11:57.808
First, I established a relationship
with the students and teachers.

01:11:57.975 --> 01:11:59.683
Yes, he's building a relationship.

01:11:59.808 --> 01:12:01.433
I don't care.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.683
Find that pistol within a month.

01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:05.433
Otherwise, both of you will get demoted.

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:08.725
It doesn't matter to me.
I was born lowly, I'm not ambitious.

01:12:08.975 --> 01:12:10.391
I'll transfer you to guard the border.

01:12:10.475 --> 01:12:11.891
Great! Thanks a lot!

01:12:13.058 --> 01:12:14.308
Don't be so rash, sir.

01:12:14.475 --> 01:12:16.975
Your Iron Palm is incredible.
We're really scared, right?

01:12:17.141 --> 01:12:18.475
Yes, we're so scared.

01:12:18.558 --> 01:12:20.016
Please keep that Iron Palm first.

01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:22.141
We'll do it as soon as we can.

01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:26.350
The students will do a good job
for Open Day this year.

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:29.266
They better do. Last year was boring.

01:13:07.058 --> 01:13:08.600
Hey, are you all right?

01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:12.475
Hey.

01:13:13.808 --> 01:13:15.183
Lend me your pager.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.350
-What for?
-Lend it to me.

01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:19.725
-The pager is mine.
-Lend it to me!

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.391
-I bought the pager with my--
-I know.

01:13:25.475 --> 01:13:27.391
I'll return it to you afterwards. Thanks.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.850
MISS HO, PLEASE PRESS NEXT

01:13:42.558 --> 01:13:45.433
<i>If not for you, I wouldn't have
scored over 80 in Geography.</i>

01:13:45.975 --> 01:13:49.100
<i>If not for you, the kids
wouldn't have listened to me.</i>

01:13:49.975 --> 01:13:53.141
<i>You told me one's goal in life
should be helping others, not money.</i>

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.891
<i>Now, I'm telling you.
My goal in life is you.</i>

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.225
<i>I'm sorry because I lied to you.</i>

01:13:59.016 --> 01:14:01.891
<i>I'm sorry because
I'll be pursuing you from now on.</i>

01:14:02.183 --> 01:14:03.433
<i>Chow Sing-sing.</i>

01:14:13.641 --> 01:14:15.433
How lame! I'll confiscate the pager.

01:14:17.641 --> 01:14:19.683
Hey, the pager is mine.

01:14:21.391 --> 01:14:22.600
Why are you standing here?

01:14:22.808 --> 01:14:25.141
-The pager is mine.
-Tell me, why are you standing here?

01:14:25.308 --> 01:14:27.933
-The pager is mine.
-We were talking. You blocked me.

01:14:28.141 --> 01:14:30.766
-Hey, the pager is mine.
-You're blocking me. Can you...

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:36.475
Somebody is here to kill you, run.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:40.475
Siu-gwai, run!

01:14:42.933 --> 01:14:43.891
So many against one?

01:14:43.975 --> 01:14:45.516
-Sir, shall we make a move?
-Let's see first.

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:52.183
Don't run!

01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:54.975
Die!

01:14:58.141 --> 01:14:59.516
Hey, Sing is in trouble!

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.600
-Let's help him.
-Help him!

01:15:08.475 --> 01:15:09.350
Let's move.

01:15:11.683 --> 01:15:14.016
-Cops! Run! The cops are here!
-The cops are here!

01:15:17.725 --> 01:15:19.600
-Sing, are you all right?
-I'm fine.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.516
Sir, the fighting is
in full swing over there.

01:15:22.308 --> 01:15:24.391
-What are you doing?
-Come with us to the police station.

01:15:28.766 --> 01:15:30.391
How are you? Are you all right?

01:15:30.558 --> 01:15:32.225
-I think I'm fine.
-Go home and rest.

01:15:33.308 --> 01:15:34.850
-Are you two all right?
-Yes.

01:15:35.016 --> 01:15:36.391
-Have you seen Chow Sing-sing?
-No.

01:15:36.558 --> 01:15:38.266
No? Go home and rest.

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:42.183
-Have you seen Chow Sing-sing?
-No, Ms. Ho.

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:46.600
Talk to my lawyer if you need anything.

01:15:46.683 --> 01:15:48.808
-Siu-gwai.
-Miss, it hurts!

01:15:48.933 --> 01:15:50.141
Have you seen Chow Sing-sing?

01:15:50.725 --> 01:15:52.808
No, I don't know where they've taken him.

01:15:53.058 --> 01:15:55.058
-Hong, have you seen Inspector Wong?
-What's the matter?

01:15:55.141 --> 01:15:57.641
Inspector Wong? He...

01:15:58.433 --> 01:15:59.266
Hey.

01:15:59.433 --> 01:16:00.766
I'm not obligated to say anything,

01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:02.933
but whatever I say may be
used as evidence.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.350
I have the right to call my lawyer
and have some milk tea,

01:16:05.433 --> 01:16:06.850
but you have no right to hang me up.

01:16:11.391 --> 01:16:12.891
-It stinks.
-Let go.

01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:18.475
You dare to touch me?

01:16:20.141 --> 01:16:21.933
You want to hit my feet?
You think I'm a newcomer?

01:16:27.725 --> 01:16:30.100
Good, come on. Hit my head instead.

01:16:30.183 --> 01:16:32.433
Let's see who dies first. Come on.

01:16:33.391 --> 01:16:34.225
Sure.

01:16:38.808 --> 01:16:40.558
Let's see if I can hit you this time.

01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:42.766
-Miss, you can't go inside.
-Hey!

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.308
How are you? Are you all right?

01:16:46.391 --> 01:16:48.433
What are you doing?
Beating one of your own?

01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:49.516
-Actually--
-Hey.

01:16:49.975 --> 01:16:51.350
Why are you here?

01:16:51.975 --> 01:16:52.808
You're crazy!

01:16:52.891 --> 01:16:54.433
-You're beating one of your own.
-Hey.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.975
-I have something important to tell you.
-Let me finish.

01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:00.391
Actually, he's a--

01:17:06.891 --> 01:17:07.850
Stop!

01:17:12.058 --> 01:17:13.766
Sing-sing, are you all right?

01:17:16.433 --> 01:17:18.058
Ask if his hand is all right.

01:17:19.058 --> 01:17:21.058
-Go home and rub some medicinal oil
-What are you saying?

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:23.308
-or your bones might break.
-Are you leaving or not?

01:17:23.558 --> 01:17:26.808
They just randomly beat people up.

01:17:27.308 --> 01:17:28.808
Let's go.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.975
Look what happened. It's fine now, go.

01:17:51.641 --> 01:17:54.183
I told you to find a pistol
but you've created such big trouble.

01:17:54.558 --> 01:17:56.266
You will never get a promotion.

01:17:56.641 --> 01:17:58.933
Maybe you don't want a promotion
like him too.

01:17:59.183 --> 01:18:00.933
Go, it's fine now.

01:18:01.016 --> 01:18:02.975
Just take it in stride
and go back to square one.

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.641
-Give us one more chance.
-Chance?

01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.266
I've given you all the chances!

01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:07.891
Did I not give you a chance?

01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:10.516
-Did I not give you a chance?
-I'm not the one who said that.

01:18:10.766 --> 01:18:11.725
You're dead.

01:18:11.808 --> 01:18:13.641
We'll die together
if you can't find the pistol.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:19.141
It's really Scissors Legs!

01:18:27.975 --> 01:18:28.808
Hey.

01:18:29.558 --> 01:18:31.475
There's no need to be unhappy.

01:18:32.766 --> 01:18:34.308
You have no idea
how much I'm enjoying this.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.891
Hey, when is your birthday?

01:19:28.183 --> 01:19:30.266
October 22nd.
Are you throwing a party for me?

01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:32.975
No, mine is January 4th.

01:19:33.391 --> 01:19:35.808
Remember, my name is Tso Tat-wah.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.600
-You're setting up a banquet?
-No.

01:19:38.933 --> 01:19:40.933
This time, it's either you or me.

01:19:41.016 --> 01:19:43.683
The one left should write the name
on the memorial tablet for the other.

01:19:44.641 --> 01:19:46.016
Can you make it more explicit?

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.058
The firearms.

01:19:48.225 --> 01:19:51.141
I've long known
where Tai Fei keeps his firearms.

01:19:51.641 --> 01:19:54.308
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?
-I'm scared, man.

01:19:54.558 --> 01:19:56.475
Don't call me "man." Call me "sir"!

01:19:58.891 --> 01:20:00.933
Do you know the consequences
of withholding information?

01:20:01.516 --> 01:20:02.558
So why didn't you tell us?

01:20:02.641 --> 01:20:03.933
-I'm afraid, sir.
-Me too.

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:05.641
-See?
-But as cops,

01:20:05.725 --> 01:20:07.016
we must do our best even if we die.

01:20:07.641 --> 01:20:09.266
Do you want to be
an undercover cop forever?

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:10.266
Yes.

01:20:10.975 --> 01:20:11.891
What?

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:17.350
Well, it's fun.

01:20:20.058 --> 01:20:23.558
Aren't I going to die with you now?

01:20:27.516 --> 01:20:29.141
Stand straight and look at me.

01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:32.433
I'm going to kiss you.

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:39.641
Son of a bitch.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.266
Is it this car park?

01:20:56.433 --> 01:20:57.933
-It's here.
-Which truck is it?

01:20:58.183 --> 01:21:00.475
-How do I know?
-What should we do then?

01:21:00.683 --> 01:21:02.100
Look inside every vehicle.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:04.058
You're so stupid.

01:21:07.641 --> 01:21:08.683
Hey, what are you doing?

01:21:10.808 --> 01:21:12.725
-Hey, go and take a look.
-Go.

01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:17.558
Go in and check.

01:21:19.933 --> 01:21:21.891
-Do you see anything?
-Nothing.

01:21:22.058 --> 01:21:23.308
Why was there noise then?

01:21:23.475 --> 01:21:24.475
Check around.

01:21:45.516 --> 01:21:46.558
This is great.

01:21:50.266 --> 01:21:51.641
They're all long guns.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600
This one is short.

01:22:07.641 --> 01:22:09.766
Yes, this is a cop's pistol.
This is the one.

01:22:11.141 --> 01:22:13.308
-What are you doing?
-I'm bringing them to the station.

01:22:13.475 --> 01:22:15.766
We'll drive the vehicle away.
Put them down.

01:22:22.225 --> 01:22:23.933
-Done?
-Yes.

01:22:25.641 --> 01:22:26.891
I haven't gotten in the truck.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.100
I haven't gotten in the truck!

01:22:29.308 --> 01:22:32.308
Hey! I haven't gotten in the truck!

01:22:33.933 --> 01:22:35.641
Hey!

01:22:53.141 --> 01:22:55.350
Sir, time to wake up and pee.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:57.933
I'll show you something great afterwards.

01:23:00.808 --> 01:23:03.308
You woke me up so early.
Don't tell me there's nothing to see.

01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:05.350
-Of course there is something great.
-Something great?

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:06.850
Keep it well.

01:23:10.058 --> 01:23:12.933
I never thought I'd get it back.
You're smart.

01:23:13.808 --> 01:23:15.933
-Don't cry first. There's more.
-More?

01:23:16.016 --> 01:23:17.141
Hey, wake up.

01:23:23.058 --> 01:23:24.266
Where did you find them?

01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:28.058
You got them before my retirement.

01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:29.600
This is awesome.

01:23:29.975 --> 01:23:31.558
I can be the governor if I don't retire.

01:23:33.391 --> 01:23:34.975
Wait a bit more.

01:23:35.266 --> 01:23:36.516
Chow Sing-sing.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.266
You dare to take my firearms?

01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:41.100
Want to hear your dad's voice?

01:23:42.516 --> 01:23:44.516
Son, I'm fine so far, but--

01:23:45.808 --> 01:23:46.891
Listen.

01:23:47.475 --> 01:23:49.141
If you want to see your dad again,

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.641
meet me at the hill behind the school
in half an hour.

01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:53.641
Remember, no tricks.

01:23:55.141 --> 01:23:57.016
The foreigner is getting impatient.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:59.475
We're calling him already.
Be more patient.

01:23:59.558 --> 01:24:00.683
Tell him to shut up.

01:24:00.808 --> 01:24:02.725
He'll surely see the guns in half an hour!

01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:04.475
Why are you so agitated?

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:08.308
The guns are with me.
Call the SDU if necessary.

01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:09.766
They can handle it.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:11.641
Then Uncle Tat will be
in even more danger.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.225
He's an undercover cop.

01:24:14.475 --> 01:24:16.891
He should have anticipated this
at his age.

01:24:17.725 --> 01:24:20.725
Hey, I know what you want to do.
You want to show off again.

01:24:21.016 --> 01:24:23.891
Don't. I'd rather kill you myself
than let others kill you.

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:24.808
Hey.

01:24:24.891 --> 01:24:27.183
Hey, man. That is a kind pistol.

01:24:27.266 --> 01:24:29.683
Don't. It hasn't been used
for more than 30 years.

01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:31.141
Don't take it. Hey.

01:24:31.225 --> 01:24:32.933
What are you doing? You're driving away?

01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:36.475
Drive away if you dare!

01:24:37.891 --> 01:24:39.600
Don't come back if you dare!

01:24:42.433 --> 01:24:43.975
Youngsters nowadays are so bold.

01:25:11.933 --> 01:25:12.850
Where are the guns?

01:25:20.058 --> 01:25:21.100
Release my dad.

01:25:23.225 --> 01:25:25.058
Take him there to see it.

01:25:27.891 --> 01:25:29.516
Sing-sing, I haven't...

01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:43.308
-The money.
-Hey.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.308
It can't be fired!

01:25:48.391 --> 01:25:50.516
-Is it really that kind?
-Let's go!

01:25:50.641 --> 01:25:51.725
Catch him!

01:25:51.808 --> 01:25:52.975
<i>Why did we come to school?</i>

01:25:53.058 --> 01:25:54.391
You want to endanger your classmates?

01:25:54.475 --> 01:25:56.391
You don't have to tell me.
Today is a public holiday.

01:25:56.475 --> 01:25:58.016
That's even worse. Nobody's here to help.

01:25:59.725 --> 01:26:01.475
-Higher.
-Hey.

01:26:01.558 --> 01:26:03.016
Why are you playing around? Stop.

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.391
What? Playing with air guns again?
Aren't you helping out?

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:07.516
Hold this. Help out.

01:26:08.016 --> 01:26:08.975
You too.

01:26:09.225 --> 01:26:11.350
You should help. Come on.

01:26:11.516 --> 01:26:13.725
-Stop playing.
-Hey, what happened to Sing?

01:26:13.808 --> 01:26:15.058
He said he'd come to help.

01:26:15.141 --> 01:26:16.808
He still hasn't shown up.

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:20.475
No, I think Sing must have been arrested
by the police.

01:26:20.641 --> 01:26:22.058
You're silly. That's impossible.

01:26:22.225 --> 01:26:24.350
-Ms. Ho has seen him.
-Really?

01:26:25.016 --> 01:26:26.641
-Ms. Ho!
-Not like that.

01:26:26.808 --> 01:26:28.433
Is Sing all right?

01:26:28.891 --> 01:26:29.933
He's fine.

01:26:30.266 --> 01:26:32.808
I told you. Get back to work.
Stop spouting nonsense.

01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:36.933
Hey, you look pale. Are you all right?

01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:38.600
I'm fine.

01:26:39.016 --> 01:26:41.683
-There are so many people here.
-Why are you here? Today is a holiday.

01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:44.350
-Leave, it's dangerous.
-Leave quickly!

01:26:44.808 --> 01:26:46.475
How can Uncle Tat run that fast?

01:26:54.266 --> 01:26:56.016
-Stick closer to me.
-Wait for me.

01:26:58.308 --> 01:26:59.683
-No.
-This is bad.

01:26:59.766 --> 01:27:01.641
-Move. Quick.
-What?

01:27:01.933 --> 01:27:03.850
-Have you seen Chow Sing-sing?
-I don't know.

01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:05.058
He's in the maze.

01:27:05.225 --> 01:27:07.308
-Why are you looking for him?
-It's none of your business!

01:27:07.391 --> 01:27:08.225
Move!

01:27:08.975 --> 01:27:09.975
Move.

01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:12.100
Keep an eye on the students.

01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:14.225
Monkey, come here.

01:27:17.279 --> 01:27:18.763
MAZE: PARTICIPANTS OF THE PEACE TOUR,

01:27:18.914 --> 01:27:20.799
IF YOU'RE TRAPPED INSIDE
AND CAN'T MOVE FORWARD,

01:27:20.948 --> 01:27:21.990
PLEASE SHOUT FOR HELP!

01:27:23.891 --> 01:27:24.808
Over there.

01:27:29.433 --> 01:27:31.475
Hey. What do you want?

01:27:31.725 --> 01:27:33.100
That's none of your business. Shut up.

01:27:34.683 --> 01:27:35.766
Pretty girl.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.933
What? Are you scared?

01:27:41.725 --> 01:27:43.725
This way, you won't be scared.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:48.391
Tie him up!

01:27:48.475 --> 01:27:50.641
-Tie him up!
-You scum!

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.225
-Done.
-Done.

01:27:53.516 --> 01:27:55.600
-Ms. Leung, call the police. Hurry.
-All right.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.391
Let's go and save Sing.

01:27:58.558 --> 01:28:00.141
Don't. They've got guns.

01:28:00.766 --> 01:28:01.933
I've got one too.

01:28:02.016 --> 01:28:04.016
-Hey. Don't!
-I've got one too!

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.225
-Hey!
-Don't stop us!

01:28:05.308 --> 01:28:06.475
Don't go.

01:28:08.975 --> 01:28:10.475
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Want to die?

01:28:19.641 --> 01:28:20.850
Follow me.

01:28:24.391 --> 01:28:27.433
-Hey, wait.
-Hurry!

01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:31.933
You go first.

01:28:43.766 --> 01:28:46.058
That's the entrance, genius.

01:28:46.141 --> 01:28:47.683
How would I know?
Every door looks the same.

01:28:47.766 --> 01:28:49.641
That's why you have to follow me, stupid.

01:28:58.725 --> 01:28:59.766
Here we are.

01:29:00.266 --> 01:29:01.183
Gosh.

01:29:03.016 --> 01:29:04.183
Go and call our boss right away.

01:29:04.266 --> 01:29:05.350
What about you?

01:29:05.475 --> 01:29:07.391
A lot of kids are there.
How can I leave them?

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:08.933
But the pistol doesn't work.

01:29:09.266 --> 01:29:10.391
I can manage.

01:29:10.641 --> 01:29:11.808
No, I must stay and help you.

01:29:11.891 --> 01:29:14.058
Seek help outside!
How old are you? Help me?

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:15.433
Hey...

01:29:23.141 --> 01:29:24.183
So? Have you seen him?

01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:25.183
No.

01:29:26.141 --> 01:29:27.975
Kin, go that way. The rest, follow me.

01:29:28.058 --> 01:29:28.975
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:54.141
-Hey, keep turning left.
-Go ahead.

01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:59.683
Keep turning left.

01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:01.933
Little boy, don't move.

01:30:06.641 --> 01:30:07.641
I told you not to move.

01:30:15.933 --> 01:30:17.350
-Go, quickly.
-Go!

01:30:19.058 --> 01:30:21.308
-Fai got shot.
-Take him away.

01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:22.433
Hurry.

01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:25.100
Go, hurry. Damn it.

01:30:26.558 --> 01:30:28.350
Let's go. Do you want to die?

01:30:28.766 --> 01:30:30.558
Over there. That way.

01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:32.183
You're leaving?

01:30:32.391 --> 01:30:33.725
You damn kid.

01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:36.516
Get down!

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:39.766
-Hey. That way.
-Don't move!

01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:40.766
Go.

01:30:41.933 --> 01:30:43.475
-Hurry.
-I'll kill you with one shot.

01:30:57.808 --> 01:30:58.933
Move!

01:31:13.141 --> 01:31:14.225
Nothing again?

01:31:15.225 --> 01:31:16.933
You're dead
and you didn't even leave me one?

01:31:17.766 --> 01:31:19.183
Why are you so cruel?

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:23.516
-Sing.
-Sing.

01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:27.058
-No!
-Don't move!

01:31:27.141 --> 01:31:28.350
Chow Sing-sing, listen up.

01:31:29.808 --> 01:31:31.225
I have the kids.

01:31:31.808 --> 01:31:33.350
I'll give you five minutes.

01:31:33.725 --> 01:31:35.308
If you don't come out, I'll kill them all.

01:31:35.433 --> 01:31:38.058
This is bad, Sing. They really mean it.

01:31:38.433 --> 01:31:41.016
-I'll go and deal with them.
-Hey.

01:31:43.058 --> 01:31:44.141
Stop it.

01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:46.266
Don't make a sound.

01:31:46.433 --> 01:31:48.016
Calm down.

01:31:48.225 --> 01:31:50.725
Do you hear me?

01:31:55.225 --> 01:31:56.475
What do you do best?

01:31:56.850 --> 01:31:58.600
This is bad. We'll really die this time.

01:31:58.683 --> 01:32:00.308
Damn you. Shut up now!

01:32:03.558 --> 01:32:06.141
Listen. What do you do best?

01:32:08.266 --> 01:32:09.391
Flirting with girls.

01:32:11.183 --> 01:32:12.725
What else besides flirting with girls?

01:32:12.975 --> 01:32:13.850
Nothing.

01:32:13.933 --> 01:32:15.350
You're best at having fun.

01:32:15.683 --> 01:32:17.475
You flirt with girls
because you want to have fun.

01:32:17.558 --> 01:32:18.891
Is it because you want to get married?

01:32:19.808 --> 01:32:21.891
Okay, let's have fun with them.

01:32:22.475 --> 01:32:25.600
Let's treat this as a game.
But we can't lose this game.

01:32:25.808 --> 01:32:27.183
Otherwise, somebody will die.

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.683
-Isn't it exciting?
-Yes.

01:32:29.766 --> 01:32:31.891
-Have you played such a game before?
-No.

01:32:31.975 --> 01:32:34.391
Let me tell you.
The chance of us losing is zero.

01:32:34.808 --> 01:32:36.600
All we have to do is cooperate
with each other.

01:32:36.808 --> 01:32:39.100
I'm the supervisor and you two
will listen to my instructions.

01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:42.016
Right now,
we are in the most favorable situation.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:43.266
We'll surely win.

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:45.975
The most important thing is confidence.

01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.350
Are you confident?

01:32:49.641 --> 01:32:50.475
Are you?

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:52.558
Are you confident?

01:32:53.225 --> 01:32:54.225
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:32:56.225 --> 01:32:57.100
Let's move!

01:33:08.808 --> 01:33:09.933
There are six of them.

01:33:10.558 --> 01:33:12.058
Do you have any weapons? Give it to me.

01:33:12.183 --> 01:33:13.016
An air gun.

01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:14.391
-I don't want an air gun.
-Here.

01:33:14.641 --> 01:33:16.558
-I said I don't want air guns.
-This is a real gun.

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:19.391
There are five bullets left.

01:33:20.475 --> 01:33:22.558
-Only five bullets?
-Chow Sing-sing.

01:33:22.808 --> 01:33:24.266
Come out quickly.

01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:26.725
Let's take a gamble.
Synchronize our watches.

01:33:28.808 --> 01:33:30.891
Good. Let's go according to plan,
are we clear?

01:33:32.391 --> 01:33:33.975
-Chow Sing-sing, come out!
-I'm so scared.

01:33:34.725 --> 01:33:37.433
-Come out!
-I'm so scared.

01:33:37.516 --> 01:33:39.266
Fine. Do you think I'm kidding?

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:43.100
Did you hear that?

01:33:43.475 --> 01:33:44.933
I'll kill them one by one.

01:33:45.558 --> 01:33:46.766
You have 20 seconds left.

01:33:51.891 --> 01:33:53.433
What? You're not coming out?

01:33:55.391 --> 01:33:57.100
Come out!

01:33:57.975 --> 01:33:59.808
Or I'll kill them one by one.

01:34:00.266 --> 01:34:02.641
-Shut up!
-You're so noisy!

01:34:03.641 --> 01:34:04.683
Shut up!

01:34:05.308 --> 01:34:06.433
Shut up!

01:34:06.725 --> 01:34:07.850
You're not coming out?

01:34:09.933 --> 01:34:10.933
Come out!

01:34:11.308 --> 01:34:12.683
You want me to blow their heads off?

01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:15.516
-You want me to do it?
-No...

01:34:16.891 --> 01:34:17.933
You don't think I'll do it?

01:34:21.683 --> 01:34:22.600
Fine!

01:34:44.141 --> 01:34:45.725
Go. Hurry!

01:34:45.891 --> 01:34:47.100
Let's go.

01:34:50.475 --> 01:34:52.100
Shoot!

01:34:53.808 --> 01:34:55.183
Shoot if you dare.

01:34:55.391 --> 01:34:57.475
-I'm afraid you don't have the guts.
-That's fine.

01:34:57.641 --> 01:34:59.141
She'll die first.

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.016
Go ahead. So what?

01:35:01.183 --> 01:35:02.350
You're using her as your shield?

01:35:02.516 --> 01:35:03.891
You'll be shot however you hide.

01:35:03.975 --> 01:35:05.808
You saw what happened to them. Come on.

01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:08.891
Are you trying to scare me?

01:35:09.433 --> 01:35:11.808
-I can kill you with only one shot!
-Do it. Go ahead.

01:35:11.891 --> 01:35:13.891
-Come on!
-Let's fire at the count of three.

01:35:13.975 --> 01:35:16.683
-Sure, count. One, two...
-One, two, three.

01:35:16.766 --> 01:35:18.183
Okay, I'm sorry, it's my fault.

01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:19.808
I told you. You're no match for me.

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.100
-Why are you so serious?
-Put your gun down.

01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:28.266
Stand back.

01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:36.975
-Where's the money?
-It's not with me.

01:35:37.266 --> 01:35:38.308
Where's the money?

01:35:38.683 --> 01:35:40.683
-Where's the money?
-Here's the money.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.350
-Put your gun down!
-You dare to do that?

01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:45.516
Or I'll burn all the money.

01:35:45.808 --> 01:35:47.016
Let's all die together!

01:35:47.683 --> 01:35:48.975
Hey, got a lighter?

01:35:49.933 --> 01:35:51.558
-You don't have one?
-No, how about you?

01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:55.516
No!

01:35:56.891 --> 01:35:59.141
Tai Fei, can I borrow your lighter?

01:36:01.141 --> 01:36:02.183
Tai Fei!

01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:04.975
Tai Fei! Be careful, let's go.

01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:13.683
-He's so cool!
-He's so cool!

01:36:22.891 --> 01:36:24.100
How dare you fire back at me?

01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:25.891
Come out at once!

01:36:36.433 --> 01:36:37.558
Want to kill me?

01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:39.850
Come out.

01:36:40.683 --> 01:36:41.725
Come out!

01:36:44.391 --> 01:36:45.308
Don't fire!

01:36:45.391 --> 01:36:46.308
Put your gun down!

01:36:48.225 --> 01:36:49.141
Sir!

01:36:58.766 --> 01:36:59.600
Catch!

01:37:02.225 --> 01:37:03.058
Die!

01:37:09.183 --> 01:37:11.433
Hey, I'm not the leader of the Star Gang.

01:37:11.641 --> 01:37:13.516
I'm a cop.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.683
My nickname is Killer Scissors Legs.

01:37:16.975 --> 01:37:18.141
Remember that!

01:37:21.558 --> 01:37:22.433
Sir.

01:37:22.891 --> 01:37:24.266
You threw my pistol.

01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:25.516
You'll scratch it.

01:37:26.641 --> 01:37:27.975
I had no choice.

01:37:28.266 --> 01:37:30.016
Your pistol doesn't work!

01:37:30.933 --> 01:37:33.308
I told you this is a kind pistol.

01:37:33.433 --> 01:37:34.766
You want to use it to kill?

01:37:35.225 --> 01:37:36.183
Gosh.

01:37:36.266 --> 01:37:38.141
But you're good. That was a good throw.

01:37:38.308 --> 01:37:39.933
Your police training wasn't in vain.

01:37:40.016 --> 01:37:43.141
The Police Academy didn't teach me that.
I learned it in school.

01:37:44.975 --> 01:37:45.891
Hey.

01:37:46.308 --> 01:37:49.141
The guys are coming.
I'm leaving. I was never here.

01:37:49.308 --> 01:37:50.975
Take care of this, Chief Inspector Chow.

01:37:52.016 --> 01:37:53.350
-What are you doing?
-Chief Inspector?

01:37:53.516 --> 01:37:54.725
If I say so, then you are.

01:37:55.391 --> 01:37:56.225
Hey.

01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:57.766
Shouldn't I be the Chief Superintendent?

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.516
Sing.

01:38:37.725 --> 01:38:39.600
Come back for tea when you have time.

01:38:40.641 --> 01:38:42.600
-Come back.
-We'll miss you.

01:38:54.808 --> 01:38:57.183
This mobile phone is yours. Call me.

01:38:58.391 --> 01:39:00.391
I'll come at once when my pager rings.

01:39:00.808 --> 01:39:02.225
-Take care.
-Take care.

01:39:02.308 --> 01:39:03.725
-Bye.
-Bye. Take care.

01:39:09.475 --> 01:39:12.058
-Sing, you're so lucky!
-Sing, you're so lucky!

01:39:12.641 --> 01:39:13.641
Yes!

01:39:13.725 --> 01:39:15.600
-What are you waiting for?
-What are you waiting for?
