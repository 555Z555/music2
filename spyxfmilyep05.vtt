WEBVTT

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.980
It's today, isn't it?

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.680
Hm? What is?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.240
What, you say...

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.860
The results announcement of
Eden College entrance exam.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.200
It should be displayed
today at 1200 hours.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.560
This is making me nervous...

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.600
My bracelet just came off...
Why today, of all days...

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.640
It's just a coincidence.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.170
L-Loid, look...

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.260
Oh, come on, Yor. Black cats
equal bad luck is just a superstition.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.240
Y-You're right.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.480
Father.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.140
What's wrong?

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.680
Anya...

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.060
...stepped on a poo...

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.690
The results announcement of
Eden College entrance exam?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.940
Oh, the thing agent Twilight is doing, huh?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.780
Director, the course of peace between
East and West depends on Operation Strix,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.700
so you should take it more seriously.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.040
You've never met him before, have you?

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.830
N-No...

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.910
He's considered the best spy in Westalis.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.710
So don't worry so much.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.050
Soon, he'll report that the
"cherry blossoms are blooming".

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.670
What's that?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.930
It's an oriental cypher.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060
It means "passing an exam".

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.780
I can't find it...

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.870
In this world like nuts packed in a bag,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.750
Everyone is snuggling up
to someone they meet

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.880
We are mixed in there and smiling

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.550
By pretending we are
all nuts like peanuts

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.470
On the template of happiness,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.020
Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.230
We can't be as we are,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.570
Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.660
Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.700
Even though I chew up
the real emotions,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.870
they still don't disappear

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.460
They are still stuck in my teeth

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.460
My life is so insecure and drifting,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.670
And I know

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.090
Every day is so mediocre,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.890
but I'm here and so are you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.270
Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.980
(Mission: 5 - Pass or Fail?)

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.760
We failed...

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.610
We failed...

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.490
We failed...

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.720
L-Let's go home now, okay?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.620
I-I'll brew us some tea.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.600
I'm sorry...

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.880
It's because Anya stepped on poo!

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.100
Hold it right there, Forger.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.880
Hm?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.800
Mr. Henderson!

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.260
What is this?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.010
Look at the very top of the list.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.310
Anya Forger...

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.100
Those are the candidates
on the waiting list.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.390
It's confidential, though.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.710
Waiting list?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.920
Correct. The overall scoring...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.360
...placed Anya Forger
in first place on the waiting list.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.500
If even one of the officially
accepted candidates withdraws,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.910
she'll get an immediate pass.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.080
B-But...

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.160
We did something
horrible back there...

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.840
Can you guess which creature
kills the most humans on the planet?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.460
Huh?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.200
Mosquitoes.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.250
Yes. You have saved Mr. Swan from
that dangerous creature back there.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.390
This has scored you big points.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.110
That's too much of a stretch...

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.680
You should be proud, Forger.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.140
You're all worthy of joining our school.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.590
If even one candidate withdraws,
Anya will pass...

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.900
Correct.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.600
But what if no one withdraws...?!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.330
About that...

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.060
Th-Thorn Princess?!
Why are you here?!

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.350
You are Secretary Ekeniel, right?

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.990
May I have the honour of taking your life?

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.120
Stop! Please spare me!

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.600
I have a son that will soon turn six!

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.200
He'll be going to Eden next month!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.010
If I die, he won't be able
to go to school anymore!

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.420
I'm sorry, but that's exactly my intention.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.970
Huh?!

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.520
For Anya's admission...

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.300
...please die!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.260
Ahh!

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.060
Wait, wait, wait! No way!

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.940
You can't lay your hands
on someone innocent, Yor!

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.680
Yor?

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.200
I-It's nothing.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.620
I'm sorry, Mr. Ekeniel...

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.170
Heh...

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.320
Well, after all...

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.120
There are always a few who
withdraw their admission every year.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.730
Make sure you're well-prepared for that.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.330
Thank you very much, Sir!

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.960
I may be removed from teaching
by the entrance ceremony, though.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.630
Huh?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.010
After I hit that headmaster's
fat son in the face.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.110
- What kind of retribution awaits me now...
- That foolish man and this teacher...

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.670
I can't tell which one of them
will be most useful for the mission,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.520
but if he becomes an obstacle,
there are many ways to kill him socially.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.270
Let us know if there's
anything we can help with.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.330
I appreciate your sentiment, Elegant Boy.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.440
Well, just go home and wait for the news there.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.330
(3 Days Later)
Well, just go home and wait for the news there.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.350
Anya will pass!

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.450
Anya will pass!

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.740
- Anya will pass!

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.040
- What is she doing?
- Anya will pass!

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.820
- Looks like she's doing
- Anya will pass!

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.660
- Looks like she's doing
- Anya will pass!

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.520
- a ritual dance to make her pass.
- Anya will pass!

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.250
- Oh, really...
- Yeah!

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.070
Forger residence.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.480
Yes...

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.940
Excuse me.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.760
We passed!

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.360
Father! Anya passed!

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.220
Well done, Anya!

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.200
Yay!

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.900
That's great!
I'm so happy as well!

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.090
Thank you as well, Yor!

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.670
Heya! So you passed the exam?
Let's have a drink, then!

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.270
How'd you catch wind so quick?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.570
I don't work as an
informant just for show, Bro.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.830
Oh, hello, Ma'am!
Nice to meet you!

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.250
I'm Franky, Loid's best friend!

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.300
Hello!

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.470
Curly guy!

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.840
This calls for a celebration!

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.330
I've got some booze here,
and ordered some food, too!

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.270
You and your selfish act...

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.520
It's all thanks to me
stealing the answer sheets, huh?

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.480
Idiot! They'll hear you!

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.840
Huh~? What did you say~?

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.380
Bro, you're not drinking enough, eh?

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.290
Beat it.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.700
Good for you, Anya.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.850
Your papa just said he'll
do anything for you now!

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.140
Hey! Don't promise things on my behalf!

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.130
Anya wants to do something instead!

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.710
Hm? What is it?

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.500
Well, as long as it's within my power.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.680
Help me, Bondman!

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.130
Good morning, Bondman.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.175
Your mission is to rescue Princess Honey,

00:07:33.177 --> 00:07:35.760
who has been kidnapped by
the League of Evil,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.940
and liberate the castle.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.460
Wait for me, Princess Honey!

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.150
Bondman, the best spy in
the kingdom, infiltrates the castle.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.150
While destroying every enemy in his path,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.030
he finally reaches the princess.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.730
I've come to save you, Princess Honey!

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.290
Bondman!

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.620
They begin to nurture their love,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.070
- all while restoring peace to the castle...

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.820
- Anya wants to do this.
- all while restoring peace to the castle...

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.870
So you want to do...

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.310
Play the princess in a castle!

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.220
Nope, not a chance.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.330
You're a meanie, Father!

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.560
If you don't want to do it,
I won't go to school!

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.180
Don't speak for her.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.340
But isn't this the
Newston Castle they're using?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.400
I heard they've turned it into a theme park
for a cartoon recently, so this must be it.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.940
There's talks about the castle
having the same set-ups as in the show,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.240
and we can rent it, too.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.500
Now, the area around there is clear
of the government's sniffing,

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.060
so it won't hurt to have a little
fun there, you know, Mr. Loid?

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.040
But...

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.660
Your daughter went and
passed the exam for you, though...

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.880
She could use a celebration
or two to go on, you know?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.040
Ugh...

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.630
All right.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.540
Sweet!
Let's strike while the iron's hot!

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.850
I'll handle the booking,
so you handle the transport!

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.060
Wait, we're going today?!
And I have to prepare too?!

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.170
Well, duh!
It's for your daughter's sake, isn't it?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.600
A transmission from Twilight.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.070
Code GO005.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.970
He did it.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.280
The cherry blossoms are blowing.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.740
Another transmission from Twilight.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.450
What is it?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.170
What should we do?

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.340
He's considered the best spy in Westalis.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.990
See to it right away!

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.700
Roger!

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.430
To Falcon, Rynech District.
We have an important case from Twilight.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.890
This is Falcon.
Solid copy on the important case. Over.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.750
Gather at the lower reaches of the River
Nine, Rynech District at 1830 hours.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.720
That's a quick response.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.300
We can do stuff like this
in the castle, you know!

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.210
Anya will make a quiz!

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.700
Oh, that's a great idea!

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.180
You rock, Bro!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.990
- This is Anya's first time on a plane!

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.450
- This is sooo epic, wow!
- This is Anya's first time on a plane!

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.660
- This is sooo epic, wow!
- I can't wait!

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.140
This should do it.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.190
Does Anya look cool in this?

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.880
Yes, you do.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.540
Loid!

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.670
Where did you get this mini plane?

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.460
It's so awesome!

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.630
Oh, these nice colleagues
of mine lent it to me. Hahaha.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.690
Thank you for always
taking care of my husband.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.770
Put on your seat belts, people.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.010
We're taking off now.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.150
Let's go!

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.920
Whoa! Anya's so excited!

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.570
Yahoo!

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.090
Wow! So pretty!

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.910
They look like treasure boxes!

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.050
Father's so amazing!

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.220
Hey! I can see it now!

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.260
Oh, wow!

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.880
- The castle's so cool!

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.780
- Hey, stay put!
- The castle's so cool!

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.330
I'm going to land this plane, so sit down.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.530
A castle!

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.200
Don't get so excited yourself!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.770
Good for them, right!

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:23.880
What's wrong?

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.770
This is wrong.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.500
What do you mean?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.490
A castle without the enemy
and their servants...

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.000
...is not a castle.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.180
Anya's so sad.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.510
I don't think I can go to school now...

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.610
Yeah, I guess.
No one can blame you for that.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.810
Papa's got to do something
about this, right?

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.310
A transmission from Twilight!

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.480
He's requesting for more agents,
as many as we can get.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.960
It's a test of our strength, huh?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.740
Attention, all agents in Ostania.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.990
Participate in an emergency
mission at Newston Castle.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.750
This is the most critical
agenda for Operation Strix!

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.740
Mission rank: SS+!

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.950
Repeat, this is the most
critical agenda for Operation Strix!

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.210
Mission rank: SS+!

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.710
So that's the real Twilight?

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.890
I should get his signature later.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.760
So you guys can pull off this kind of
stunt when you're being wise, huh!

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.520
All right, you tell them
what's going on now.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.170
I'll fill them in later.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.480
Huh...

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.440
All right.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.980
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for gathering tonight for my daughter.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.360
A Morse code?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.190
"Just listen as you are."

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.910
An instruction from the Twilight!

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.490
I want you all to play the role of enemies...

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.240
(Note that this mission is related)
I want you all to play the role of enemies...

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.240
(to the execution of Operation Strix,)
...of the spy wanting to rescue the princess.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.500
(so there's no need for unnecessary prying.)
I don't really know what he's talking about...

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.290
But we're talking about Twilight here.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.250
This mission must possess a tactical agenda.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.880
(That man you saw earlier will fill you in.)
I would be happy if you could cooperate

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.340
(You will follow his instructions after this.)
for my daughter's sake.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.440
All right, time to announce
the cast for the show!

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.860
Let's start with the main cast for today!

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.340
Princess Anya!

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.900
And the spy that will rescue Anya!

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.730
Loidman!

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.680
- The boss of the League of Evil,

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.480
- Kerleeh!
- The boss of the League of Evil,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.990
- Kerleeh!
- Professor Curly!

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.750
And Mother... Uh...

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.990
She's nobody.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.160
Shock!

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.560
Also...

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.450
You guys, the skilled minions
of Professor Curly!

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.450
I urge you all
to play the role as those...

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.270
...who will spawn great difficulties
in Loidman's path!

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.500
Huh? But...

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.760
The mission rank is SS+...

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.700
We must clear the mission,
no matter the sacrifices!

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.790
It's the real deal
if we're up against Twilight!

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.980
The time's finally come...

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.360
I'll leave it to you guys to
devise the plan to stop Loidman!

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.780
It's no exaggeration...

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.150
...that the fate of this
operation lies in your hands!

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.400
He's going too far...

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.980
My minions!

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.570
Make sure Loidman suffers
for Princess Anya, kerleeh!

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.240
Yes!

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.920
Get into position as soon as you're ready!

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.870
Roger!

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.930
Kerleeheheheh!

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.930
I'll be taking Princess Anya with me!

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.280
If you want her back,
you'll have to catch me!

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.020
Help me, Loidman~

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.800
Huh? We're starting already?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.640
Heeey!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.240
Loidman!

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.270
I'll make sure you face so many hardships
in taking back Princess Anya now!

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.310
And now...

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.290
I'm going to give you a quiz devised
by the princess right here, so listen up!

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.770
If you can't answer,
you'll have to put those on!

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.090
Are these...

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.400
- Yes! The Bondman costume set!

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.500
- So exciting!
- Yes! The Bondman costume set!

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.250
Here comes a question now!

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.880
What does Anya like about Bondman?!

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.090
Huh? His face?

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.370
Buzz!

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.210
Anya likes the part where he uses
his pistol that doesn't make a sound!

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.170
Huh? That's what you like?

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:09.910
Hey, hey! You suck at being her
parent if you don't know that!

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.430
Next!

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.230
What's Anya's favourite food?!

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.010
Peanuts!

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.020
Correct!

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.110
Tch! Guess it was too easy, huh!

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.270
Here comes the last question!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.290
If you can't answer this one, you'll have
to change to that costume, Loidman!

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.280
If I can't answer, that is.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.280
Here it comes, then.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.860
What does Anya want now?

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.840
What does she want now?

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.290
Five!

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.890
Four!

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.790
You didn't tell me anything
about time limit!

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.250
I never said there's none, either.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.590
Calm down...
What Anya wants...

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.850
What Anya wants...

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.300
Oh!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.470
Bondman's spy merchandise!

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.130
Princess Anya! What's the correct answer?!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.750
What Anya wants now...

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.860
...is water,
because Anya's thirsty!

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.100
You got it wrong, Loidman!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.620
- How could I tell?!

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.840
- Kerleeheheheh!
- How could I tell?!

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.440
Too bad, Loidman!

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.750
You've got to keep your word!

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.120
Anya wants to see it!

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.450
Anya wants to see the perfect Loidman!

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.950
Wow! Loidman!

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.220
All right! Let's move
on to the next stage, then!

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.490
Hey, wait!

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.370
Loidman!

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.080
If you want to save Anya,
come at us, then!

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.910
Kerleeheheheh!

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.000
He's so badass!

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.770
Wow...

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.330
You're so cool, Loidman!

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.080
I'm not done yet, kerleeh!

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.050
Oh, no! Help me!

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.160
What a pain...

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.280
Loidman! Up here!

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.920
Anya's here!

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.430
I can't shake them off...

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.280
Wow, so cool!

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.620
Go for it, my minions! Don't let up!

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.360
Hit him! Hit Loid now!

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.300
Now you've done it, you jerk!

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.680
Don't think you can catch me so easily!

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.530
Nggghh!!

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.820
Oww!

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.150
So long!

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.540
Help me, Loidman!

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.030
You're so awesome, Loidman!

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.260
Kerleeheheheh!
You're finally here, Loidman!

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.870
I'm not handing her over to you!

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.850
Help me!

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.670
Loidman!

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.480
Are you telling me to do this embarrassing
little play in front of all the agents here?!

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.820
But this is for the mission!

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.530
L-Let the princess go.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.960
I can't believe I'm seeing
Twilight's live acting!

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.450
Geh!

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.472
Hahahah! Fool!

00:19:46.472 --> 00:19:48.270
You really think I'd
let her go that easily?!

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.710
Ah!

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.710
Go forth!

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.460
The strongest witch, Yortisia!

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.930
Put that man down, kerleeh!

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.260
Wait, we have a witch here?!

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.220
I don't understand the setting at all!

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.870
Huh? N-No way...

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.620
No one can take Anya away from me...

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.320
Not on my watch...!

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.070
C-Calm down, Yor!

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.160
Why is she using physical
attacks despite being a witch?!

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.120
She's so strong!

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.330
I'm getting pinned down!

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.410
You okay, Yor?

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.760
Kerleeheheheh!

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.730
I commend you
for making it this far, Loidman!

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.680
But don't think you can get through me so—

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.400
Oww...

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.070
So exciting...

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.340
I-I've come to save you,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.110
Princess Anya...

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.750
Father!

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.870
Huh? Am I supposed to be the father here?

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.800
Whoa!

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.800
So sparkling!

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.060
Congratulations, Anya!

Anya...

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.230
Congrats...

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.260
What the heck...

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.280
Anya's had so much fun
since leaving the orphanage!

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.700
Thanks to you!

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.080
Hm?
Oh, that's good to hear.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.460
Anya will work hard at school!

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.330
All right.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.730
Well... For now...

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.590
Congrats on your new school.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.600
Here's the invoice from Twilight.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.760
Are you sure he
didn't get the digits wrong?

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.180
Yes, I'm sure.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.740
- Huh? But...

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.700
- I'm sure!

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.780
On this mischievous planet

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:44.290
I've been an outsider
since the day I was born

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.160
My tears have run dry

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.430
The place I'm going back to is in my dreams

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.800
I met you

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.490
where I came spilling out

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.490
You with all your secrets

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.940
Pretending to be normal

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:10.070
I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:17.620
Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.300
We made a deal that day

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.280
Thicker than blood

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.420
A pact from heart to heart

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.160
Shall we hold hands and head home?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.980
What should we eat tonight?

"Here's what happened today"

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.420
That's what I wanted to talk to you about

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.180
Any and every day is

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.750
A comedy with you

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.590
Dancing on a creaking bed

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.660
