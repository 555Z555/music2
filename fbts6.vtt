00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:46.491
The moon is so pretty.

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:50.925
Sing, whenever the moon is so pretty,
make a wish.

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:52.383
It'll definitely come true.

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.175
-Really?
-Yes!

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:58.716
O moon, I must be an official
when I grow up.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.716
I want to be honorable and arrest
the criminals and corrupt officials.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.966
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:52.050
Who comes this early in the morning?

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.883
Broken drum. Broken board. Broken court.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.758
Go get your rotten official!

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:59.425
How dare you insult His Honor?

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.008
He's just a junior official.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.091
Is he worthy to be insulted by me,
Fong Tong-kan?

00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.550
-Fong Tong-kan?
-Fong Tong-kan?

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:13.716
As in Canton's best lawyer, Mirror Fong?

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:15.966
This is the lawsuit.

00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.716
I represent Mr. Lam
in accusing Wong Lo-chou's wife.

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:22.883
When Mr. Lam went to collect rent,
she was attracted by Mr. Lam

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.591
so she tried to rape Mr. Lam.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:25.716
We're falsely accused!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.383
It was Mr. Lam who wanted to rape my wife
on the pretext of collecting rent.

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:30.925
Where's His Honor?

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:32.800
He went to your grandpa's.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:34.633
Checkmate!

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:37.425
No way, I'll counter you.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.133
Checkmate again.

00:02:39.883 --> 00:02:42.175
Then I'll capture your general.

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:49.258
Don't think that you're so great
now that you've become a magistrate.

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:51.133
How can I compete with you, Dad?

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.133
Do you remember what I told you?

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:58.633
You should be a decent
and honest official.

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:01.050
Dad, but you were a...

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:03.925
Yes, I was a corrupted official.

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.008
My nickname is
"anything can be straightened,

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.466
the dead can be revived."

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:10.800
Since I've done so many bad deeds,

00:03:10.883 --> 00:03:14.800
twelve of your brothers died before me.

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:18.383
Your brothers died one after another.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:24.383
I could do nothing but to retire
and donate all my wealth to charity.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.341
That's why you're alive, Sing.

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:31.841
I wrote this calligraphy for you
to hang on the wall.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:33.758
{\an8}It's the word, honesty.

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:41.133
No matter how I look at it,
the word is clearly poverty.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.383
Uncle! Big trouble!

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.508
-Uncle! Grandpa.
-What's the matter?

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:53.508
-Come, have some sweet potato soup.
-Mom.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.133
It's delicious.

00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:57.550
My ninth son, eat up.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.883
I'm Sing, your 13th son.

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:01.133
Do I have so many sons?

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:04.466
Little boy, who are you looking for?

00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:07.341
I'm your husband.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.216
What about you?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.800
I'm your grandchild, Grandma!

00:04:13.883 --> 00:04:16.133
My lovely little girl, you're so tall now.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.008
Dear, eat now or it'll get cold.

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:21.341
I'm your 13th son, Mom.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:23.300
Uncle, we'll be rich.

00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:25.091
Let Mirror Fong lead the show.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:26.800
We'll take advantage halfway through.

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:28.508
It's a good opportunity indeed.

00:04:28.591 --> 00:04:31.800
I spent so much on this post
just to make money from these cases.

00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:36.425
You despicable son.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.508
I told you not to be a corrupted official.
Why won't you listen to me?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.175
Mirror Fong is the best lawyer in Canton.

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:49.425
Do you think you can go against him?
Don't even dream about it.

00:04:49.508 --> 00:04:50.925
All right, Dad.

00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:52.466
-Let's go.
-Grandpa, we're leaving.

00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:58.425
Sing, you forgot to take my calligraphy.

00:04:58.508 --> 00:05:00.425
I'd rather leave that calligraphy
of poverty with you!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.425
Hey!

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:10.508
Why are you standing?

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:15.758
I'm Fong Tong-kan,
a former recommended person.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:18.216
I needn't kneel in front of you by right.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.133
How cocky you are! You bully the poor
and send shit to others during winter.

00:05:22.216 --> 00:05:24.008
-He may become your superior.
-I don't care now.

00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:25.883
I want to teach you a lesson.

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.216
Thank you.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.675
I've heard that your mom is hospitable.

00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:31.675
Be it the locals or foreigners,
she won't mind.

00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:33.800
I know that you call everyone "godfather."

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:36.008
I'd like to learn it.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:37.133
You're welcome.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:38.508
But my mom is really hospitable.

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.383
No, he means your mom is a hooker.

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.508
Do you mean my mom is a hooker?

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:46.716
Well, when did you see me
sending shit to others during winter?

00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.008
That was only a metaphor.

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:53.383
Well, it was only a metaphor
of your mom's friendliness.

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:56.008
I don't call everyone godfather.

00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:57.508
-You--
-I don't know that yet.

00:05:58.008 --> 00:06:01.675
But Wong Lo-chou's wife
clearly intended to rape Mr. Lam.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.966
Please convict her.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:05.008
His wife intended to rape him.

00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:06.383
It's a false accusation, Your Honor!

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.675
Mr. Lam came on the pretext
of collecting rent,

00:06:08.758 --> 00:06:09.966
but he assaulted my wife.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.675
When I came back,
I saw him holding my wife's hands.

00:06:12.758 --> 00:06:15.258
He pressed my wife on the table
and wanted to rape her.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.216
I couldn't help but to hit him
with a wooden stick.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.341
Then his lackeys rushed in
and held me down.

00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.466
Lam Ji-weng, you held her hands.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.841
Obviously, you wanted to rape his wife.

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:33.175
Your Honor, you're so smart
and wise today.

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:34.716
Really?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.383
You look great too.

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:38.091
I always look great.

00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:39.591
Are your palms red?

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:40.758
Help me take a look.

00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:43.841
What are you doing?

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:44.800
Hey!

00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:47.091
You meant holding hands constitute raping.

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:48.716
So, am I raping you now?

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:52.925
Sit down and watch my show.

00:06:53.425 --> 00:06:55.300
The fact is Mr. Lam wanted
to take his house back

00:06:55.383 --> 00:06:56.633
because they didn't pay the rent.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:07:00.508
They refused and threatened
Mr. Lam with a rape accusation.

00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:01.883
Please make a fair judgment.

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:03.008
No, Your Honor.

00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:05.883
The house was rented
by Mr. Lam's dad to my dad.

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:07.675
My dad saved his dad's life.

00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:09.841
So, his dad rented out the house
at 30 taels a year.

00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:11.841
We paid the rent promptly every year.

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:14.008
Do you have the lease? Let's have a look.

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:15.091
Yes.

00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:16.758
It's as small as a godson.
How can I read it?

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:18.925
Or would you rather read
the godfather-sized deed?

00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:20.008
Which do you prefer?

00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:21.050
Godfather.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:22.758
Good boy.

00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:25.800
I thought you don't call others godfather.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:30.383
The lease is here. Read it out loud.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:34.341
"I, Lam Dai-fook, am renting
the house on Dai-su Street

00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:37.675
to my benefactor, the Wong family,
to repay his good deed.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.300
If they are unable to pay the rent,

00:07:39.383 --> 00:07:43.175
they cannot be evicted nor can the house
be rented to another party.

00:07:43.258 --> 00:07:45.716
My sons and grandsons are obliged
to honor this lease."

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.925
See? Your dad doesn't mind
if he doesn't pay the rent.

00:07:48.008 --> 00:07:49.883
He paid the rent yearly.
How can you evict him?

00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:51.966
Yes, we pay 30 taels every year.

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:55.341
What? It should be
30,000 taels, Your Honor!

00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:56.841
What? Just because you say so?

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.716
Your Honor, did you even study?

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:00.925
I know you never studied.

00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:02.383
Let me show you.

00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:06.675
The lease should be read this way.

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.675
"The house is rented to Wong
to repay his good deed.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.716
If the rent of 30,000 taels per year
isn't paid,

00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:20.425
give notice, evict, and rent to others."

00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:21.925
How could you amend it this way?

00:08:22.008 --> 00:08:23.508
Can you make your judgment now?

00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:29.133
Are you delaying because you want money?

00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:35.341
This banknote of 3,000 taels is not yours.

00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:38.841
This is for you.
You're only worth this much.

00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:39.841
Take it.

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.050
One tael?

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:43.091
-Take it or leave it.
-No, it's fine.

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.633
Hurry up. Give your conviction!

00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:00.466
Wong Lo-chou owes rent.
You should move out as soon as possible.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.466
Return the house to Lam Ji-weng.

00:09:02.883 --> 00:09:06.675
Regarding the accusation
of Mrs. Wong raping Mr. Lam--

00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:08.925
Since she didn't succeed, just forget it.

00:09:09.508 --> 00:09:11.633
Mr. Lam is generous indeed.

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:12.633
Thank you!

00:09:12.716 --> 00:09:13.841
You're heartless!

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:20.466
Godson, heed my advice.
Go home and become a farmer.

00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:22.466
You dare call yourself an official.

00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:24.841
You're truly a laughing stock.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.133
Hey, the Chi family's carriage
is here to pick up the bride.

00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:34.175
Who would marry that consumptive?

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.091
Even Pao Lung-sing can be a magistrate.

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:39.091
Anything can happen.
Come on, let's drink some tea.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.133
-Uncle, where are you going?
-I'm going out for a stroll.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:44.425
-No, please don't.
-Why?

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.300
PRESTIGE

00:09:46.383 --> 00:09:49.008
CORRUPTED OFFICIAL, STEP DOWN.
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED BY GODS.

00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:50.925
This is too much.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.050
Yu-fa, go out and take a look.

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.675
Mr. Pao is coming out!

00:09:57.758 --> 00:10:00.800
-Stone him to death!
-Stone him to death!

00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:02.341
Sir, it's dangerous out here.

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:04.008
In that case, we'll use the rear exit.

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:10.425
Uncle, it's safe. Come out.

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:11.758
It's fine.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.008
Let's go.

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:20.925
What's the matter?

00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:22.800
"We welcome you, bastard."

00:10:23.216 --> 00:10:24.341
I wonder if it's meant for you.

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.966
Impossible. My name isn't bastard.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.550
-Stone him!
-Stone him!

00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:32.216
Take a look, it's fresh.

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:33.966
Buy some vegetables!

00:10:34.758 --> 00:10:37.716
Sir, buy some. They are fresh.

00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:42.466
So far, so good.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.341
This disguise works.

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:45.466
Mr. Pao!

00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:49.966
Deep-fried Mr. Pao.
Deep-fried Pao Lung-sing.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.216
Dude, this is stinky bean curd.
How is it related to Pao Lung-sing?

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.050
That useless Pao Lung-sing
are smellier than these stinky bean curd.

00:10:58.133 --> 00:10:59.050
How can you say that?

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.800
Deep-fried Pao Lung-sing!

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:05.925
Today's story is how Pao Lung-sing
was raped by a few strong men.

00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:09.841
This corrupted magistrate
deserves to be raped.

00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:12.050
Am I really that disgusting?

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:13.841
Yau-wai, tell me the truth.

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:17.633
Yes. After looking at you for a while,
I do feel nauseous.

00:11:18.675 --> 00:11:21.425
Even if that was true,
you could've worded it nicely.

00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:28.550
Pao Lung-sing was towed to the mud
and was beaten up.

00:11:28.675 --> 00:11:33.550
The muscular men fed him with shit.
He kept on eating it happily.

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:35.591
He seemed to be enjoying it.

00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:37.133
He then said, "I can't stop eating."

00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:39.925
Did I do anything bad to you
for you to hate me that much?

00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:42.133
Nonetheless, I'm a magistrate.

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:44.675
Although I'm not very handsome,
you don't need to slander me like this.

00:11:44.758 --> 00:11:46.133
I don't believe everyone hates me.

00:11:46.216 --> 00:11:47.466
Raise your hand if you like me!

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.133
-Run!
-Go!

00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.633
Don't raise your hand
if you don't want to.

00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:55.966
But you all ran away. What does that mean?

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.050
-Where are they going?
-To take weapons.

00:12:00.675 --> 00:12:03.800
-Stone him!
-Stone him!

00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:08.216
I think they are against me.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.300
Isn't that obvious?

00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:11.216
What a failure.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.383
I make no money
and everyone ends up hating me.

00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:15.966
I must educate the future generation!

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.883
Because children will be
the masters of the future.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.050
As long as they like me, I'll have hope.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.216
Little boy.

00:12:21.383 --> 00:12:23.383
Good boy, I like you.

00:12:26.216 --> 00:12:29.300
Who could have imagined
a little boy has so much saliva?

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:38.758
No way.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.591
How can that consumptive get married?

00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:41.550
You're right.

00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:51.300
He's good.

00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:53.633
He's fighting in my territory
without informing me.

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:54.716
Who does he think he is?

00:12:58.383 --> 00:13:01.966
I'm Panther, the best constable.
Here to arrest the 40 notorious robbers.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.425
Whoever gets in my way will be killed!

00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:05.008
-Run!
-Run!

00:13:24.716 --> 00:13:26.091
What happened to the carriage?

00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:28.050
Son, go get your bride.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.508
What a waste!

00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:37.508
Will her husband die suddenly tonight?

00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.550
If he dies, then will you take his place?

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:41.966
You were the one who said it, not me.

00:13:49.383 --> 00:13:51.633
-Mr. Pao.
-No, I'm definitely not.

00:13:51.758 --> 00:13:54.508
Mind your tongue
or I'll report to the court.

00:13:54.591 --> 00:13:57.466
You don't have to deny it.
I recognize you from your smell.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.300
It's an honor to have
your presence grace my son's wedding.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:04.008
Uncle, you're appreciated.
You should give thanks to Buddha.

00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:05.716
Do you really appreciate me?

00:14:06.883 --> 00:14:10.008
Without corrupted officials,
how can profiteers like us live in peace?

00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:11.383
So, you're one of us.

00:14:12.508 --> 00:14:16.633
Sir, please be present
and join our celebration.

00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:17.758
Sure, let's go.

00:14:17.841 --> 00:14:20.466
-Remember to give us a red packet.
-Sure! This way, please.

00:14:21.883 --> 00:14:23.675
Smile for the happy occasion.

00:14:29.758 --> 00:14:31.591
It's almost done. Just a tad more.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.008
Old man, your son is coughing badly.

00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:43.300
Don't worry. He's fine.

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:47.258
Don't cough your lungs out, pal.

00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:48.966
He's okay. Don't worry.

00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:55.633
What did he cough out? What's this?

00:14:56.175 --> 00:14:57.175
A piece of liver!

00:14:57.841 --> 00:14:59.133
Pal, are we having a hot pot later?

00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:00.675
What a relief.

00:15:00.758 --> 00:15:02.258
It's done. Please take a rest.

00:15:02.341 --> 00:15:03.383
Okay.

00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:06.300
Hey.

00:15:07.383 --> 00:15:10.341
Uncle, they are getting married.
Stop dreaming.

00:15:10.425 --> 00:15:12.133
What? He may die during the wedding.

00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:13.841
He even coughed out his liver.

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:16.216
-Is that really the liver?
-What do you think?

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.466
Thank you.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.425
Yuen-kwan, congratulations on
your son's marriage.

00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:31.800
I'm only his stepmom.

00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:33.883
This is merely a formality.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.300
Yuen-kwan.

00:15:35.883 --> 00:15:38.758
I heard you've kept a handwritten copy
of Wah-yim Sutra.

00:15:39.383 --> 00:15:40.383
Can I have a look?

00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:42.758
You should go first.

00:16:00.466 --> 00:16:03.341
Where can a dead man like you run to?

00:16:03.425 --> 00:16:05.091
Panther, you rely on your powerful sword!

00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:06.883
-If you have guts, drop your sword.
-All right!

00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:11.050
-Attack!
-Attack!

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.633
Panther, your hands are powerful!

00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:19.925
If you have guts, don't use them.

00:16:20.466 --> 00:16:21.383
All right.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.425
Get him.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.966
Your legs are powerful!

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.675
Try not using your hands, legs, and sword.

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:31.383
All right!

00:16:46.966 --> 00:16:48.675
-His voice is really powerful.
-Yes.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:51.633
Someone's dead.
Hurry, report to the court!

00:16:51.716 --> 00:16:53.300
I am an official.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:55.008
What am I then?

00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:57.175
I'm the best constable.

00:16:57.258 --> 00:16:59.800
I'm the best martial arts expert
from Liu Shan Men.

00:16:59.883 --> 00:17:02.300
Lui Pao, also known as Panther.

00:17:02.966 --> 00:17:06.133
I've chased after these notorious robbers
for the past seven days and nights.

00:17:06.216 --> 00:17:08.633
In fact, you've kept them here.

00:17:08.716 --> 00:17:10.758
Sir, I don't know anything.

00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:12.550
Don't you know
they were coming to this wedding?

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:14.883
Sir, my son's getting married.

00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:18.133
-I didn't know they had sneaked in.
-Really?

00:17:18.216 --> 00:17:21.591
Sir, I dare not lie to you.

00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:23.800
Mr. Pao, don't you think so?

00:17:23.925 --> 00:17:25.425
Mr. Pao! Where are you?

00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:26.883
-Mr. Pao!
-Mr. Pao!

00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:29.341
Sir, he doesn't respect us.
It's shameless to hide under the table.

00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:31.258
Be quiet. We're here to catch a breath.

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.800
He seems to be powerful now.
I'll let him have the limelight first.

00:17:33.883 --> 00:17:36.425
Once he gets full of himself
and makes a mistake,

00:17:36.508 --> 00:17:39.383
we'll attack, skin him alive,
and break every bone in his body.

00:17:40.841 --> 00:17:41.758
What's the matter?

00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.008
I'm talking about roasted pig.
Why are you eavesdropping?

00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:50.133
-So you're the so-called magistrate here.
-Yes, I am.

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:55.383
You must be in cohorts with him
to protect these robbers

00:17:55.716 --> 00:17:57.008
and plotting a rebellion!

00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:59.175
He's as good as you at framing others.

00:17:59.258 --> 00:18:01.258
Since we are of the same kind,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.425
let's share the cake.

00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:05.425
I'll take a bigger share
and you'll take the rest.

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:09.425
I want it all.

00:18:09.508 --> 00:18:10.425
That's fine with me.

00:18:10.508 --> 00:18:12.008
What can I help you with?

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:14.966
Let me tell you now that my visit today

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.550
is actually an undercover operation
to check whether you've committed a crime.

00:18:18.716 --> 00:18:19.800
Thank goodness.

00:18:19.883 --> 00:18:23.216
Constable Panther and I have uncovered you

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.133
as the mastermind
behind the arson and murders.

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:26.175
Someone, arrest him.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.050
Your Honor, it's not my doing.

00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:30.050
I've been framed.

00:18:31.091 --> 00:18:33.425
It has nothing to do with me.

00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:36.841
-All right, deal!
-Thank you!

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.258
They said we'll get 50,000 taels
within two hours.

00:18:39.341 --> 00:18:41.841
Why don't we go back
and ask two ladies to dine with us?

00:18:43.508 --> 00:18:44.925
Two aren't enough.

00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:47.216
I want 20!

00:18:55.341 --> 00:18:56.966
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE

00:18:58.091 --> 00:18:59.133
Sir, please wait here.

00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:01.133
I'll check if the ladies have arrived.

00:19:01.758 --> 00:19:03.633
They are here. Coming through.

00:19:03.716 --> 00:19:04.841
Is everyone here already?

00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:08.133
Go and entertain Mr. Panther.
Do you understand?

00:19:09.466 --> 00:19:10.716
Sir.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.425
You bastard. How dare you offend me?

00:19:20.508 --> 00:19:21.800
Shithead.

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.008
That bastard, Mr. Pao
has fallen into the hole!

00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:47.633
Bastard! Stone him to death!

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:53.258
-You deserve it!
-Martial arts expert, right?

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.550
What's going on? Are you playing?

00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:09.758
How can you drop rats
in there to torture him?

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.050
Mr. Panther, don't worry.

00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:13.258
I'll put a snake in there
to eat all the rats.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.258
Wait for me, Uncle!

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.133
Hurry up, the banquet will be over soon.
I want to eat the sweet soup.

00:20:22.216 --> 00:20:24.091
It's almost dawn.
Be happy if there's an orange left.

00:20:24.175 --> 00:20:26.633
-Mr. Pao!
-Mr. Pao!

00:20:26.716 --> 00:20:29.258
-I am not.
-Mr. Pao, hold on.

00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:31.675
We know how great you are.

00:20:31.758 --> 00:20:34.591
You dealt with Panther
and saved the entire Chi family.

00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:37.216
We represent the Chi family
to welcome you.

00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:38.550
Let's cheer for Mr. Pao.

00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:40.591
You are great! Bravo!

00:20:41.425 --> 00:20:44.758
Mr. Pao, please give us a speech.

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:46.716
Say something decent.

00:20:49.758 --> 00:20:51.175
Have they served the noodles yet?

00:20:51.925 --> 00:20:54.341
Mr. Pao, we haven't even
eaten the roasted pig.

00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:57.508
We reserved one solely for you.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.550
Let's go.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.883
Enjoy the dinner.

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:07.966
Thank you, Your Honor. You're really wise.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.883
You're welcome. Think of it as a gift.

00:21:09.966 --> 00:21:11.966
Old man, haven't you eaten
the roasted pig yet?

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.175
Oh, it's you again!

00:21:15.258 --> 00:21:17.425
Are you going to spit?
Don't do it or I'll beat you up.

00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:18.550
This is for you.

00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:30.258
-You're great, Mr. Pao.
-Thank you.

00:21:32.925 --> 00:21:35.425
Treat your wife well or I'll lock you up.

00:21:35.508 --> 00:21:38.175
-I will.
-Eat more liver. It's nutritious.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.966
Now, go to your wedding chamber.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.841
Go now. Go.

00:22:06.591 --> 00:22:07.966
I don't want to marry you.

00:22:08.758 --> 00:22:10.008
I want to marry Mr. Pao.

00:22:11.008 --> 00:22:11.925
Mr. Pao!

00:22:12.008 --> 00:22:12.966
Siu-lin!

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:13.925
That's great, Siu-lin.

00:22:14.008 --> 00:22:15.508
-Come here, Siu-lin!
-Hey.

00:22:15.675 --> 00:22:16.800
What are you doing, Uncle?

00:22:18.883 --> 00:22:20.133
They are staring.

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:22.383
Let's leave!

00:22:25.258 --> 00:22:28.008
Watch out for fire.

00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:08.591
<i>Pretend to have a stomach ache</i>

00:23:08.758 --> 00:23:11.133
<i>-Line up for the toilet
</i>-Help! Save me!

00:23:11.216 --> 00:23:14.508
<i>-Pretend to have a stomach ache
</i>-Help! Save me!

00:23:15.925 --> 00:23:17.216
-What's going on?
-Go!

00:23:25.508 --> 00:23:26.383
Don't move!

00:23:27.008 --> 00:23:27.925
Let me handle this.

00:23:30.216 --> 00:23:31.175
You guys should do it.

00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:35.300
Uncle, if you can't,
you should let me do it.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.175
Damn you. How dare you hit me?

00:23:42.258 --> 00:23:44.925
The entire Chi family is dead!

00:23:55.633 --> 00:23:56.633
Don't touch anything!

00:24:08.508 --> 00:24:10.550
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE

00:24:19.383 --> 00:24:21.716
How dare you!
You dare attack another person in court!

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.508
Bite with all your strength!

00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:24.550
I'm not afraid!

00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:27.258
Uncle, stop toying with him.

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:28.341
Mind the foot.

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:29.341
It's none of my business.

00:24:30.425 --> 00:24:32.341
Let go of me!

00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:35.050
How dare you. Do you know--

00:24:35.133 --> 00:24:37.216
-I know nothing.
-Do you understand--

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:38.883
I know nothing.

00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.883
-Bastard! Prepare him for punishment.
-Beat him!

00:24:41.675 --> 00:24:42.800
Do you want to beat me?

00:24:43.008 --> 00:24:44.883
A low-ranking magistrate
like you wants to beat me.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.300
Don't you know I'm the son
of the Navy commander, Shang Kwan?

00:24:49.508 --> 00:24:50.925
Is the Navy commander a senior position?

00:24:51.008 --> 00:24:52.133
Twenty ranks higher than yours.

00:24:54.383 --> 00:24:57.091
Mr. Shang, have you eaten yet?
Mr. Shang, would you like some tea?

00:24:57.175 --> 00:24:58.216
How about the finest tea?

00:25:06.133 --> 00:25:08.008
No. I'm a decent and honest magistrate.

00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:11.216
Shit, even if the emperor commits a crime,
he should be perished!

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.425
-It's "punished."
-Whatever!

00:25:12.508 --> 00:25:13.883
Even if he were the prince!

00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:16.800
Mrs. Chi. Did he kill your family?

00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:17.966
Yes, Your Honor!

00:25:19.091 --> 00:25:23.466
My family, altogether 13 people,
were killed by him.

00:25:24.716 --> 00:25:26.341
Please render justice.

00:25:26.883 --> 00:25:28.883
Please tell the court
what actually transpired.

00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:29.925
Your Honor.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.383
Shang Wai is my mother-in-law's cousin.

00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:36.591
He always visits the family.

00:25:38.508 --> 00:25:42.425
That night, my husband was very ill.

00:25:44.008 --> 00:25:46.216
I went to the altar to ask for blessings.

00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:48.966
Suddenly,

00:25:49.758 --> 00:25:52.966
someone covered my nose
with a handkerchief.

00:25:55.008 --> 00:25:56.841
I could only smell a potent medicine.

00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:01.300
After that, I passed out.

00:26:07.383 --> 00:26:08.716
When I woke up,

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.800
I was already...

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.008
I was defiled by Shang Wai.

00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.425
You beast!

00:26:20.508 --> 00:26:22.258
Guards, beat him 12,738 times.

00:26:22.341 --> 00:26:23.591
Never mind! Let me do it!

00:26:23.675 --> 00:26:26.633
Uncle, don't be rash. Let her finish.

00:26:26.716 --> 00:26:27.591
All right, go on.

00:26:28.841 --> 00:26:29.800
That night...

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.133
You beast, you're inhuman!

00:26:36.216 --> 00:26:37.091
Enough!

00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:39.091
You were unconscious just now.

00:26:39.758 --> 00:26:41.633
Why don't we do it again
as compensation to you?

00:26:42.091 --> 00:26:43.008
Don't come over.

00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:44.091
You asshole!

00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:47.383
How dare you have an affair with her!

00:26:47.466 --> 00:26:48.716
Shut up!

00:26:49.383 --> 00:26:50.508
Let go of me!

00:26:50.716 --> 00:26:53.300
Shut up!

00:26:53.716 --> 00:27:00.258
Shut up!

00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:06.383
Yuen-kwan!

00:27:06.466 --> 00:27:08.091
You bastard, you killed my wife.

00:27:08.175 --> 00:27:10.383
I won't let you go.
I'll report to the court!

00:27:10.508 --> 00:27:11.758
Father!

00:27:18.758 --> 00:27:24.425
-I want to kill you!
-Don't be rash. Let her finish.

00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:28.008
Time reporter,
describe the scene in detail!

00:27:28.091 --> 00:27:29.341
I was doing my patrol.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.758
Suddenly, I heard Chi family's dog
barking wildly.

00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:34.216
So, I went in to have a look.

00:27:34.466 --> 00:27:36.175
I saw corpses everywhere.

00:27:37.008 --> 00:27:39.175
I saw Shang Wai and Loi-fook fighting.

00:27:39.883 --> 00:27:42.550
Someone kicked me
and I lost consciousness.

00:27:42.633 --> 00:27:44.050
After that, I saw nothing.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.091
Summon Loi-fook!

00:27:47.841 --> 00:27:50.091
Did Shang Wai kill all 13 members
of the Chi family?

00:27:50.383 --> 00:27:51.383
Yes.

00:27:52.966 --> 00:27:54.758
He wanted to kill me too.

00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.508
Don't be afraid. I'm here to protect you.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.258
Help me, Your Honor. Please help me.

00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.550
You said you would protect me.

00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:04.758
He has already given me leeway.

00:28:04.841 --> 00:28:06.716
If I weren't around,
he would've gone for your throat.

00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:11.425
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.091
-What happens now?
-Lock him up temporarily.

00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:15.550
Kill him after examining the bodies.

00:28:15.633 --> 00:28:16.633
Lock him up first!

00:28:16.716 --> 00:28:19.008
-Kill him after the examination of bodies!
-Yes.

00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:21.716
Do you want to convict me? I'm not scared!

00:28:23.175 --> 00:28:25.800
-I'm not scared!
-What did you say? You talk too much!

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.883
You hit the wrong person! Where's justice?

00:28:31.258 --> 00:28:32.341
Mrs. Chi.

00:28:34.258 --> 00:28:38.758
Don't worry. I will try my best
to avenge your family.

00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:41.383
Uncle, you've done a great job.

00:28:41.591 --> 00:28:43.008
What's shining so bright?

00:28:48.591 --> 00:28:51.008
It's the light from the sycee, Your Honor.

00:28:52.008 --> 00:28:52.883
It's you.

00:28:53.008 --> 00:28:55.341
We work for our own masters in court.

00:28:55.508 --> 00:28:58.508
I'd like to compensate you now.
What do you say?

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:00.091
What compensation?

00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:04.466
Like an old Chinese saying,
"There is a golden house in the books."

00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:06.383
If you do me a small favor,

00:29:06.508 --> 00:29:09.050
you don't need to study
to get this golden house.

00:29:09.966 --> 00:29:11.675
-Let's discuss it.
-Hey!

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:13.341
What do you mean?

00:29:13.466 --> 00:29:16.216
Mr. Shang Wai is the son
of Navy commander.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.591
You do know it, don't you?

00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:21.925
But do you know
that the Navy commander, Mr. Shang,

00:29:22.008 --> 00:29:24.091
is the blood brother of Eunuch Lee?

00:29:24.508 --> 00:29:25.550
Who's that?

00:29:25.633 --> 00:29:28.216
Are you referring to Lee Lin-ying?

00:29:28.508 --> 00:29:32.175
He's the right hand
of the empress dowager.

00:29:32.258 --> 00:29:33.133
You scared me.

00:29:33.258 --> 00:29:38.425
On behalf of Mr. Shang,
these sycees are sent to you as a present.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.675
What do you want?

00:29:42.508 --> 00:29:45.258
The commander's mom is now 97 years old.

00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:47.383
She loves Mr. Shang very much.

00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:49.925
She heard the news about Mr. Shang.

00:29:50.091 --> 00:29:51.883
She's been crying again and again.

00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:57.133
Mr. Shang hopes that you can
let Mrs. Shang visit her grandson.

00:29:57.633 --> 00:29:59.258
Sir, you better rest early.

00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:01.425
Tomorrow, I will bring
Mrs. Shang out of prison.

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:03.675
Why don't you just help
with this simple task?

00:30:03.841 --> 00:30:05.675
Are you bribing me?

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.550
Isn't that the reason
you became an official?

00:30:08.633 --> 00:30:10.716
I've become an honest and decent official.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.300
I won't be bribed. Let me tell you that.

00:30:13.383 --> 00:30:15.341
-Haven't you heard of it?
-Yes!

00:30:15.466 --> 00:30:17.841
But be considerate. She is so old.

00:30:18.258 --> 00:30:20.841
Yes, she's old. I have to respect her.

00:30:22.008 --> 00:30:25.091
Filial duty is the first thing
we Chinese should do.

00:30:30.508 --> 00:30:31.925
I'm a little bit tired.

00:30:32.133 --> 00:30:34.091
-Yau-wai, lead them to prison.
-Yes!

00:30:34.175 --> 00:30:35.091
Wait!

00:30:35.675 --> 00:30:37.091
When I wake up and open my eyes,

00:30:37.175 --> 00:30:39.133
I want Shang Wai kneeling
in the court, okay?

00:30:39.216 --> 00:30:41.466
Of course. Thank you, Your Honor.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.216
This way, please.

00:30:45.258 --> 00:30:47.008
She's almost 100 years old.

00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:50.133
She just wants to see her grandson.
It's fine.

00:30:54.841 --> 00:30:59.591
Let me go!

00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:01.341
Don't you know
my dad is the Navy commander!

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:03.216
My godfather is Eunuch Lee.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.550
I want to kill your family!

00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:06.883
Don't chat for too long.

00:31:06.966 --> 00:31:09.258
It's going to be difficult for me.

00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.050
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Thank you!

00:31:13.675 --> 00:31:14.633
Who are you?

00:31:14.841 --> 00:31:16.050
Your grandma is here to visit you.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.508
Grandma?

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.716
Dad.

00:31:32.175 --> 00:31:33.216
Did you have a death wish?

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.716
You caused big trouble.

00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:37.341
Dad, take me away.

00:31:37.466 --> 00:31:38.716
Where can you go?

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.133
I'm the Navy commander.

00:31:40.216 --> 00:31:42.925
Even if you escape, the government
will still request me to arrest you.

00:31:43.133 --> 00:31:44.883
I disguised myself to visit you.

00:31:44.966 --> 00:31:47.175
Do you know it's already a big risk?

00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:49.508
If I was discovered, I'd be in trouble.

00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:52.091
-What should I do? I'm scared.
-Don't worry.

00:31:52.966 --> 00:31:57.425
I employed this famous lawyer,
Mr. Fong, to defend you.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:03.341
Mr. Shang, you have to tell me
every detail.

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:04.716
Don't miss anything.

00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.966
How's the case? Can you help?

00:32:13.425 --> 00:32:14.841
Luckily, it's only midnight.

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.675
We still have four hours to work.

00:32:17.008 --> 00:32:18.175
What are we doing?

00:32:18.258 --> 00:32:19.508
Changing white to black.

00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.341
Changing the plaintiff
to be the defendant.

00:32:21.425 --> 00:32:24.966
Tomorrow, you have to remember.

00:33:02.466 --> 00:33:05.258
-Court.
-Court.

00:33:05.341 --> 00:33:07.008
Yau-wai.

00:33:07.675 --> 00:33:09.258
-Yau-wai.
-Yes?

00:33:09.508 --> 00:33:10.425
What's the matter, Uncle?

00:33:10.508 --> 00:33:12.050
I haven't gotten up.
Why are they starting?

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:13.591
Mr. Chan came back early in the morning.

00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:14.591
Mr. Chan?

00:33:14.675 --> 00:33:15.925
Yes, he's the magistrate.

00:33:16.008 --> 00:33:17.175
You're the acting magistrate.

00:33:17.258 --> 00:33:18.758
He recovered so he'll be the judge.

00:33:18.841 --> 00:33:20.133
You were sleeping soundly

00:33:20.216 --> 00:33:21.466
-so I didn't wake you up.
-Shit!

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.425
Uncle!

00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:29.300
Your Honor.

00:33:31.216 --> 00:33:34.300
-Sir, this case--
-Cut the crap, step aside.

00:33:35.216 --> 00:33:37.508
-Step aside!
-Yes.

00:33:39.591 --> 00:33:41.675
Uncle, sit here.

00:33:41.925 --> 00:33:42.800
Damn it.

00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:47.341
Mrs. Chi, you accused Shang Wai
of killing your family.

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:48.841
Other than you, who has witnessed it?

00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:51.133
Summon the coroner!

00:33:52.175 --> 00:33:54.800
Your Honor, regarding the 13 bodies
of Chi family and a dog,

00:33:54.883 --> 00:33:56.466
all their faces turned black.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.800
I tested with a silver needle.
It turned black too.

00:33:58.883 --> 00:34:01.841
I'm sure they were poisoned to death.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.300
I discovered a pot of sweet soup.

00:34:06.383 --> 00:34:07.925
It was mixed with arsenic.

00:34:08.258 --> 00:34:09.341
How dare you!

00:34:09.425 --> 00:34:11.508
Your family was poisoned to death.

00:34:11.675 --> 00:34:13.633
Why did you claim Shang Wai killed them?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.300
You're framing him, aren't you?

00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:17.591
Your Honor, that's not true!

00:34:17.675 --> 00:34:20.425
Your Honor, I saw Shang Wai
chasing after her servant.

00:34:20.508 --> 00:34:22.050
Who saw Shang Wai chasing Loi-fook?

00:34:22.133 --> 00:34:23.925
I saw it. The time reporter saw it too.

00:34:24.383 --> 00:34:26.508
Time reporter? Summon the time reporter.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.591
Your Honor, I didn't see
Shang Wai chase after Loi-fook.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.633
When I entered the Chi family's garden,

00:34:32.716 --> 00:34:36.508
I saw Loi-fook chasing after Shang Wai,
and he was defending himself.

00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:38.966
Loi-fook kicked me, and then I fainted.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.466
I don't know what happened after that.

00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:42.966
This is not what you said last night.

00:34:43.216 --> 00:34:44.841
-You--
-I felt dizzy last night,

00:34:44.925 --> 00:34:46.341
so I talked nonsense.

00:34:46.425 --> 00:34:49.050
-Think before you talk. This is--
-Shut up!

00:34:49.675 --> 00:34:51.300
Summon the drugstore keeper, Chu Yee.

00:34:52.008 --> 00:34:53.050
Right, Your Honor.

00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:56.300
Yesterday afternoon,
this woman came to my store to buy drugs.

00:34:56.633 --> 00:34:59.716
She said there were rats in her house
so I sold her a catty of arsenic.

00:35:02.425 --> 00:35:03.633
I didn't, Your Honor.

00:35:03.716 --> 00:35:05.341
I didn't buy arsenic from this store.

00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:08.133
I always go there to buy cough medicine
for my husband.

00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:10.091
Who is it?

00:35:14.716 --> 00:35:18.508
Your Honor, I'm Fong Tong-kan.
I want to sue someone.

00:35:19.841 --> 00:35:20.841
He...

00:35:22.716 --> 00:35:23.758
Who are you going to sue?

00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:27.550
I represent the Shang family to sue
Mrs. Chi, who failed to seduce Mr. Shang,

00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:29.216
so she framed him for murder.

00:35:30.758 --> 00:35:35.050
Secondly, I want to sue Pao Lung-sing
for bribing and framing Mr. Shang.

00:35:36.383 --> 00:35:40.300
Sir, I heard that Mr. Pao has been bribed
by Mrs. Chi with 30,000 taels.

00:35:40.383 --> 00:35:42.091
Now, his house is filled with money.

00:35:44.258 --> 00:35:45.841
Is that true?

00:35:47.716 --> 00:35:50.425
-Someone, go check it.
-Yes!

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:52.716
Your Honor, it's a setup.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.508
-No, I have to tidy up our place first.
-Freeze.

00:35:56.591 --> 00:35:58.508
Your Honor, there is a lot of money
in Mr. Pao's place.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.258
Pao Lung-sing,
you're temporarily suspended.

00:36:03.508 --> 00:36:05.758
I'll decide after the truth is revealed.

00:36:09.508 --> 00:36:12.091
Mrs. Chi didn't give me the money. He did!

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.591
How dare you frame him now?

00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:16.591
If you speak up again, I will beat you.

00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:20.175
-I--
-Uncle, save it. They colluded.

00:36:20.258 --> 00:36:21.925
Come on. Just stay with me.

00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.966
Godson, I can't help you now.

00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:29.675
Thirdly, I want to sue Mrs. Chi
for killing her whole family.

00:36:30.508 --> 00:36:32.258
Sir, I'm being framed!

00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:35.133
Shang Wai killed my family!

00:36:35.216 --> 00:36:37.550
How dare you scream in court!

00:36:37.633 --> 00:36:39.550
-Someone, slap her.
-Yes!

00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:41.050
I'm being framed!

00:36:44.425 --> 00:36:47.216
Sir, how can the plaintiff
become defendant and vice versa?

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.258
You're fired.

00:36:48.341 --> 00:36:50.133
If you don't shut up, I'll beat you hard.

00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:52.091
Someone, summon Shang Wai!

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:56.133
Your Honor!

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.383
Sir, I'm Ms. Yiu's cousin.

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:01.633
Last night, I accidentally discovered
the affair of Mrs. Chi and Loi-fook.

00:37:01.716 --> 00:37:04.050
Mrs. Chi begged me
not to disclose the secret.

00:37:04.341 --> 00:37:06.216
She asked me to discuss
with her in her place.

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:09.258
When I went to her place,
she made sweet soup.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.425
But her family were all gone.

00:37:11.841 --> 00:37:13.758
She offered the sweet soup to me.

00:37:14.383 --> 00:37:16.216
You're lying!

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.466
-Slap her again.
-Yes, Your Honor.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.175
Your Honor!

00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:23.883
I was suspicious so I didn't drink it.
I looked around.

00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:26.383
I discovered her family members
were all dead.

00:37:26.758 --> 00:37:28.425
Loi-fook rushed in to kill me.

00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:29.758
He released his dog to bite me.

00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:32.425
I rushed to the streets in fear
and Loi-fook chased after me.

00:37:32.508 --> 00:37:35.091
Suddenly, he shouted for help!

00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:36.883
I didn't know what kind of code was that.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.466
After that, Mr. Pao and his men
arrived and arrested me.

00:37:42.383 --> 00:37:44.925
-You are lying!
-Hey!

00:37:45.008 --> 00:37:49.425
You're framing me!

00:37:50.508 --> 00:37:51.633
Summon the gynecologist.

00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:54.550
Your Honor.

00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:58.966
As per your request,
I've examined Mrs. Chi.

00:37:59.383 --> 00:38:01.050
On the day of the tragedy,

00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:02.716
there were signs of sexual intercourse

00:38:03.216 --> 00:38:05.633
and she is pregnant for two months.

00:38:11.466 --> 00:38:13.466
Your Honor, it adds up.

00:38:13.675 --> 00:38:15.591
Her husband is weak and ill.

00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:17.800
The doctor said he couldn't have children.

00:38:18.216 --> 00:38:19.925
The public knows it.

00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:22.800
She's pregnant now.

00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:24.883
That proves her affair with Loi-fook.

00:38:24.966 --> 00:38:26.008
Summon Loi-fook!

00:38:27.175 --> 00:38:28.591
Your Honor.

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:30.883
How dare you seduce your master?

00:38:30.966 --> 00:38:33.591
You even killed the Chi family.
Do you admit to your crime?

00:38:34.091 --> 00:38:37.758
Your Honor, I had an affair with Mrs. Chi.

00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:42.591
But I didn't poison the family.
She did it alone.

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:44.383
I didn't.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.841
Don't lie. How can she fall for you?

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:48.591
Who will believe you?
Show me the evidence.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.883
Mrs. Chi loves me.

00:38:51.966 --> 00:38:54.633
She thinks I'm talented,
so she wrote me a poem.

00:38:54.716 --> 00:38:56.966
I brought it here. Let me read it out.

00:38:57.925 --> 00:39:02.258
"Ever since we met,
I know we are two of a kind.

00:39:02.383 --> 00:39:07.091
Who cares how long we can be together?
We should just enjoy our time."

00:39:07.175 --> 00:39:09.091
Your Honor, please read this.

00:39:09.508 --> 00:39:10.716
I'm being framed.

00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:17.258
How dare you hook up with your servant,

00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:19.591
poison and kill
all 13 members of your family?

00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:23.091
Now, all the evidence
is enough to prove you are guilty.

00:39:23.175 --> 00:39:24.925
Are you going to admit it?

00:39:25.966 --> 00:39:27.758
I'm being framed, Your Honor.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.091
Punish her.

00:39:32.091 --> 00:39:34.258
Your Honor, stop it.
She can't take it anymore.

00:39:34.341 --> 00:39:36.175
Uncle, give up.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.883
As a third-generation official,
I know framing is common in court.

00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:41.508
But, you are going too far now.

00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:43.425
You have no say here.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.675
No.

00:39:45.675 --> 00:39:46.716
Go ahead.

00:40:33.633 --> 00:40:35.883
Mrs. Chi has confessed to all her crimes.

00:40:36.091 --> 00:40:38.466
Well, her death sentence
will happen after autumn.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.758
-Yes!
-Lock her up for now.

00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:41.341
Adjourn.

00:40:52.591 --> 00:40:53.508
I'm sorry!

00:41:14.175 --> 00:41:16.675
You bastard, you colluded
with them to set me up!

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.550
I won't let you go!

00:41:22.425 --> 00:41:25.216
I won't let you go!

00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:33.633
Snow! It's snowing.

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.716
Snow in June.

00:41:35.883 --> 00:41:38.591
It's a setup.

00:41:38.675 --> 00:41:40.133
Let's try the case again!

00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:41.925
-It's a setup!
-Uncle.

00:41:48.883 --> 00:41:51.050
The house is empty.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:52.633
Where can we get the evidence?

00:41:52.716 --> 00:41:54.550
Do you expect the evidence
to be on the table?

00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:56.050
You should find it yourself.

00:42:02.716 --> 00:42:05.716
Uncle, what a tough dog.

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:11.425
Isn't it Chi family's dog? Bill.

00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:12.591
How do you know that?

00:42:15.216 --> 00:42:16.633
Who wrote it?

00:42:17.633 --> 00:42:18.633
I remembered.

00:42:18.883 --> 00:42:21.675
You asked them not to move the evidence
and you wanted them to label it.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.925
God is helping me.

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:24.925
Show me its head.

00:42:25.841 --> 00:42:26.716
Turn it!

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.550
No poison?

00:42:33.758 --> 00:42:35.175
Obviously, its neck was broken.

00:42:35.466 --> 00:42:36.925
It was killed.

00:42:37.425 --> 00:42:39.050
Why were the family members poisoned then?

00:42:39.341 --> 00:42:40.675
I have to examine the corpses.

00:42:41.341 --> 00:42:43.050
Messing with the corpses is a felony.

00:42:43.133 --> 00:42:45.216
COFFIN HOME

00:42:54.425 --> 00:42:55.841
The head is connected by these nails.

00:42:55.925 --> 00:42:58.133
If the nails are pulled out,
the body will be separated.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.133
He was beaten to death.

00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:05.258
But the needle turned black.

00:43:05.341 --> 00:43:07.091
It proved that there's poison
in his throat.

00:43:07.175 --> 00:43:09.425
Hurry up, it stinks.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.341
I have to examine another corpse.

00:43:15.716 --> 00:43:17.925
Try stabbing into the stomach.

00:43:18.008 --> 00:43:20.258
If they are poisoned,
the needle will turn black too.

00:43:27.925 --> 00:43:29.966
It didn't turn black.
There's no poison inside his stomach!

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:32.883
But there's poison in the throat.

00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:35.216
I think they were beaten to death.

00:43:35.508 --> 00:43:37.300
Then, the poison was poured
into their throat.

00:43:37.591 --> 00:43:39.383
So, the poison could never
reach the stomach.

00:43:39.633 --> 00:43:40.883
That's right!

00:43:40.966 --> 00:43:42.133
I got it!

00:43:42.216 --> 00:43:43.550
Bravo!

00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:44.675
Yes!

00:43:45.008 --> 00:43:47.216
-We got it!
-Yes!

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.341
-Bravo!
-We found it!

00:43:49.966 --> 00:43:53.258
-Yes!
-Bravo!

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:55.383
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

00:43:57.466 --> 00:43:58.841
Your Honor. Why are you here?

00:43:58.925 --> 00:44:01.466
I came here to arrest you.

00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:05.633
Do you want to destroy the evidence?

00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:07.008
You will be put in jail.

00:44:09.175 --> 00:44:10.133
Mr. Chan.

00:44:15.508 --> 00:44:16.591
Mr. Shang.

00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:17.925
Well done.

00:44:18.425 --> 00:44:20.300
You're very wise.

00:44:20.383 --> 00:44:23.758
You know they will come back
for the evidence to reverse the verdict.

00:44:23.925 --> 00:44:27.133
Set fire to this place
and destroy everything.

00:44:27.216 --> 00:44:28.258
I understand.

00:44:28.383 --> 00:44:31.300
When you're weeding,
you must dig up the root.

00:44:31.383 --> 00:44:34.008
Find someone in prison and...

00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:39.966
Pal, please tell my superior.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.216
If I become a state witness,
will he give me some leeway?

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.175
You're dumb.

00:44:43.258 --> 00:44:44.925
Your nephew was faster.
He's the state witness.

00:44:45.008 --> 00:44:47.550
He's going against you.
He's drinking soup at home now.

00:44:49.216 --> 00:44:51.008
-You deserve it.
-What did you say?

00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:52.216
Corrupted officials like you

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.133
deserve to be put in jail
and be chopped into pieces.

00:44:56.008 --> 00:44:58.758
I'm not in a good mood.
Cut the crap. I won't entertain you.

00:44:58.841 --> 00:45:00.633
So what? Come and fight me if you dare.

00:45:00.716 --> 00:45:02.675
Don't push it. I will beat you.

00:45:02.758 --> 00:45:04.091
You bastard.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.633
You deserve to be with that bitch!

00:45:06.716 --> 00:45:08.508
What bitch? What did you say?
Say it again!

00:45:08.591 --> 00:45:10.300
The one that married the consumptive!

00:45:10.383 --> 00:45:12.008
She's behind the wall.

00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:13.175
Do you mean this wall?

00:45:13.258 --> 00:45:14.758
The wall behind you!

00:45:15.383 --> 00:45:16.800
You should have told me earlier.

00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:23.091
Mrs. Chi! I'm Pao Lung-sing.

00:45:23.175 --> 00:45:24.341
Where are you?

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:28.383
Save your crocodile tears.

00:45:29.883 --> 00:45:31.883
Just charge me with anything you want.

00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:36.216
In fact, I want to reunite
with my husband in heaven.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:39.175
What a pity.

00:45:39.883 --> 00:45:41.716
I'm having his baby.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.508
Is the baby really that consumptive's?

00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:45.008
I mean your husband's.

00:45:46.675 --> 00:45:49.675
My husband got a hereditary nostrum.

00:45:50.925 --> 00:45:55.050
He took medicine regularly.
He had almost recovered.

00:45:56.425 --> 00:45:59.633
He also got back his reproductive ability.

00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:01.050
That's so great.

00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:04.508
Why don't you come over here?

00:46:05.716 --> 00:46:07.716
You can torture me as you please.

00:46:08.675 --> 00:46:09.966
You've misunderstood.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.716
Look at me.

00:46:18.258 --> 00:46:19.633
To reverse your conviction,

00:46:21.008 --> 00:46:22.425
I was dragged down too.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.925
Mr. Pao, I've wronged you. I'm sorry.

00:46:27.133 --> 00:46:28.341
It doesn't matter.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.716
If I can make it out one day,
let me copy your hereditary nostrum.

00:46:33.008 --> 00:46:36.466
However, I think
they will kill me this time.

00:46:37.425 --> 00:46:39.758
Mr. Pao, I'm sorry.

00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:41.050
Please don't say that.

00:46:43.508 --> 00:46:46.050
Mrs. Chi, please give me your finger.

00:46:57.341 --> 00:46:59.341
I don't think this world has no justice.

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:00.800
I promise you.

00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:04.675
As long as I'm alive,
I will try my best to save you.

00:47:05.716 --> 00:47:06.800
Thank you, sir.

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:08.633
Uncle!

00:47:09.258 --> 00:47:10.133
Uncle!

00:47:10.216 --> 00:47:11.383
-You bastard.
-Cut the crap.

00:47:11.466 --> 00:47:13.050
-You're sentenced to death!
-Death sentence?

00:47:13.133 --> 00:47:15.341
They said you allied
with notorious robbers,

00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:18.383
smuggled arms, pushed an old lady
into the sea, and raped a pig.

00:47:18.675 --> 00:47:20.175
I've never raped a pig.

00:47:20.258 --> 00:47:22.925
They want to frame you.
You'll be dead meat.

00:47:23.008 --> 00:47:24.133
I've discussed it with grandpa.

00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:26.258
Before your death,
we want you to leave a descendant.

00:47:26.341 --> 00:47:28.508
So, we've got you a virgin.

00:47:28.591 --> 00:47:30.800
-I want that too!
-Next time!

00:47:30.883 --> 00:47:32.216
Cut the crap. Go in and reproduce.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.466
Yu-fa, hurry up.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.508
It's really you, Yu-fa.

00:47:39.591 --> 00:47:41.050
Of course, it's me.

00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:42.966
Don't waste time. Let's do it.

00:47:43.591 --> 00:47:46.425
Yau-wai, take a black cloth
and cover me please.

00:47:46.508 --> 00:47:49.300
That's unnecessary.
I have a new technique, Breaking the Wall!

00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:54.133
Yu-fa, you're incredible!

00:47:54.216 --> 00:47:55.675
Hurry, let's go now.

00:47:56.883 --> 00:47:59.341
Mrs. Chi, don't worry.
I will come back and save you.

00:47:59.425 --> 00:48:00.425
Let's go!

00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:04.175
Sir, I wish you a safe journey.

00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:06.966
Live long and happily.

00:48:13.425 --> 00:48:16.341
Sing, I'm glad you're back.

00:48:16.966 --> 00:48:19.050
Great, you got your memory back.

00:48:19.258 --> 00:48:20.300
Mom.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.425
Sing, it's great to see you.

00:48:23.508 --> 00:48:26.175
Your dad is seriously ill.

00:48:27.383 --> 00:48:29.841
How are you, Dad? Are you okay?

00:48:30.091 --> 00:48:32.966
I'm glad you're rescued.

00:48:33.425 --> 00:48:35.508
I'm useless. I brought shame to you.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.925
That's not true.
You're not as vicious as them.

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:42.133
A corrupted official should be vicious.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.633
A decent official should be more vicious.

00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:48.508
If not, how can you cope
with those vicious bastards?

00:48:48.716 --> 00:48:52.966
Sing, make an imperial appeal
at the capital.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.425
I want to do so.

00:48:54.508 --> 00:48:56.508
I have one half of this biscuit.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.425
I kept this for 20 years.
You better make good use of it.

00:49:00.091 --> 00:49:01.341
What does this represent?

00:49:02.508 --> 00:49:08.133
The current judicial secretary
was my best friend back then.

00:49:08.425 --> 00:49:10.216
He almost starved to death.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.716
I had a biscuit so I gave it to him.

00:49:12.966 --> 00:49:15.300
After that, he returned half of it to me.

00:49:15.425 --> 00:49:17.841
He said when he succeeds in life,

00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:21.008
if my descendants
take this biscuit to him,

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:23.008
he'll try his best to repay me.

00:49:23.133 --> 00:49:25.258
But I'm afraid
I would be no match for them.

00:49:25.341 --> 00:49:28.508
How come? We are from the Pao family.

00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:32.091
In the Song Dynasty,
our ancestor, Pao Ching...

00:49:32.175 --> 00:49:34.591
-Justice Bao?
-Yes, that's him!

00:49:34.675 --> 00:49:38.550
He wrote a sacred manuscript.

00:49:38.633 --> 00:49:42.341
That manuscript is with me.
I've learned everything.

00:49:42.508 --> 00:49:45.175
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Where is it now?

00:49:45.258 --> 00:49:48.425
Your mom put it under the table
for her mahjong sessions.

00:49:48.508 --> 00:49:50.675
CHING-WAN MANUAL

00:49:54.383 --> 00:49:55.841
But I can't read these letters.

00:49:56.175 --> 00:49:57.841
Those are small seal characters.

00:49:57.925 --> 00:50:00.591
You didn't study hard.
That's why you don't know.

00:50:00.716 --> 00:50:02.425
Ask someone to teach you.

00:50:02.508 --> 00:50:03.341
I know it, Dad.

00:50:03.425 --> 00:50:05.966
What kind of treasures do you have?
Give them all to me.

00:50:06.508 --> 00:50:09.133
We have a sword of state.

00:50:09.258 --> 00:50:12.966
It was given by the previous emperor.
Take it to the capital.

00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:15.133
Where is it now?

00:50:16.633 --> 00:50:17.675
Take it.

00:50:18.133 --> 00:50:22.883
This is authorized to kill
the corrupted kings and vicious officials.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.508
Take it.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.591
Yau-wai, keep the treasured sword.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.175
Dad!

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.758
Dad!

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.800
I just want to...

00:50:43.091 --> 00:50:44.466
What's wrong with you?

00:50:45.508 --> 00:50:47.925
Do you want to set me free
to kill Pao Lung-sing?

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.591
You are nasty too.

00:50:56.758 --> 00:51:01.425
Without you telling me,
I will still tear him to pieces!

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.091
Yau-wai, Mom gave you some gold.

00:51:06.175 --> 00:51:08.466
Why are you carrying so many carrots?

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.175
These are the gold grandma mentioned.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:15.050
I think these carrots are enough
for us to go to the capital.

00:51:16.133 --> 00:51:18.300
Uncle, there's something over there.

00:51:24.216 --> 00:51:26.175
That idiot looks like you.

00:51:27.175 --> 00:51:28.841
-No, he doesn't.
-No, he doesn't.

00:51:33.008 --> 00:51:34.008
Thank goodness.

00:51:35.966 --> 00:51:37.508
Uncle, is this the face you made?

00:51:42.591 --> 00:51:43.925
We're in a dangerous situation.

00:51:44.383 --> 00:51:45.300
We survived.

00:51:45.466 --> 00:51:47.050
-That's him!
-That's him!

00:51:47.133 --> 00:51:49.425
Don't run!

00:51:49.508 --> 00:51:50.425
Run!

00:51:57.925 --> 00:51:59.675
Don't run!

00:52:21.508 --> 00:52:22.925
Hurry up, it's getting dark.

00:52:24.133 --> 00:52:26.008
Hurry up, let's get on board.

00:52:26.258 --> 00:52:27.216
Untie the boat.

00:52:28.091 --> 00:52:29.675
Don't run, you bastard!

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.425
Don't chase after me!

00:52:34.925 --> 00:52:36.008
Wait for me!

00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:38.383
<i>A lady.</i>

00:52:40.216 --> 00:52:41.341
Why did you risk your life?

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:43.675
Someone wants to kill me,
so I had no choice.

00:52:43.758 --> 00:52:44.966
Don't run, bastard!

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:46.466
You can never escape!

00:52:46.925 --> 00:52:48.300
Bastard!

00:52:48.466 --> 00:52:50.550
Don't run, bastard!

00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:51.633
Who is he calling?

00:52:51.716 --> 00:52:53.008
He's calling me Betty.

00:52:53.383 --> 00:52:54.966
Betty?

00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:56.591
Thank you for your help.

00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:59.341
-May I know your name?
-Stone Mansion.

00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:01.383
-What about yours?
-Stone Talk.

00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:02.508
How secretive.

00:53:02.883 --> 00:53:05.008
-Stone Mansion.
-Stone Talk.

00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:06.258
Forget it then.

00:53:06.341 --> 00:53:08.508
Why did the guy chase after you?

00:53:09.216 --> 00:53:13.925
Clearly, he's attracted by her beauty,
so he attempted to rape her.

00:53:14.008 --> 00:53:16.841
Idiot, he's a man.

00:53:17.341 --> 00:53:19.675
Don't worry. I'll treat you to a meal,
so you can calm down.

00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:23.716
Come on, don't be shy.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.758
Ms. Stone.

00:53:24.841 --> 00:53:26.550
Are you going to the capital?

00:53:26.633 --> 00:53:28.383
Yes, we are.

00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:30.175
But we won't enter the capital.

00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:32.550
-Come on, help yourself.
-Sure.

00:53:32.633 --> 00:53:35.300
Why don't we go there together
so we can take care of each other?

00:53:35.383 --> 00:53:36.258
Ask him.

00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:38.425
But you have to help us with the show.

00:53:38.508 --> 00:53:39.591
I know nothing.

00:53:40.133 --> 00:53:41.675
-You can learn.
-What?

00:53:41.841 --> 00:53:43.258
Eat up, don't be shy.

00:53:43.758 --> 00:53:45.841
Take this. Come on.

00:54:48.966 --> 00:54:50.341
Bravo!

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.716
YUT-LOI INN

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.300
A <i>dudou</i>?

00:55:38.425 --> 00:55:40.341
Ying, you packed your stuff.
Where are you going?

00:55:40.883 --> 00:55:43.550
I don't want to bother you
since I know you're unhappy.

00:55:43.925 --> 00:55:45.300
I better leave.

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.550
Where can you go?

00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:52.050
I will go with the flow.

00:55:52.133 --> 00:55:53.466
You better get shelter here.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.966
-If you stay, I'll take care of you.
-Thank you.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:57.966
I'll help myself then.

00:56:10.091 --> 00:56:11.383
You are nasty.

00:56:11.966 --> 00:56:13.008
I...

00:56:13.383 --> 00:56:14.800
Damn it, just a small trick!

00:56:14.883 --> 00:56:16.883
Now, I have free accommodation and meals.

00:56:16.966 --> 00:56:18.008
What a coincidence.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.383
How did you come in?

00:56:21.466 --> 00:56:22.883
There is a hole.

00:56:22.966 --> 00:56:24.258
That's a rat hole.

00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:25.841
I know how to shrink my body.

00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:27.758
-How wonderful!
-Cut the crap.

00:56:27.841 --> 00:56:31.133
The inn is full. I'm afraid
we have to sleep in the same bed.

00:56:31.216 --> 00:56:32.758
-We can't do that.
-Don't be afraid.

00:56:32.841 --> 00:56:34.925
-We're men. Unless you're...
-I'm not.

00:56:35.008 --> 00:56:35.925
So, come on.

00:56:36.466 --> 00:56:38.008
Ying, come out now.

00:56:38.175 --> 00:56:39.258
I'm coming.

00:56:40.925 --> 00:56:41.925
What's the matter?

00:56:42.008 --> 00:56:44.091
-Your relative wants to see you.
-My relative?

00:56:50.966 --> 00:56:52.341
I found you at last.

00:56:52.425 --> 00:56:54.675
Shut up, I don't want to see you.
Get lost now.

00:56:54.758 --> 00:56:56.508
-I don't...
-Shut up.

00:56:56.591 --> 00:56:59.258
-I don't...
-Shut up!

00:56:59.591 --> 00:57:02.175
Why don't you let me greet you?

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.300
Ms. Betty!

00:57:09.758 --> 00:57:11.050
You're so smart.

00:57:11.383 --> 00:57:13.425
If I were smart,
I wouldn't have been beaten.

00:57:13.508 --> 00:57:15.341
You almost revealed my secret.

00:57:15.841 --> 00:57:17.050
What? What about Ms. Betty?

00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:21.133
They are so kind to let you stay.

00:57:21.216 --> 00:57:23.216
Why did you lie to them?

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.425
Sorry, she's a girl.

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.883
-Dad!
-We call her Betty at home.

00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.883
Are you a woman?

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.800
You know it.

00:57:32.883 --> 00:57:35.425
It's not convenient
for a girl to travel around.

00:57:35.508 --> 00:57:37.633
So, she dressed like this.

00:57:37.966 --> 00:57:40.550
Betty, say sorry to them. Go.

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:43.550
So, you're the brother
and also the sister.

00:57:43.633 --> 00:57:44.800
You're so smart.

00:57:44.883 --> 00:57:46.383
Please don't tease me.

00:57:47.383 --> 00:57:49.716
Ms. Betty, could you please come over?

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.050
Stop bothering me.

00:57:51.883 --> 00:57:54.633
I want to tell you something
about Uncle Pao.

00:57:56.008 --> 00:57:57.133
I will be right back.

00:57:59.216 --> 00:58:00.383
I've checked.

00:58:00.466 --> 00:58:02.758
This group is going to the capital.

00:58:02.841 --> 00:58:04.925
We just have two carrots left.
How can we survive?

00:58:05.008 --> 00:58:07.258
-Let's follow them to the capital.
-You needn't teach me.

00:58:07.341 --> 00:58:08.966
You can't do that to her!

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.841
She is a girl.

00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:12.050
I didn't know that.

00:58:12.133 --> 00:58:14.716
So, do you know it now?

00:58:16.175 --> 00:58:17.383
Ying!

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.966
Sleep with me tonight.

00:58:21.133 --> 00:58:22.091
Great!

00:58:23.175 --> 00:58:26.633
Hang on, I can't sleep alone.
I'm afraid of the darkness.

00:58:26.716 --> 00:58:29.341
No problem, I'll sleep with you.

00:58:36.216 --> 00:58:37.508
What a beautiful moon.

00:58:37.591 --> 00:58:39.800
It won't be beautiful soon.
Come and sleep.

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.883
Have you chatted with others
on the rooftop while looking at the moon?

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:46.466
I hate that the most!

00:58:46.716 --> 00:58:48.591
I forgot who told me.

00:58:49.008 --> 00:58:51.091
When the moon is
the roundest and prettiest,

00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.341
tell it your wish and it will come true.

00:58:55.425 --> 00:58:57.050
Have you ever made a wish to the moon?

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.216
How about you?

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.633
I made a wish back then
to be a decent official.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.758
When I grew up, I know
it's hard to be a decent official.

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:06.300
But I'm neither decent nor nasty.

00:59:06.383 --> 00:59:07.800
I achieved nothing.

00:59:08.341 --> 00:59:11.966
I heard the muscular man
called you bastard.

00:59:13.675 --> 00:59:14.800
Who are you actually?

00:59:15.425 --> 00:59:17.341
-My surname is Pao.
-Are you Pao Lung-sing?

00:59:17.466 --> 00:59:18.508
Do you know me?

00:59:18.716 --> 00:59:20.300
Everyone in the nearby provinces
knows you.

00:59:20.383 --> 00:59:22.758
You were fired while fighting
for justice for a woman.

00:59:22.841 --> 00:59:24.383
Your courage is praised.

00:59:24.633 --> 00:59:27.383
In fact, I'm not. I dare not look down.

00:59:27.466 --> 00:59:29.216
In my heart, you're the bravest.

00:59:29.758 --> 00:59:31.300
Since you insist, I must admit.

00:59:31.383 --> 00:59:33.758
I'm a low-profile person.
Please don't report to the court.

00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:35.300
I can sleep outside.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:38.633
If you don't sleep with me,
your identity will be easily exposed.

00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:51.091
Be careful during your journey.

00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:53.341
You must always think about me.

00:59:54.008 --> 00:59:56.258
You have to wear more clothes
when you are doing shows.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.383
Remember to miss me, okay?

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.925
-Don't court other girls!
-Don't seduce other men!

01:00:06.716 --> 01:00:07.883
Don't worry, I won't.

01:00:10.883 --> 01:00:11.800
Hey!

01:00:12.716 --> 01:00:13.758
When will we meet again?

01:00:13.925 --> 01:00:17.133
Next year, we will meet
in spring when the flowers blossom.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.216
Take care.

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.675
SECRETARY'S MANOR

01:00:23.591 --> 01:00:25.675
-Is this really your biscuit?
-Yes!

01:00:26.591 --> 01:00:29.300
I'm glad to see you. How's your dad?

01:00:29.633 --> 01:00:30.925
He has just passed away.

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.758
Why do kind people die early?

01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:36.841
I'll cut to the chase.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.633
I came a long way to meet you.

01:00:38.716 --> 01:00:40.925
I want to make an imperial appeal.

01:00:41.675 --> 01:00:42.591
What is it about?

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:43.966
I was an official.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.758
But a rich guy colluded
with a corrupted official--

01:00:46.841 --> 01:00:48.550
That's enough. I can't accept it.

01:00:48.633 --> 01:00:52.050
I hate this kind of people the most!

01:00:52.508 --> 01:00:56.216
Uncle, I finally see hope.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.175
Tell me. Who's that guy?

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:02.466
We will fight for you by all means.

01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:04.466
He's called Shang Wai.

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:07.633
His dad is that bastard, Shang Kwan,
the Navy commander.

01:01:09.925 --> 01:01:12.050
Your Excellency. What do you think?

01:01:12.966 --> 01:01:14.591
What's your idea?

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:17.091
I wish I could chop their heads off...

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:19.758
and use them to wipe my ass.

01:01:20.383 --> 01:01:21.550
Uncle, I want to wipe mine too.

01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:23.133
After you finish, I'll wipe mine again.

01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:26.133
Are you interested? I can lend it to you.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:27.341
Do I have a share?

01:01:27.466 --> 01:01:29.175
Sir, may I know your name?

01:01:29.466 --> 01:01:31.425
I am Shang Kwan!

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.716
It's a trap!

01:01:40.425 --> 01:01:41.591
I won't give a damn!

01:01:42.341 --> 01:01:44.258
Your Excellency, it's so decent of you.

01:01:44.425 --> 01:01:46.550
-This guy--
-Save your breath.

01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:49.550
-What?
-Save your breath! Go now!

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.716
Officials protect each other.

01:01:52.925 --> 01:01:54.216
My dad helped you once.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.425
Even if you don't help me,
you should give me some benefits.

01:01:56.508 --> 01:01:59.258
You can pay me a few million taels
for me to eat porridge when I go back.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.258
Your dad gave me
a tasteless biscuit back then.

01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:02.883
At most, I could repay you a biscuit.

01:02:02.966 --> 01:02:05.341
But I'm kind enough
to repay you 100 of it!

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.466
You really have guts. Yau-wai, let's go.

01:02:15.508 --> 01:02:18.508
Hold on, you needn't hurry.

01:02:18.591 --> 01:02:20.175
Why not eat the biscuits first?

01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:22.508
Someone, feed them with biscuits.

01:02:22.633 --> 01:02:26.675
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!

01:02:28.925 --> 01:02:33.258
-Swallow it!
-Swallow it!

01:02:33.341 --> 01:02:34.800
Do you want to accuse me?

01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:38.925
Even His Majesty can do nothing to me.

01:02:39.008 --> 01:02:40.758
Why don't we kill them?

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:43.841
No, I want them to stay
in the capital to be beggars!

01:02:43.966 --> 01:02:48.091
So that his dad will lose his reputation.

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:00.258
Yau-wai. How are you?

01:03:01.758 --> 01:03:02.716
-I...
-Are you okay?

01:03:04.758 --> 01:03:07.175
I feel a little bit hungry.

01:03:07.925 --> 01:03:10.425
-Thank you for your help.
-You're welcome.

01:03:10.508 --> 01:03:12.508
Dear my daughter-in-law,
come and thank His Excellency.

01:03:13.633 --> 01:03:14.966
-Thank you.
-No worries.

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.633
When is the baby due?

01:03:16.716 --> 01:03:18.425
It's next month.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:20.925
-You have to join the full-moon party.
-Sure.

01:03:25.633 --> 01:03:28.425
-Go away!
-Go away!

01:03:28.508 --> 01:03:29.716
ERLANG SHEN TEMPLE

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:32.966
Come on, buy some incense.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.883
You will be blessed.

01:03:34.966 --> 01:03:37.633
Miss, come and buy some incense.

01:03:37.716 --> 01:03:39.675
Do you want to sell incense?

01:03:47.966 --> 01:03:51.341
Uncle, we've been driven to a dead end.

01:03:51.425 --> 01:03:52.883
We will have a way out.

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:56.216
I know but we haven't eaten for days.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.466
Thank you!

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.633
Pal, I'm an official!

01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:01.925
Free buns!

01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:04.508
-Let's go.
-Hey!

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:09.425
Miss, please give me one. One more.
I haven't eaten for days.

01:04:09.508 --> 01:04:12.300
Yau-wai, don't take those buns.
If you take it, you'll become a beggar.

01:04:12.383 --> 01:04:14.216
Leave me. I'd rather be a beggar.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.466
-Listen to me, please.
-Don't block my way.

01:04:18.466 --> 01:04:20.508
Someone is giving money!

01:04:22.383 --> 01:04:23.341
Yau-wai!

01:04:25.091 --> 01:04:27.550
I can't get used to begging.
I won't be a beggar!

01:04:28.633 --> 01:04:31.675
How dare you eat for free
at our place? Go to hell!

01:04:32.883 --> 01:04:34.466
Go to hell!

01:04:40.425 --> 01:04:41.800
Pal, did you cheat for a free meal?

01:04:41.883 --> 01:04:44.550
So what? I'm going to another restaurant.

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:48.675
Okay, I'd rather be a cheater.

01:04:58.591 --> 01:05:00.258
Come again when you have time.

01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:02.925
Sir.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:05.175
I can tell that you're a visitor.

01:05:05.258 --> 01:05:07.591
I can tell that you're rich.

01:05:07.675 --> 01:05:09.800
Fung, Chun. Come and serve our VIP.

01:05:09.883 --> 01:05:11.300
Come, have some tea.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.425
Do you not like it?
Come to our VIP room then.

01:05:13.508 --> 01:05:16.216
I will serve you the best dishes.
Let's go, don't be shy.

01:05:16.383 --> 01:05:19.383
Sir, don't rush.
You might choke if you eat so fast.

01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:22.716
Eat the vegetables or maybe the fish.

01:05:23.008 --> 01:05:24.508
Are you full?

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:25.633
Well, have some wine.

01:05:25.716 --> 01:05:28.050
-Come on, this is my toast.
-Stop bothering me.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:32.050
Come on, drink it.

01:05:39.383 --> 01:05:41.508
No one cares about eating in a brothel!

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.008
-Crazy!
-No, he isn't.

01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:46.050
He has good taste.

01:05:46.133 --> 01:05:47.425
Ordinary girls don't entice him.

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:49.508
I have to serve him with our treasure.

01:05:49.591 --> 01:05:51.841
Yu Yin!

01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:58.966
Let's go out.

01:06:05.216 --> 01:06:06.216
You...

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.508
Who I am is not important.

01:06:07.883 --> 01:06:11.341
We're fated to meet each other here.

01:06:12.175 --> 01:06:13.175
I--

01:06:13.633 --> 01:06:14.800
Don't say anything.

01:06:15.133 --> 01:06:18.508
Let's close our eyes
and guess each other's character,

01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:20.425
identity, and interests.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.841
One, two, three.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.383
You are a woman.

01:06:29.508 --> 01:06:32.133
You are a decent woman.
You don't care about money.

01:06:32.216 --> 01:06:33.300
Anything else?

01:06:33.383 --> 01:06:34.925
Guess who I am.

01:06:36.841 --> 01:06:39.091
I don't know your past.

01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:41.300
But soon, you'll become handicapped.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.050
You don't even have a penny.

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.633
How dare you come to our place?

01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:51.175
Don't come over.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:52.925
Or I will stab her eyes.

01:06:53.841 --> 01:06:54.925
Visit a brothel?

01:06:55.008 --> 01:06:56.550
You have no money but ate a great meal.

01:06:56.633 --> 01:06:57.550
Finding prostitutes?

01:06:57.633 --> 01:06:59.550
I will cut your balls off!
You can't use them!

01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:00.591
How dare you?

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.133
Did you see that?
This is the right way to beat him.

01:07:08.841 --> 01:07:10.300
Really? No money at all.

01:07:10.383 --> 01:07:12.383
Just some cheap clothes. Damn it.

01:07:13.925 --> 01:07:14.966
Just one old book!

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.508
Don't touch my book.

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:23.675
Don't burn my book.

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:26.591
You can't burn it. Don't!

01:07:28.675 --> 01:07:29.591
It's over.

01:07:29.675 --> 01:07:33.133
From this day onward,
you have to be a pimp for three months!

01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:45.508
Clean them properly.

01:07:50.383 --> 01:07:52.008
Pour away the water.

01:07:56.133 --> 01:07:59.050
He's so pitiful.
He can't even close his mouth.

01:07:59.133 --> 01:08:00.841
How can he eat?

01:08:07.758 --> 01:08:09.383
Tell your owner to come out.

01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:12.133
Or I will scold her entire family as well.

01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:17.091
Flaming Aunt. What's the matter?

01:08:17.175 --> 01:08:19.425
Your girls have taken all my customers!
What do you think?

01:08:19.508 --> 01:08:21.800
The clients pay whoever they like.

01:08:21.883 --> 01:08:23.508
It's not our fault.

01:08:23.591 --> 01:08:26.633
No way, I want you to cover my loss!
Serve me tea and apologize!

01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:28.425
Otherwise, I will teach you a good lesson!

01:08:28.591 --> 01:08:31.675
Do you want to quarrel with me?

01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:42.716
Buttless son. Butt-selling dad.
Pathetic butt. Chicken butt lover.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.550
Big butt. How can you blame me?

01:08:44.633 --> 01:08:45.800
-I'll scold you.
-Let me tell you.

01:08:45.883 --> 01:08:48.175
My dads died when I was three,
four, five, six, seven and eight.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:50.008
I seduced men at ten.
I slept with your man too.

01:08:53.425 --> 01:08:55.716
-How dare you!
-Show me your man. I will court him.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.883
I'll squeeze you to death!

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.508
If you squeeze me, I will enjoy it!

01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:00.133
I--

01:09:00.216 --> 01:09:01.258
Damn you!

01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:02.591
What is this word?

01:09:04.133 --> 01:09:05.758
Is it smart?

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.508
-It's smart.
-What a shame. You don't even know.

01:09:07.591 --> 01:09:09.800
You seduced men at seven.
You're 40 now. Don't you feel ashamed?

01:09:09.883 --> 01:09:11.800
You can't win an argument.
Don't you feel ashamed?

01:09:11.883 --> 01:09:13.258
What have you achieved in your life?

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:16.216
I've trained four famous prostitutes.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.883
They are the best in the capital.

01:09:18.175 --> 01:09:20.675
Right, but they are now under me.

01:09:21.508 --> 01:09:23.091
Haven't they told you?

01:09:23.175 --> 01:09:25.633
You're old and poor.
Even your girls left you. You should die.

01:09:27.216 --> 01:09:28.550
You'll still be dumb when you're dead.

01:09:28.633 --> 01:09:30.383
You'll become a pineapple core
in your next life!

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.841
-What does that mean?
-Thrown once used!

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:36.383
Do you want to quarrel with me? Get lost!

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.008
How wonderful.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.258
-I love you.
-Good. Go to hell!

01:11:09.175 --> 01:11:10.883
-What are you doing?
-Don't ask me.

01:11:11.758 --> 01:11:13.050
Don't you feel it?

01:11:13.966 --> 01:11:14.883
Close your eyes first.

01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:17.300
Do you still want to fool me?
I was terribly beaten last time.

01:11:17.675 --> 01:11:19.175
I won't beat you up.

01:11:19.716 --> 01:11:21.591
I just want to chat with someone.

01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:23.216
Why?

01:11:23.591 --> 01:11:25.883
I feel lonely and cold.

01:11:26.258 --> 01:11:27.675
Is it that serious?

01:11:28.383 --> 01:11:30.008
I always face those bastards.

01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:31.925
I can't make friends with them.

01:11:32.175 --> 01:11:34.508
-I'm a bastard too.
-No, you're not that bad.

01:11:35.175 --> 01:11:36.091
That's right.

01:11:36.175 --> 01:11:37.133
Hold me.

01:11:37.508 --> 01:11:38.550
Do you need that?

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:40.216
I won't fool you.

01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:44.091
I just want a man who's not
so disgusting to give me warmth.

01:11:44.758 --> 01:11:46.341
No way.

01:11:46.425 --> 01:11:48.008
Think of it as an act of kindness.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.550
All right.

01:11:49.675 --> 01:11:51.508
Be frank, you have to
give me a red packet.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.716
Bastard! How dare you court my girl?

01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:57.425
-Do you want to quarrel?
-I don't. You live, eat, shit here.

01:11:57.508 --> 01:11:58.925
How dare you court my girl? Heartless!

01:11:59.008 --> 01:12:01.091
She got bored of prostitution.
She wants me to comfort her.

01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:04.425
You're an old prostitute.
Have you ever felt lonely and cold?

01:12:04.716 --> 01:12:05.675
Yes.

01:12:05.925 --> 01:12:07.883
-None of your business!
-None of my business?

01:12:07.966 --> 01:12:10.175
I want you to be happy.
If not, you'll mistreat the clients.

01:12:10.258 --> 01:12:12.800
The clients won't come. If we close shop,
I have to sleep on the road.

01:12:12.883 --> 01:12:14.008
Is it none of my business?

01:12:14.091 --> 01:12:16.091
How dare you talk back? You will die!

01:12:16.175 --> 01:12:17.383
Before that, I'll pick your bones!

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:19.800
-Your son will have no ass!
-Do you mean your son?

01:12:19.883 --> 01:12:23.258
-How long can you continue this?
-Until you die!

01:12:23.925 --> 01:12:24.758
I...

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.383
You're prettier without makeup.
You'll live happily if you die.

01:12:26.466 --> 01:12:27.508
-You...
-I will drive you mad.

01:12:27.591 --> 01:12:28.925
Become a ghost and scare you to death.

01:12:32.841 --> 01:12:36.508
<i>How come this guy
is so good at quarreling?</i>

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:39.675
-Are you okay?
-Get lost!

01:12:39.925 --> 01:12:42.966
Handsome, don't go if you have guts.
I will look for help and quarrel with you.

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:44.175
I'll wait.

01:12:44.258 --> 01:12:46.300
EXTREMELY NOBLE, MAGICAL, AND WONDERFUL

01:13:11.841 --> 01:13:13.258
-You!
-Damn...

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:31.591
KING OF QUARREL

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.050
I heard you had a terrible quarrel
with Aunt San.

01:13:35.133 --> 01:13:37.425
-She even twisted her tongue.
-It was nothing.

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:41.633
You're the sharp tongue
of the brothel now.

01:13:41.966 --> 01:13:44.216
Someone's here to challenge us again.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.758
-How dare they!
-Let me handle it!

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:47.800
I'm working on a case now.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.508
If Yu Yin doesn't serve me tonight,

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:52.466
I'll turn this place over
to find the criminal.

01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:56.966
Please don't. She doesn't sell her body.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.008
It's not selling if I don't pay.

01:14:02.966 --> 01:14:04.425
-What are you doing?
-Panther is here!

01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:05.550
Hurry up and hide!

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.133
It's a pond out there.

01:14:12.675 --> 01:14:13.800
Sir.

01:14:20.925 --> 01:14:23.841
Sir, don't do this. I'll scream for help.

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:26.258
Go ahead! Nobody will hear you.

01:14:26.883 --> 01:14:28.925
Help me!

01:14:29.008 --> 01:14:30.300
Inhuman!

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.758
Could you stop now, sir?

01:14:32.841 --> 01:14:35.633
The royal duke is here.
He wants Yu Yin too.

01:14:36.258 --> 01:14:37.508
-Really?
-Yes.

01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:39.591
He brought a pale and young man with him.

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:41.466
Someone's here.

01:14:49.966 --> 01:14:51.175
Royal duke.

01:14:51.258 --> 01:14:53.716
So, this is Ms. Yu.

01:14:54.716 --> 01:14:56.508
No.

01:14:57.883 --> 01:15:01.258
-No?
-She is so pretty but you said no.

01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:03.925
No wonder, she's the number one here.

01:15:05.008 --> 01:15:07.050
My dear brother.

01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:09.341
Enjoy your chat with Ms. Yu.

01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:12.925
-Come with me.
-Yes, take your time.

01:15:16.508 --> 01:15:18.425
Don't do this. I'm going to scream.

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:21.508
Go ahead! It's useless!

01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:23.508
-Inhuman!
-Inhuman!

01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:25.508
There's a guest with Yu Yin.

01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:27.716
I'm the Home Affairs secretary.
Who dare stands in my way?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.341
-Please, sir. Sir!
-Get lost!

01:15:31.758 --> 01:15:32.966
Home Affairs secretary?

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.633
If he sees me,
he'll tell the dowager empress.

01:15:34.716 --> 01:15:35.591
I'll be in trouble.

01:15:35.883 --> 01:15:38.466
It's a pond out there.

01:15:39.758 --> 01:15:40.841
Under the bed.

01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:44.258
Please don't go in.

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:48.925
How dare you lie to me?

01:15:49.008 --> 01:15:51.383
There's no one here.

01:15:52.508 --> 01:15:54.425
There are enough people to play mahjong.

01:15:54.758 --> 01:15:56.800
Can you handle it, Yin?

01:15:57.341 --> 01:15:58.716
Don't worry.

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.258
Nice to meet you.

01:16:01.966 --> 01:16:03.716
-What's your name?
-Ai Shin Chue Luo.

01:16:09.091 --> 01:16:11.675
Don't do this. I'm going to scream.

01:16:11.758 --> 01:16:13.966
Go ahead. It's useless.

01:16:15.966 --> 01:16:19.091
Don't do this.
How come all men are like this?

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.300
I'm getting bored.

01:16:21.383 --> 01:16:22.591
-Inhuman!
-Inhuman!

01:16:23.258 --> 01:16:24.508
Have you ever played animal chess?

01:16:25.966 --> 01:16:27.800
Elephant eats tiger. Tiger eats cat.

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.008
Cat eats rat. Rat eats elephant!

01:16:30.633 --> 01:16:31.716
Rat, do you know what to do?

01:16:33.925 --> 01:16:34.841
Who is it?

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:37.383
Sir, a great hero like you
must be great in bed too.

01:16:37.466 --> 01:16:40.508
I'm here to learn your skills.

01:16:40.591 --> 01:16:42.050
Bastard! Get out!

01:16:42.133 --> 01:16:44.841
Sure, but I have a big mouth.
I don't know how to keep secrets.

01:16:44.966 --> 01:16:47.258
So, hundreds of people
may come to admire you like I did

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:49.091
and cheer you on.

01:16:49.175 --> 01:16:50.550
Here's the money! Get out.

01:16:50.883 --> 01:16:52.883
-I'll pay you. Do it quickly.
-I...

01:16:52.966 --> 01:16:54.883
It's either you do it or me.
You should leave.

01:16:54.966 --> 01:16:55.883
All right, leave.

01:16:55.966 --> 01:16:57.758
-Help me!
-What's the matter?

01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.341
So, you already had an audience here.

01:17:00.425 --> 01:17:01.800
I was prepared as well. Come out.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.633
Who are they?

01:17:04.716 --> 01:17:06.258
They are professional storytellers.

01:17:06.341 --> 01:17:07.925
They will spread a new story about you.

01:17:08.008 --> 01:17:10.216
It's divided into nine parts.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:11.633
I'm sure the audience will love it.

01:17:11.716 --> 01:17:12.758
Forget about me.

01:17:12.841 --> 01:17:13.841
Only one piece?

01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:16.591
There are four of us.
How do we divide this?

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:19.591
All right, three more. Let's go.

01:17:19.675 --> 01:17:20.716
Thank you.

01:17:22.341 --> 01:17:24.716
Sing, you were great!

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.633
Take it!

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:27.216
You are pretty smart.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.508
-Your Majesty.
-How do you know that?

01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:32.925
Forgive me. I found your royal underwear.

01:17:33.008 --> 01:17:34.341
Please forgive me.

01:17:34.966 --> 01:17:36.675
Maybe it dropped because I was too scared.

01:17:37.508 --> 01:17:38.925
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

01:17:39.841 --> 01:17:40.966
My visit to the brothel is...

01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:43.925
No, my visitation must be kept a secret.

01:17:44.008 --> 01:17:45.758
Whoever exposes it,
I'll kill his family members.

01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:48.341
Your Majesty, I have to ask for a favor.

01:17:48.425 --> 01:17:52.466
If you don't help me, I'll expose this
even if you kill my family members.

01:17:52.591 --> 01:17:54.258
How dare you threaten me?

01:17:56.966 --> 01:18:01.050
Why are you interested
in observing the plants today?

01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:04.591
I observed the weather
to be quite abnormal lately.

01:18:04.675 --> 01:18:06.175
There must be some injustice.

01:18:06.258 --> 01:18:08.133
I'd like to hear your opinions.

01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:13.758
Your Majesty. Everyone's having
a happy and stable life.

01:18:13.841 --> 01:18:14.925
Really?

01:18:15.008 --> 01:18:17.008
Then why would someone file
an imperial appeal?

01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:24.300
Your Majesty, it must be a rascal
trying to set them up.

01:18:24.383 --> 01:18:27.133
-Right. A setup. It must be a setup.
-A setup.

01:18:27.508 --> 01:18:29.425
But Pao Lung-sing seems decent.

01:18:29.883 --> 01:18:31.425
I don't think he's a rascal.

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:34.675
Pao Lung-sing looks like a rat.

01:18:34.758 --> 01:18:37.633
His father was well known
for his corruption. Like father, like son.

01:18:37.716 --> 01:18:40.758
-He is completely a rascal.
-That's right.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:44.466
-Is he that bad?
-Yes!

01:18:45.008 --> 01:18:46.675
Did he come here to make an appeal before?

01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:50.466
Summon Pao Lung-sing!

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.591
-Your Majesty.
-Rise.

01:18:56.425 --> 01:18:57.883
Did he come here to make an appeal?

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.633
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:19:00.716 --> 01:19:05.425
He took bribes and tried to frame my son.

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:09.466
But his boss was smart enough to fire him.

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:11.383
He's still a wanted criminal.

01:19:11.466 --> 01:19:13.758
So, His Excellency ignored him.

01:19:13.883 --> 01:19:16.216
How did Your Majesty get to know him?

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.758
Your Majesty,
I have informants everywhere.

01:19:19.841 --> 01:19:23.175
I heard that after he failed
in his imperial appeal,

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:25.466
he even worked as a pimp in a brothel.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.841
I'm sure Your Majesty
won't trust a pimp's words.

01:19:29.925 --> 01:19:32.425
-Unless you went to--
-Nonsense!

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:34.800
How could His Majesty visit there?

01:19:34.883 --> 01:19:36.383
Of course.

01:19:36.675 --> 01:19:38.341
I've never been a pimp.

01:19:38.425 --> 01:19:39.966
I hid myself to study hard.

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:42.841
I want to draft the lawsuit
and make an appeal again.

01:19:43.758 --> 01:19:45.133
Were you never a pimp?

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.925
All right. Someone, summon Aunt San.

01:19:54.716 --> 01:19:57.591
Luckily, I had a lead.
He would be dead meat.

01:19:58.716 --> 01:20:02.425
Your Majesty, this woman
is the owner of that brothel.

01:20:02.508 --> 01:20:04.675
She'll identify Pao Lung-sing.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.508
Yes, sir.

01:20:14.091 --> 01:20:15.675
Is he the pimp of your brothel?

01:20:15.758 --> 01:20:17.133
No! I've never met him.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.008
What's wrong?
Have you never seen a pretty lady?

01:20:22.008 --> 01:20:23.383
Okay. Step aside.

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:25.550
If he's not a pimp,
I can trust his words now.

01:20:25.841 --> 01:20:28.300
Pao Lung-sing, tell us about your case.

01:20:28.508 --> 01:20:31.258
Your Majesty, I used to be
an acting magistrate.

01:20:31.341 --> 01:20:33.466
But I was bullied by my boss,
Chan Pak-cheung.

01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:36.008
He framed a poor woman.

01:20:36.091 --> 01:20:38.091
She was pregnant
and yet she was sentenced to death.

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:39.550
I want a fair trial.

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.508
Your Majesty, he's lying.

01:20:42.591 --> 01:20:44.091
He's also a wanted criminal.

01:20:44.175 --> 01:20:45.716
What was his crime?

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.925
He messed with the corpses.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.383
No, I tried to investigate
the real cause of the victims' death

01:20:49.466 --> 01:20:51.216
because their deaths were suspicious.

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.925
Both of you sound right. What should I do?

01:20:56.383 --> 01:20:57.675
Let's make a bet.

01:21:00.341 --> 01:21:01.800
Here's an apple.

01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:05.758
If you can hit it by throwing this dagger,
I'll allow a retrial.

01:21:05.841 --> 01:21:08.508
-Your Majesty, please think about it.
-Your Majesty, please think about it.

01:21:10.466 --> 01:21:12.633
If you miss, you'll be killed!

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.508
-Your Majesty, just do it.
-Your Majesty, just do it.

01:21:15.925 --> 01:21:17.883
It's difficult for you
if we put it on the table.

01:21:18.716 --> 01:21:20.383
Let's put it on my head.

01:21:21.008 --> 01:21:23.425
-No, Your Majesty.
-Be mindful of your safety.

01:21:24.425 --> 01:21:26.050
You're truly loyal to me.

01:21:26.133 --> 01:21:27.633
No wonder you're the backbone.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.550
I'll let you replace my position
to hold the apple.

01:21:30.883 --> 01:21:31.841
Go ahead.

01:21:32.633 --> 01:21:34.258
Are you ready? Okay!

01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:40.133
Your Majesty,
I'd like to be blindfolded first.

01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:42.550
Do you usually throw with blindfolds on?

01:21:43.008 --> 01:21:45.258
No, but the blood will make me sick.

01:21:45.341 --> 01:21:46.341
All right.

01:21:49.133 --> 01:21:50.175
I'm throwing it!

01:21:51.883 --> 01:21:54.341
I think the victim was framed.

01:21:54.925 --> 01:21:56.383
Let's have a retrial.

01:21:57.675 --> 01:21:58.675
Don't force yourself.

01:21:58.758 --> 01:22:01.591
Not at all. Justice comes first.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.383
Pao Lung-sing, come forward.

01:22:05.175 --> 01:22:07.716
You're now appointed as the supreme judge.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.675
Together with the secretary
and the Navy commander,

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.633
retry the tragic case
of Chi family's annihilation.

01:22:12.216 --> 01:22:15.675
Panther, you'll guard Pao's life forever.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:18.091
You're appointed
as the great martial arts master.

01:22:18.175 --> 01:22:19.550
Go now with Pao.

01:22:19.633 --> 01:22:21.383
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:25.300
What's the rank of a supreme judge?

01:22:25.883 --> 01:22:26.883
First rank.

01:22:27.216 --> 01:22:28.758
Great!

01:22:29.925 --> 01:22:31.675
Your Majesty, thank you very much.

01:22:31.841 --> 01:22:33.925
I tried my best.
You should return the favor.

01:22:34.008 --> 01:22:35.258
Let's go to the brothel.

01:22:35.341 --> 01:22:36.383
Great!

01:22:54.425 --> 01:22:56.008
It's time. Chop!

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:08.716
Wait a minute!

01:23:09.591 --> 01:23:11.425
Don't listen to him. Do it!

01:23:16.216 --> 01:23:18.758
His Majesty's decree. Halt the sentence.

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:22.425
Take the criminal under custody.

01:23:22.675 --> 01:23:25.841
Wait for a retrial
by the supreme judge, Mr. Pao.

01:23:25.925 --> 01:23:29.383
Mr. Pao...

01:23:48.258 --> 01:23:52.091
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE

01:23:52.175 --> 01:23:55.133
Mr. Pao wants to prove
Mrs. Chi's innocence.

01:23:55.425 --> 01:23:56.675
Let's give him a hand.

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:01.050
Dad, I will reestablish
our reputation today.

01:24:03.008 --> 01:24:05.258
-What's wrong?
-Why do you look so sunburned?

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:06.925
Uncle wants to be tanned like Pao Ching.

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.800
That's why we had a tan.
Am I right, Uncle?

01:24:08.883 --> 01:24:11.133
Uncle. How come you're not tanned?

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.800
I wore a mask while sunbathing.
I just need this mark.

01:24:15.966 --> 01:24:17.758
How come you look like an African chicken?

01:24:18.425 --> 01:24:19.675
I was fooled by you.

01:24:24.758 --> 01:24:27.800
The murder case of 13 Chi family members

01:24:27.883 --> 01:24:31.716
will be retried by three departments.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.925
The presiding judge would be
the supreme judge, Pao Lung-sing.

01:24:35.716 --> 01:24:38.300
Joining the retrial, we have
the judicial secretary, Mr. Fa,

01:24:38.383 --> 01:24:41.716
the Navy commander, Mr. Shang,
and me, Mr. Chan.

01:24:42.008 --> 01:24:44.008
Keep quiet in court!

01:24:51.466 --> 01:24:53.966
Today, no one's allowed
to speak profanity.

01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:56.341
You can't curse at each other's parents
or mention any sex organ.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.966
I should be granted special rights.

01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:00.508
All right, you can curse only
at each other's mom.

01:25:00.591 --> 01:25:01.466
Damn your mom.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.050
Uncle, you'll win for sure.

01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:07.925
Bird's nest, Uncle.

01:25:10.425 --> 01:25:14.008
This supreme judge only has a bigger desk.
Don't worry. Just fight him.

01:25:14.341 --> 01:25:15.300
Exercise your mouth.

01:25:18.008 --> 01:25:19.091
Don't worry.

01:25:19.175 --> 01:25:22.508
Eunuch Lee is on our side.
Try your best to beat him.

01:25:22.591 --> 01:25:23.466
You'll get him.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.508
-Your--
-What?

01:25:39.591 --> 01:25:41.300
-I mean Your Honor.
-What's your honor?

01:25:41.383 --> 01:25:43.133
-Can't I call you that?
-You can, but no staring.

01:25:43.216 --> 01:25:44.800
-Did I stare?
-You stared at me.

01:25:44.883 --> 01:25:46.091
You knew because you stared first.

01:25:46.175 --> 01:25:48.258
I can call you a slut,
but you can't stare at me.

01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:50.883
How dare you call me a slut?
I'll report to His Majesty!

01:25:50.966 --> 01:25:52.925
Slut!

01:25:54.591 --> 01:25:56.800
You can't do this.
He's appointed by His Majesty.

01:25:56.883 --> 01:25:57.883
Damn your mom.

01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:00.508
-You can't curse in court--
-Damn your mom.

01:26:00.591 --> 01:26:03.591
You don't have to go that far.

01:26:03.675 --> 01:26:07.133
Damn your mom's mom!

01:26:07.883 --> 01:26:08.883
You are a slut!

01:26:08.966 --> 01:26:10.591
I'm here to retry the case.

01:26:10.675 --> 01:26:13.216
I didn't summon you yet.
But you wanted to get scolded.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.508
Do you deserve this?
Tell me. Do you deserve this?

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:19.800
You can't leave.

01:26:24.216 --> 01:26:26.216
Yet you claim you're an expert.

01:26:27.508 --> 01:26:29.841
Why did you step out?
Guilt? Ulterior motive?

01:26:29.925 --> 01:26:30.800
Tell me which one.

01:26:30.883 --> 01:26:33.425
I came with the others for fun.
I just stepped out a bit.

01:26:33.508 --> 01:26:36.341
-All right, I'll take a step back.
-Cut the crap. Step back!

01:26:36.466 --> 01:26:38.133
Stand behind the yellow line!

01:26:38.216 --> 01:26:39.300
Stand.

01:26:39.466 --> 01:26:42.008
I'm here. So what?

01:26:42.466 --> 01:26:43.508
Shit, I step out again.

01:26:43.591 --> 01:26:45.883
Shit, I step back again. So what?

01:26:45.966 --> 01:26:47.716
Are you going to beat me?

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800
All right!

01:26:58.258 --> 01:27:00.425
You all heard that he asked for it.

01:27:00.508 --> 01:27:02.841
I've never heard of a request like this.

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.800
Sir, we should question Mrs. Chi first.

01:27:11.633 --> 01:27:13.883
Mrs. Chi. What do you have to say?

01:27:13.966 --> 01:27:15.925
The judicial secretary
and I will seek justice for you.

01:27:16.008 --> 01:27:18.800
Sir, it's all under your control.
I'm just an assistant.

01:27:19.383 --> 01:27:22.425
My family was murdered

01:27:23.091 --> 01:27:24.508
by Shang Wai

01:27:25.966 --> 01:27:27.341
and I was raped by him too.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.175
Please help me, Your Honor.

01:27:29.716 --> 01:27:30.883
Summon Shang Wai!

01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:35.716
Your Honors.

01:27:36.966 --> 01:27:37.841
Mr. Shang.

01:27:38.383 --> 01:27:40.300
How did her family die?

01:27:42.008 --> 01:27:43.050
She killed them.

01:27:43.716 --> 01:27:46.425
Summon the drugstore keeper
and the coroner.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800
-Your Honor.
-Your Honor.

01:27:48.883 --> 01:27:49.758
Chu Yee.

01:27:50.175 --> 01:27:53.133
In your last statement, Mrs. Chi
bought arsenic from your store, right?

01:27:53.758 --> 01:27:54.800
Yes, Your Honor.

01:27:55.508 --> 01:27:56.383
Coroner.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.841
You testified that the sweet soup
contained poison, right?

01:27:59.925 --> 01:28:01.050
Yes, Your Honor.

01:28:04.675 --> 01:28:07.758
Everyone, there are sweet soup
and a catty of arsenic in here.

01:28:08.008 --> 01:28:10.841
If we pour them in, it'll be too sticky.

01:28:10.925 --> 01:28:12.966
Do you think
anyone would want to eat this?

01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:15.591
Maybe the Chi family was stupid.
We can't do anything about that.

01:28:15.675 --> 01:28:16.716
Would you like to try some?

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.466
It's wonderful.
Drink it, then you can fly.

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:20.425
Help.

01:28:20.508 --> 01:28:22.508
You're stupid too but you won't drink it.

01:28:22.591 --> 01:28:24.508
Do you think Chi family
would be more stupid than you?

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:28.425
Maybe she didn't put all the arsenic.

01:28:28.508 --> 01:28:30.508
So, where did the rest go?

01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:32.633
I searched the area and I didn't find it.

01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:35.383
If she didn't need that much,

01:28:35.466 --> 01:28:37.800
why would she buy that much
to arouse the suspicion of others?

01:28:38.675 --> 01:28:41.800
So the truth is you lied!

01:28:42.341 --> 01:28:43.675
I didn't lie, Your Honor.

01:28:43.925 --> 01:28:44.800
Really?

01:28:45.591 --> 01:28:47.175
We stole this account book from you.

01:28:47.258 --> 01:28:48.925
Not many people buy arsenic.

01:28:49.008 --> 01:28:50.883
You only ordered half a catty of arsenic.

01:28:50.966 --> 01:28:52.633
Yet, you said you sold her
a catty of arsenic!

01:28:53.425 --> 01:28:55.341
-Your Honor, I remembered wrongly.
-Did you?

01:28:55.633 --> 01:28:58.008
How about a few months ago
when you testified?

01:28:58.091 --> 01:28:59.508
You always remembered wrongly!

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:02.966
-Great martial arts master.
-Yes, sir.

01:29:03.258 --> 01:29:06.133
I asked you to examine the bodies.
What did you discover?

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:07.508
Please turn around.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.883
Your Honor, look.

01:29:10.966 --> 01:29:13.550
Only the throats turned black.

01:29:13.633 --> 01:29:15.133
The rest of their bodies looked normal.

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:18.675
According to my 30 years
of constable experience,

01:29:18.925 --> 01:29:21.091
someone must've poured poison
into their mouths.

01:29:21.175 --> 01:29:24.466
So, the poison
didn't reach their stomachs.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.550
All the corpses had a serious fracture.

01:29:27.675 --> 01:29:29.675
Their heads were put back
together with nails.

01:29:30.008 --> 01:29:33.300
I think the murderer
must be skilled in martial arts.

01:29:33.925 --> 01:29:36.216
After the tragedy, someone did a cover-up.

01:29:36.591 --> 01:29:38.133
Shang Wai. Did you hear it?

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.675
Sir, I have something to say.

01:29:40.883 --> 01:29:44.591
He just said they were killed
by a martial arts expert.

01:29:44.758 --> 01:29:46.341
But Mr. Shang doesn't know martial arts.

01:29:46.425 --> 01:29:47.758
How can you prove he murdered them?

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:50.716
If he doesn't know martial arts,
why was it so hard to arrest him?

01:29:50.883 --> 01:29:52.216
I was born strong.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.425
Really? Someone, punish him.

01:29:54.508 --> 01:29:55.425
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.300
<i>If you don't resist, we'll break you.</i>

01:30:02.383 --> 01:30:04.341
<i>If you resist,
it means you know martial arts.</i>

01:30:04.425 --> 01:30:06.758
Eunuch Lee arrives!

01:30:07.966 --> 01:30:08.925
Godfather.

01:30:11.383 --> 01:30:13.300
-Eunuch Lee.
-Lin-ying.

01:30:13.383 --> 01:30:14.925
Thank you for working hard.

01:30:15.383 --> 01:30:17.425
I came to listen to the trial.

01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:20.925
I also brought something
for Wai, my godson.

01:30:21.508 --> 01:30:22.508
Godfather.

01:30:23.216 --> 01:30:24.758
Behave yourself.

01:30:24.966 --> 01:30:29.216
If you commit any crimes,
I'll punish you too.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:34.341
But if anyone wants
to bully and frame you.

01:30:35.466 --> 01:30:37.758
I'll back you up.

01:30:38.675 --> 01:30:40.716
-Of course.
-Of course.

01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:44.841
This is from the empress dowager.

01:30:45.383 --> 01:30:49.216
If you wear it, nobody is allowed
to hit you except His Majesty.

01:30:49.466 --> 01:30:52.216
No one is allowed to hurt you.

01:30:54.425 --> 01:30:55.633
Your Honor.

01:30:59.383 --> 01:31:01.800
Uncle, we can't beat him.
What should we do?

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.675
How wise!

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:07.216
Your Honor.
Maybe they weren't poisoned to death.

01:31:07.466 --> 01:31:10.591
But Mrs. Chi might've hired
an assassin to murder them.

01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:14.758
The time reporter also saw
Wai got beaten up too.

01:31:14.925 --> 01:31:17.800
We should punish Mrs. Chi
to make her confess.

01:31:18.133 --> 01:31:20.633
Someone, punish Mrs. Chi!

01:31:20.716 --> 01:31:22.175
You're so wise.

01:31:22.258 --> 01:31:25.258
I admire your flattering ability.

01:31:25.341 --> 01:31:28.050
-Mr. Pao, what do you mean?
-Nothing serious.

01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:29.466
I'll say something else.

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.008
-You--
-Don't mention my mom.

01:31:31.091 --> 01:31:36.841
Who said he wants to use punishment?

01:31:37.633 --> 01:31:40.508
Mr. Pao, you don't have to distract us.

01:31:40.591 --> 01:31:43.175
Prepare her for the punishment.

01:31:43.258 --> 01:31:44.175
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:46.716
Wait a moment!

01:31:47.133 --> 01:31:49.341
Why should we listen to you? I object!

01:31:49.425 --> 01:31:50.383
What?

01:31:50.966 --> 01:31:54.341
Mr. Pao, you're very bureaucratic.

01:31:54.758 --> 01:31:56.591
If we let you get promoted in future,

01:31:56.675 --> 01:32:00.466
you won't even respect
the empress dowager.

01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:01.925
Of course not.

01:32:02.008 --> 01:32:04.008
I respect Her Highness
from the bottom of my heart.

01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:06.383
Unlike you, who always talk
but don't respect her.

01:32:06.466 --> 01:32:07.508
What's your goal?

01:32:07.591 --> 01:32:09.133
-You--
-You weren't filial to your mom

01:32:09.216 --> 01:32:10.883
by becoming a eunuch.

01:32:10.966 --> 01:32:13.216
You're not loyal because
you don't respect the empress dowager.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.133
So, why is a disloyal
and unfilial guy sitting here?

01:32:15.216 --> 01:32:19.008
How dare you talk like this?
You dare to scold me!

01:32:19.091 --> 01:32:21.341
I'm the supreme judge.
I'm the most powerful here.

01:32:21.425 --> 01:32:24.300
You're just a fifth-ranking official,
a housekeeper of the royal family.

01:32:24.383 --> 01:32:27.133
I'm standing. How dare you sit there?
I must teach you some manners.

01:32:27.216 --> 01:32:29.508
Okay, I'll report to His Majesty
and kill your entire--

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:30.841
Damn your dad.

01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:32.550
Go ahead if you can walk out of here.

01:32:32.633 --> 01:32:34.383
Shut the door! Release the dogs.

01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:40.758
-Mr. Pao!
-Mr. Pao!

01:32:41.175 --> 01:32:43.216
I can handle this by myself.

01:32:45.258 --> 01:32:47.675
I won't argue with you.
Get back to the trial.

01:32:47.758 --> 01:32:48.966
All right. Asshole.

01:32:49.050 --> 01:32:51.258
-Who do you mean?
-Whoever answers me.

01:32:51.466 --> 01:32:53.841
You bastard. I'll ignore you.

01:32:53.925 --> 01:32:54.800
You're a maniac.

01:32:55.425 --> 01:32:58.091
Damn you! Damn your family!

01:32:58.175 --> 01:32:59.758
Go to hell!

01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:00.758
Sissy asshole.

01:33:14.383 --> 01:33:15.300
Sir.

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:18.175
Mr. Pao is buying time.
Let's scare the witnesses.

01:33:18.258 --> 01:33:19.675
-Go.
-Yes.

01:33:26.925 --> 01:33:29.425
-Isn't that the coroner?
-How come he's beaten up like this?

01:33:29.508 --> 01:33:32.383
Mr. Pao found out
that he made false testimony.

01:33:32.591 --> 01:33:35.258
He accepted bribery and framed the lady.

01:33:35.341 --> 01:33:37.050
So, we beat him up.

01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:43.300
The drugstore keeper, Chu Yee,
was cut into two by Mr. Pao.

01:33:45.675 --> 01:33:47.008
It hurts!

01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:50.300
Help me! What are you doing?

01:33:50.383 --> 01:33:51.925
It hurts! It hurts so much!

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:54.300
I can't walk. I can't move.

01:33:54.383 --> 01:33:56.925
-Don't tell lies.
-Don't come close.

01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:59.800
It hurts! Help me.

01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:04.175
What are you doing? Go away!
Someone help me.

01:34:04.633 --> 01:34:06.758
What are you doing down there?

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:10.008
I want to write the word, miserable.

01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:12.716
I can't read. Don't bother me.

01:34:14.675 --> 01:34:15.800
I'm dead.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:17.008
It's your turn.

01:34:21.508 --> 01:34:22.716
You have a lemon head, rat face,

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.425
sloping eyebrows, eagle nose,
elephant ears,

01:34:24.508 --> 01:34:27.258
big mouth, yellow teeth, pig legs,
uneven hands and arms,

01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:29.050
chicken chest, dog belly,
and a large waist.

01:34:29.133 --> 01:34:30.841
If I were you, I'd rather die.

01:34:30.925 --> 01:34:32.716
-I...
-You took off your pants before sleep.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.091
Your body has butt markings.
You deserve to be pierced by a stick.

01:34:35.175 --> 01:34:37.216
Damn you.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.216
Eunuch Lee, are you okay?
Come and take a seat.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.133
Go to hell!

01:34:44.466 --> 01:34:46.800
Why don't you punish her, Mr. Pao?

01:34:46.883 --> 01:34:50.050
You argued for a few hours.
Are you buying time?

01:34:52.008 --> 01:34:53.800
Of course not. Go on.

01:34:54.675 --> 01:34:56.716
Summon the time reporter,
Loi-fook and the gynecologist.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:59.258
Your Honor!
We're willing to tell the truth.

01:34:59.466 --> 01:35:02.300
One by one, let's question Mrs. Chi first.

01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:04.633
That's right. It's not your turn yet.

01:35:04.716 --> 01:35:06.425
Punish Mrs. Chi first.

01:35:13.966 --> 01:35:15.675
-It hurts so much.
-Are you pretending?

01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:20.050
It hurts. My baby is coming out.

01:35:20.133 --> 01:35:22.258
How dare you! You're clearly faking it.

01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:23.383
Someone, punish her!

01:35:23.466 --> 01:35:25.716
Hang on, let's ask
the gynecologist's opinion.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.175
She'll know after she examines her.

01:35:29.008 --> 01:35:30.008
It hurts.

01:35:30.216 --> 01:35:32.675
Your Honor, her baby is coming out.

01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.800
What do you think, Eunuch Lee?

01:35:34.966 --> 01:35:38.216
I'm not the judge. You all should decide.

01:35:38.383 --> 01:35:39.800
Let's vote.

01:35:39.883 --> 01:35:41.716
If you think she should be
punished now, hands up.

01:35:43.716 --> 01:35:45.716
-Three to one! Punish her!
-No way.

01:35:46.258 --> 01:35:48.716
Everybody can vote here.

01:35:48.966 --> 01:35:51.425
Hands up if you think
she should give birth first.

01:35:53.633 --> 01:35:57.050
-Let her give birth!
-Let her give birth!

01:35:57.133 --> 01:36:01.300
-Let her give birth!
-Let her give birth!

01:36:01.383 --> 01:36:03.050
-Let her give birth!
-Let her give birth!

01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:09.383
-Let her give birth!
-Let her give birth!

01:36:09.466 --> 01:36:10.633
What do you think, Mr. Shang?

01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:13.091
We can't offend the public.

01:36:13.175 --> 01:36:14.216
Let her give birth then.

01:36:15.091 --> 01:36:16.966
All right, Mrs. Chi is permitted
to give birth first.

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.966
-Be careful.
-It hurts!

01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:24.966
Time reporter. There was
something wrong with your testimony.

01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:27.133
I'll give you another chance
to tell the truth.

01:36:27.216 --> 01:36:28.841
What did you really see on that day?

01:36:28.925 --> 01:36:30.675
I...

01:36:35.633 --> 01:36:38.508
I saw Shang Wai beating Loi-fook.

01:36:38.591 --> 01:36:41.216
So, the Chi family's dog
attacked Shang Wai.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.425
But Shang Wai kicked the dog to death.

01:36:43.508 --> 01:36:46.175
Loi-fook got away. I tried to escape too.

01:36:46.258 --> 01:36:48.383
But Shang kicked me hard, and I fainted.

01:36:50.091 --> 01:36:51.966
Why didn't you say this last time?

01:36:52.050 --> 01:36:54.466
Because Mr. Fong gave me
500 taels to give false testimony.

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:55.800
Your Honor, please don't kill me.

01:36:55.883 --> 01:36:56.800
Don't lie!

01:36:57.008 --> 01:36:58.883
Do you mean everyone's lying?

01:36:58.966 --> 01:37:00.966
Loi-fook, what did you see on that night?

01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:01.925
I forgot.

01:37:02.008 --> 01:37:03.758
Did you commit adultery with Mrs. Chi?

01:37:03.841 --> 01:37:05.591
Did she ask you
to murder the whole family?

01:37:05.675 --> 01:37:08.425
No, I only had an affair with her.

01:37:08.508 --> 01:37:10.841
You said Mrs. Chi was fond of you
because of your literacy talent.

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:13.008
-She even wrote you a love poem, right?
-Yes!

01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:15.050
Bring him the love poem.

01:37:15.591 --> 01:37:17.008
Could you read it again?

01:37:17.091 --> 01:37:19.800
"Ever since we met,
I know we are two of a kind.

01:37:19.883 --> 01:37:22.883
Who cares how long we can be together?
We should just enjoy our time."

01:37:23.716 --> 01:37:24.925
A few words are missing, right?

01:37:25.008 --> 01:37:27.841
The is a different poem,
<i>Quiet Night Thought</i>. You idiot!

01:37:28.341 --> 01:37:29.466
What word is this?

01:37:30.966 --> 01:37:32.508
You can't even read the word, dead!

01:37:32.591 --> 01:37:35.175
You can't even read.
How dare you frame her?

01:37:35.258 --> 01:37:36.133
Someone, kill him now.

01:37:36.216 --> 01:37:37.341
No, Your Honor. It's not me.

01:37:37.425 --> 01:37:39.966
Mr. Fong gave me 5,000 taels
to frame Mrs. Chi.

01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:42.008
I still have 3,000 taels at home.

01:37:42.091 --> 01:37:43.508
Bastard. How dare you betray me?

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:45.175
You committed adultery!
Kill him, Your Honor!

01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:47.841
Your Honor, it's not my fault.
I have evidence.

01:37:47.925 --> 01:37:50.258
I can never have an affair with Mrs. Chi.

01:37:50.341 --> 01:37:51.508
I'll show you.

01:37:51.841 --> 01:37:53.466
-Show us then.
-Okay.

01:37:57.758 --> 01:38:00.341
I was born in a poor family
so I castrated myself.

01:38:00.425 --> 01:38:01.675
I wanted to be a eunuch.

01:38:01.758 --> 01:38:04.258
But I didn't have money
to bribe the eunuch so I failed.

01:38:04.633 --> 01:38:06.175
Then I went to work for the Chi family.

01:38:06.675 --> 01:38:08.633
So, I can't have an affair with Mrs. Chi.

01:38:10.008 --> 01:38:11.300
Another damn eunuch.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.508
Save it. I don't mean you.

01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:15.966
All right.

01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:18.216
Let's strip Mr. Fong of his title first.

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.258
Let's try his bribery crimes later.

01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:21.425
What do you think?

01:38:21.508 --> 01:38:23.216
Sure, whatever you say.

01:38:24.258 --> 01:38:25.133
Fong Tong-kan!

01:38:25.216 --> 01:38:27.133
You better tell the truth.

01:38:27.216 --> 01:38:29.216
I'll consider reducing
your punishment. Spill it!

01:38:31.633 --> 01:38:34.550
Fong Tong-kan and Loi-fook
are guilty of bribery,

01:38:34.925 --> 01:38:36.800
so they should be sentenced to death.

01:38:38.841 --> 01:38:40.341
-You're so vicious.
-You're so vicious.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.175
How dare you. Slap them.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.008
Uncle, they were seriously hurt.
So we don't have any witnesses now.

01:38:56.091 --> 01:39:00.133
Sing, I brought the sword of state to you.

01:39:00.591 --> 01:39:01.466
Mom, you...

01:39:01.716 --> 01:39:04.841
-Here.
-Grandma, stop playing. We are busy.

01:39:04.925 --> 01:39:06.966
Take the salted fish away.

01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:09.341
This is not a salted fish. It's real.

01:39:10.633 --> 01:39:11.633
Sword of state?

01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:16.050
Uncle, you better be sure. Maybe it's...

01:39:17.675 --> 01:39:20.508
-It's really the sword of state!
-It's really the sword of state!

01:39:20.591 --> 01:39:23.550
Shang Wai, do you think
I couldn't beat you up?

01:39:23.716 --> 01:39:26.216
In front of me, you can't deny it.

01:39:26.466 --> 01:39:28.591
I will chop your fingers off
with my sword.

01:39:28.675 --> 01:39:30.091
Are you going to confess now?

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:34.050
Asshole, get lost.

01:39:34.133 --> 01:39:36.300
My sword can kill corrupted kings
and vicious officials.

01:39:36.383 --> 01:39:38.091
-I don't want to hurt you.
-Since the reign of the Qing Dynasty,

01:39:38.175 --> 01:39:39.841
I've never heard of the sword of state.

01:39:40.258 --> 01:39:41.258
What's this sword?

01:39:42.175 --> 01:39:44.758
This is not a common sword.
Of course, you wouldn't know.

01:39:44.841 --> 01:39:45.800
Grandma, tell them!

01:39:45.883 --> 01:39:48.050
Which emperor granted this sword
to our Pao family?

01:39:48.508 --> 01:39:50.508
It's granted by Emperor Sung-ching
of the Ming Dynasty.

01:39:50.966 --> 01:39:52.050
The Ming Dynasty?

01:39:52.341 --> 01:39:54.633
Are you using this sword to hurt
an official of the Qing Dynasty?

01:39:55.675 --> 01:39:57.050
Is this a rebellion?

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.966
In fact, the atmosphere is too tense.

01:40:00.050 --> 01:40:01.508
My mom and I wanted to do something

01:40:01.591 --> 01:40:04.050
to ease up the tension.
Would you mind that?

01:40:04.133 --> 01:40:06.175
If you swallow it,
I'll think you're fooling around.

01:40:09.175 --> 01:40:11.216
Sure, I'll do it.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.883
Thank you! You're too kind, everyone.

01:40:27.175 --> 01:40:29.716
It's fine now.
Let's get back to the trial.

01:40:32.883 --> 01:40:35.091
I'll let it go then.

01:40:36.466 --> 01:40:38.841
If you don't show any evidence
to accuse Shang Wai,

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:40.425
you have to adjourn.

01:40:40.925 --> 01:40:43.508
Then Wai will be acquitted.

01:40:46.925 --> 01:40:48.425
Hey, the baby is born!

01:40:48.508 --> 01:40:49.966
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:51.550
Stop fooling around. Decide it now.

01:40:51.675 --> 01:40:53.133
Well, we have no choice

01:40:53.883 --> 01:40:56.633
but to do a blood test.

01:40:56.841 --> 01:40:58.508
-Blood test?
-Blood test?

01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.716
That's right!

01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:03.758
Scare him first.

01:41:04.716 --> 01:41:07.133
Shang Wai, you said
you didn't rape the plaintiff.

01:41:07.258 --> 01:41:08.841
So, her baby must be unrelated to you.

01:41:08.925 --> 01:41:10.716
Your blood won't conglomerate
with the baby's blood.

01:41:10.883 --> 01:41:13.550
If you take the blood test,
you can prove you're innocent.

01:41:13.675 --> 01:41:15.883
If you don't take the test,
you must be the rapist!

01:41:17.633 --> 01:41:18.633
Go ahead.

01:41:20.508 --> 01:41:21.466
I fear nothing.

01:41:44.591 --> 01:41:46.800
It conglomerated!
You must be the murderer!

01:41:49.591 --> 01:41:52.425
You raped her and killed her family.
You can't deny it now.

01:41:52.508 --> 01:41:54.216
Someone, prepare the guillotine!

01:41:56.008 --> 01:41:58.383
Impossible.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.758
Godfather, the kid isn't mine.

01:42:02.841 --> 01:42:04.508
It isn't mine. Godfather!

01:42:04.633 --> 01:42:06.633
-I am here. Don't panic!
-You have to help me!

01:42:06.716 --> 01:42:08.925
If you weren't the rapist,
why would the blood conglomerate?

01:42:09.008 --> 01:42:11.133
That must be your kid!
There's no other explanation!

01:42:11.216 --> 01:42:12.091
He's not my kid!

01:42:12.175 --> 01:42:14.133
After I screwed her that night,
how can she get pregnant the next day?

01:42:14.258 --> 01:42:15.300
That's impossible!

01:42:16.925 --> 01:42:19.258
-So, you screwed her!
-So, you screwed her!

01:42:22.175 --> 01:42:26.550
You bastard. How dare you lie to me?

01:42:26.633 --> 01:42:28.341
Are you happy? That's the truth.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.050
I won't back you up anymore!

01:42:31.133 --> 01:42:32.175
Please give way!

01:42:32.466 --> 01:42:34.050
Dear, what happened?

01:42:34.133 --> 01:42:35.383
Dear, why are you here?

01:42:35.466 --> 01:42:37.341
You and Father told me to bring our son.

01:42:37.716 --> 01:42:38.883
Was that my son?

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.591
You meant that was my son.

01:42:45.091 --> 01:42:48.175
You bastard! How dare you trick me!

01:42:48.841 --> 01:42:50.341
So what?

01:42:50.425 --> 01:42:52.966
Cut the crap!
Shut the door and let the dogs out.

01:42:53.925 --> 01:42:55.425
I don't care! I'm leaving.

01:42:55.508 --> 01:42:56.716
Godfather!

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.966
-Don't come over.
-Bastard, do you want to rebel?

01:43:04.216 --> 01:43:05.966
I told you he knows martial arts.

01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:07.508
You better confess now.

01:43:07.841 --> 01:43:09.300
Stand back! I'll kill him.

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.841
Eunuch Lee, thank you
for sacrificing yourself.

01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:14.050
I will report to His Majesty
and give you a grand funeral.

01:43:14.133 --> 01:43:15.675
Close the door. Let the dogs out!

01:43:17.216 --> 01:43:18.216
Don't come over.

01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:25.758
Panther, throw him here.

01:43:26.841 --> 01:43:28.758
Your Honor, it's me!

01:43:28.841 --> 01:43:31.091
I know. Go and fight again,
great martial arts master.

01:43:40.591 --> 01:43:42.466
FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE

01:43:46.216 --> 01:43:48.383
You dragged me down.

01:43:48.466 --> 01:43:50.175
Stop talking or I'll kick you to death!

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:53.425
I beg you, sir. Don't swing the carriage.

01:43:53.508 --> 01:43:55.675
I'm getting motion sickness.

01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.925
Congratulations, Mr. Pao.

01:44:01.425 --> 01:44:03.008
Thank you!

01:44:03.091 --> 01:44:04.966
I'm no longer an official.

01:44:05.050 --> 01:44:07.383
Why did you open a drugstore
and quit your post?

01:44:07.466 --> 01:44:09.550
I don't think you'll understand anyway.

01:44:09.633 --> 01:44:12.258
Look at Stone Mansion and Yu Yin.

01:44:12.758 --> 01:44:16.258
-Dear! Be careful. Let me kiss them.
-Mrs. Pao.

01:44:17.091 --> 01:44:22.050
I gave my late husband's
hereditary nostrum to Mr. Pao.

01:44:22.133 --> 01:44:24.716
After taking the medicine,
he got both of his wives pregnant.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.633
Now, he's going to use it in his business.

01:44:26.716 --> 01:44:29.008
INDIA'S MIRACULOUS CURE

01:44:29.175 --> 01:44:31.050
It's from India.

01:44:31.883 --> 01:44:35.091
I could have such great achievements
because of His Majesty.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.841
I miss him so much.

01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:39.550
Luckily, I have his royal underwear
as my collection.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.800
I feel great after smelling it.
It gives me strength.

01:44:43.883 --> 01:44:46.258
It's of good taste too.

01:44:46.341 --> 01:44:48.133
Don't miss out.

01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:49.716
The royal duke has arrived.

01:44:52.925 --> 01:44:56.425
Welcome, Your Grace.

01:44:56.508 --> 01:44:59.800
Mr. Pao, I couldn't congratulate you.

01:45:00.383 --> 01:45:01.716
I've to tell you a piece of bad news.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.841
His Majesty passed away.

01:45:04.591 --> 01:45:06.008
His Majesty!

01:45:07.508 --> 01:45:11.133
Why did this happen?

01:45:11.883 --> 01:45:13.341
Why did His Majesty pass away?

01:45:14.216 --> 01:45:16.091
-A sickness.
-What kind of sickness?

01:45:17.675 --> 01:45:19.300
It is syphilis!
