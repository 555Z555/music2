00:01:48.582 --> 00:01:50.082

00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.957
Pull me up, please.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.166
So troublesome, coming.

00:01:56.624 --> 00:01:57.166
Thanks.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.582
Hold it.

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:01.999
Fool me?

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.707
You are going to break my arm.

00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:16.832
Bastard.

00:02:20.624 --> 00:02:21.874
Bastard.

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.582
Go to hell!

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.457
To hell!

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.207
Poisoned!

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.541
Dead?

00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:35.499
Who are you?

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.666
Don't get closs, I fight back.

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.332
Morning!

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:43.791
I am the handsome tricky Jing Koo.

00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:46.541
So it's you.

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:48.832
What a trap.

00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:51.707
Of course, that's what I am good at.

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:53.707
I have to charge you from now.

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:54.749
$8.00 to start with.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.207
That's nothing.

00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:58.707
I can keep on till tomorrow.

00:02:58.707 --> 00:03:00.624
I mean $80,000.

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:02.749
$80,000, what a rip off.

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:04.749
Yes, it is.

00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:08.541
Don't waste the time.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:09.666
Clear?

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:10.332
Clear.

00:03:10.332 --> 00:03:12.207
You want a divorce but keep your property.

00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:14.749
Not problem to make her mad.

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.166
Really?

00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:18.832
Of course.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.707
What?

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:24.291
I'll charge you $300,000 for sure win.

00:03:24.374 --> 00:03:28.332
$300,0007? I thought $30,000 to $50,000.

00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:29.791
Calm down, have a drink.

00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:31.207
Thanks.

00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:35.041
You have mine & I have yours.

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.082
Feeling sick?

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.749
Yes, how do you know?

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:44.124
It has good dose.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.874
You have it too.

00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:47.666
Not now.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:50.082
The toilet is over there.

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:50.749
Thanks.

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:51.707
Please.

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:57.916
Not yet, lock the door.

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:00.582
No, don't come in.

00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:05.166
What about the charge of $500,0007?

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:07.041
We agreed $300,000.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.332
Wrong, now $600,000.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.124
$600,0007?

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:14.499
Rip off?

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.582
I wanna show you my talent.

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.791
$700,000 not a problem.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.666
What $700,0007

00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:28.041
Let me out or I chop you up.

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:29.041
I'll chop you up.

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:31.791
$700,000 is not a great deal.

00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:33.582
$70m. is not a problem neither
if you have to pay.

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:39.791
$70m? No argument, I'll pay, let me out.

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.041
Let me out, quick.

00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:44.416
Thanks for your co-operation.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:46.582
I only have to pull this switch.

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:48.166
All get up will back off.

00:04:48.624 --> 00:04:53.666
Hay, what to do now?

00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:55.749
I have to turn off the main switch.

00:04:55.874 --> 00:04:57.624
Where is it?

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:59.291
In Yuen Long.

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:02.791
My God, let me out.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.541
Quick.

00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.582
Oh!

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.791
What ashame.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.041
Congratulations.

00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:31.374
Kung Hay Fai Choi...

00:05:37.582 --> 00:05:40.291
Stupid.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.499
Mrs. Chu, if all goes right,

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.582
your husband will be sent to the
Mental Hospital in 15 mins.

00:05:46.582 --> 00:05:49.582
It worths $800,000.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:52.041
You deserve it.

00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:54.707
Lucky that I was quick.

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:59.207
If not I could be the one to turn mad.

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:02.874
Not may be, but surely would be you.

00:06:05.957 --> 00:06:07.666
You are an expert.

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:08.707
Wrong.

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:13.374
I am handsome Tricky Expert.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:19.541
Can I have a kiss

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.416
for memory?

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.749
More than happy.

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:29.457
"Tricky Expert"

00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:33.457
Thanks.

00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:34.499
Don't mention it.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:35.666
Bye.

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.916
On the house.

00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.249
Give me the file later.

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:44.207
O.K.

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:45.791
What about the goods?

00:06:46.124 --> 00:06:47.082
Get in!

00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:51.041
Hay, what's going on?

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:52.874
A woman has lost a diamond ring.

00:06:52.874 --> 00:06:54.999
The police has to search the department.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:56.957
Get a drawer and queue.

00:06:56.957 --> 00:06:57.582
Oh! Hold it!

00:06:57.582 --> 00:06:58.832
Hay...

00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:03.999
Hay, you, come over.

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:05.957
Me?

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:08.082
Yes, come over.

00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.374
Madam, what's matter?

00:07:09.374 --> 00:07:11.249
Quiet, search.

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:12.624
Search girls here.

00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:13.999
We have finished with the girls.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.666
Hurry up, you asshole!

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:16.332
Really?

00:07:16.332 --> 00:07:18.832
Are you man? Come on.

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:23.582
This way.

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:27.291
Don't move.

00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:32.666
Watch out.

00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:36.416
Here we are.

00:07:39.082 --> 00:07:41.916
You are so strong.

00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:44.082
- Thanks.
- Take off your shirt.

00:07:44.082 --> 00:07:44.916
What?

00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:46.957
You have searched me, why?

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.624
You are so afraid of woman.

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:51.916
Virgin?

00:07:51.916 --> 00:07:52.666
Yes.

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:56.749
No, you ask funny questions.

00:07:56.957 --> 00:08:00.207
You can take advantage.

00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:05.666
Stand clear, or I shout.

00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:07.832
Don't get close, or I yell.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.791
Congratulations, Kit, you are promoted.

00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:15.332
Congratulation!

00:08:15.332 --> 00:08:16.374
You all know about it.

00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:17.249
Of course.

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:20.124
That's why we fooled you with the girl.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.957
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:22.957 --> 00:08:24.207
Banana's idea.

00:08:24.207 --> 00:08:25.832
I dared not to say or she'll not date with me.

00:08:25.832 --> 00:08:26.791
Hay!

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:29.124
She's not going out with you anyway.

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:33.541
Come, open the champagne.

00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:35.582
It is great that he got promotion

00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:37.082
So let's celebration

00:08:45.624 --> 00:08:48.999
Who's that girl who searched me?

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:51.707
Whore, cost $3,000-

00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:54.832
Banana is really tricky.

00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:58.124
Banana is famous of this.

00:08:58.124 --> 00:09:00.666
She's very pride.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.666
She won't fool people once only.

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:05.957
Always more than once.

00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:07.166
She such a devil.

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:09.499
You better watch out.

00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:29.374
Her tricks keep coming.

00:09:29.374 --> 00:09:31.624
But I'll be careful.

00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:41.332
Are you Mr. Chi Man Kit?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:43.666
Yes I am.

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:46.249
I am new from the Personnel Dept,
I want your info.

00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:48.999
Right, I have to go into the room.

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:50.832
That's good. It's too noisy here.

00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:53.207
Please!

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.124
Lock the door?

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:56.791
Good idea, too noisy outside.

00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:07.291
Do I have to get naked?

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.541
What? Help yourself!

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:15.624
Stand by the wall.

00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:17.499
No need.

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:18.957
Body search?

00:10:19.666 --> 00:10:20.791
Why?

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:23.582
Why are you doing this here?

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.124
What for?

00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:30.707
You are suitable for a lot of jobs.

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:34.832
Like China Town, Club Volvo, Metropolitan.

00:10:34.832 --> 00:10:37.041
Why be a whore here?

00:10:38.332 --> 00:10:41.541
Such a low class whore.

00:10:42.332 --> 00:10:46.707
Why be a whore here and hit people?

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:50.957
Hit people? Tell me why you hit people?

00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:51.832
What's wrong, Lucy?

00:10:51.832 --> 00:10:53.041
You ask him.

00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:54.791
- Insane.
- What's wrong?

00:10:54.832 --> 00:10:57.541
You employ such kind of employee.

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:00.041
I employ her? Which one?

00:11:00.457 --> 00:11:01.249
She!

00:11:01.249 --> 00:11:03.791
She's my old friend, just back from the States.

00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.041
Our new colleague.

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:06.499
New colleague?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.082
Who do you think she is?

00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:09.041
My God!

00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:14.332
Hay...Miss...

00:11:19.541 --> 00:11:23.416
I didn't mean it.

00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:16.416
Are you alright?

00:12:16.416 --> 00:12:17.624
Wait.

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:21.791
Fine.

00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:25.624
Hay...no.

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:28.957
I was trapped.
I didn't meant to present so rude.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:30.374
I am not the type you think off.

00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:31.541
No.

00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:33.124
I didn't have such an idea.

00:12:33.124 --> 00:12:34.499
You have agreed?

00:12:34.499 --> 00:12:35.749
Not yet.

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:39.832
Chi Man Kit, Lucy Ching, shake hands.

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:56.291
Hay.

00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.166
What?

00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:58.249
Look.

00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:01.707
You wanna buy them all?

00:13:01.707 --> 00:13:04.291
Not, quite, but you have known me for so long.

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.666
You have hidden something from me.

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:08.249
What are you talking about?

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.874
.U, , right?

00:13:13.874 --> 00:13:15.749
No.

00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:18.207
I O you.

00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:19.707
No.

00:13:19.707 --> 00:13:21.791
It really is I love you.

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:25.666
Women, trouble.

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:33.874
Lucy, your hair.

00:13:34.249 --> 00:13:36.166
Glue it up.

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:39.041
Let go over there.

00:13:40.082 --> 00:13:41.624
Are you in a hurry?

00:13:41.624 --> 00:13:44.999
Yes, I have to call Julian at 6.

00:13:47.666 --> 00:13:48.916
Which Julian?

00:13:49.416 --> 00:13:52.999
My fien'ce in the States,
Lucy knows about him too.

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:55.457
You see each other only twice a year.

00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:58.499
I take the maxicab there.

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:01.082
Fine! Bye!

00:14:01.082 --> 00:14:03.416
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:14:13.207 --> 00:14:14.666
Hay, get down.

00:14:22.874 --> 00:14:24.291
We nearly broke it.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.082
Let's go, quick.

00:14:26.624 --> 00:14:29.249
How much longer you want to hide it from Kit?

00:14:29.457 --> 00:14:32.541
I don't know. I can't project his reaction.

00:14:32.957 --> 00:14:35.041
Who thinks of such an idea.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:40.666
The boss' daughter works as a clerk
to know about the firm.

00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:44.041
It's very old fashioned idea.

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:45.999
You decide on the contract.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:46.749
Fine.

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:47.332
Hello!

00:14:47.332 --> 00:14:48.249
Lucy!

00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:50.124
Lucy!

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:50.916
Hi!

00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:52.124
Daddy!

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:55.582
Macky was talking about the Japan contract.

00:14:55.874 --> 00:14:57.916
Take you time, I have to get change.

00:15:00.457 --> 00:15:05.332
Lucy, you've changed after going to the States.

00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:08.416
We are busy.

00:15:08.666 --> 00:15:10.624
Lucy, I wanna talk to you.

00:15:10.624 --> 00:15:11.791
What, Daddy?

00:15:12.249 --> 00:15:16.249
Heard that you & Kit are going out.

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:20.332
Well, you are undercover to work in the firm

00:15:20.332 --> 00:15:24.332
to have a clear picture, I don't mind.

00:15:25.499 --> 00:15:28.957
But be careful with your love life.

00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:30.582
Who?

00:15:31.957 --> 00:15:34.374
You overheard us.

00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:38.041
Sorry, I was going to say, but no chance.

00:15:38.707 --> 00:15:39.666
Talk now.

00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:40.957
Kit is not a good fellow.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:42.874
Mind your word.

00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:45.249
I know it's been a long time.

00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:49.374
But a like fair chance.

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.166
I worry about you.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.332
What do you know?

00:15:53.624 --> 00:15:54.999
Kit has a bad background.

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:57.041
He joined triad since young.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.416
And then back to school.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.249
So he has turned good.

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.749
People can never change their character.

00:16:03.124 --> 00:16:05.624
He is interested in your money.

00:16:06.041 --> 00:16:07.999
He doesn't know my identity.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:10.499
I will pretend not knowing too.

00:16:10.916 --> 00:16:12.374
Mind you.

00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:15.124
You are blinded by your love.

00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:18.041
You'll soon see the real him.

00:16:25.916 --> 00:16:31.749
" Am sick for love."”

00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:37.416
Chi!

00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:39.374
Something wrong?

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.541
Remember before your wife died,

00:16:42.541 --> 00:16:46.124
one day I told you I was pregnant.

00:16:46.374 --> 00:16:49.041
Yeah, and I borrowed some money for you.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.082
Told you to have the abortion.

00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:53.916
I feel sorry now.

00:16:53.916 --> 00:16:56.124
I had lied to you.

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:58.791
What? That's not my baby?

00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:01.916
Of course it's your baby.

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:03.624
I didn't have the abortion.

00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:07.082
I gave birth in China and
my sister takes care of him.

00:17:07.374 --> 00:17:09.624
So I have a second son.

00:17:09.707 --> 00:17:11.499
He has got a single entry visa.

00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:12.791
True?

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:16.791
He is really like you.

00:17:16.874 --> 00:17:17.749
I take you to him.

00:17:17.749 --> 00:17:19.082
Good.

00:17:19.207 --> 00:17:21.791
He stays here?

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.582
How does he behaves like me?

00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:30.249
He behaves exactly like when you are nervous.

00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:33.207
Happy, when you want sex.

00:17:33.207 --> 00:17:34.082
Really?

00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:34.874
Behave.

00:17:34.874 --> 00:17:35.999
No.

00:17:36.416 --> 00:17:39.082
And he can take even hotter taste.

00:17:39.082 --> 00:17:40.541
Hot like fire.

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:41.749
He's great.

00:17:42.041 --> 00:17:44.499
That could be coincidence.

00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:47.082
But something must be of genetic.

00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:47.916
What?

00:17:48.082 --> 00:17:51.416
Remember Kit could not talk before 3.

00:17:51.416 --> 00:17:53.791
Right, I worried

00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.832
I thought he was dumb.

00:17:55.832 --> 00:17:58.791
And the first thing he said was "Dad".

00:17:58.791 --> 00:18:01.166
Oh!

00:18:01.957 --> 00:18:04.874
You still like this for years?

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:06.707
Yes, I always for this.

00:18:06.707 --> 00:18:08.457
The first time he called you "Dad".

00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:09.416
Quiet.

00:18:09.457 --> 00:18:11.541
You were very mad.

00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:13.332
Since then when he calls you Daddy.

00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:16.291
You'll lose control of your body.

00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:19.832
Right, so he calls me father.

00:18:20.374 --> 00:18:22.166
He is the same.

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:23.374
So magical?

00:18:23.374 --> 00:18:24.624
What is his name?

00:18:24.624 --> 00:18:26.166
Chi Man Ching!

00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:27.999
Chi Man...

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:29.041
He is back.

00:18:31.374 --> 00:18:32.624
Hide yourself.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:16.041
He likes rotten beancurd.

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:27.374
He can really talk hot stuff.

00:19:33.832 --> 00:19:37.374
He wants to sexually assault beancurd?

00:19:38.582 --> 00:19:39.541
Who?

00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.332
No one.

00:19:41.332 --> 00:19:42.291
Oh!

00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:44.832
You dare not to see your son?

00:19:55.624 --> 00:19:58.166
Son, your Dad.

00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:23.166
He's your...

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.082
- Father!
- Father!

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:30.624
Father...

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:35.666
Father!

00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:43.041
- Father...
- Father...

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.832
Good father & son reunion.

00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:49.291
My good son.

00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:50.499
Father...

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:51.874
Say Dad.

00:20:51.874 --> 00:20:52.791
Dad!

00:20:52.791 --> 00:20:53.666
More.

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:54.791
Dad...

00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:56.499
My son...

00:20:56.749 --> 00:20:59.124
Father will give you...

00:20:59.124 --> 00:20:59.916
A gold chain?

00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:03.207
No, a special string.

00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:04.582
Put it on your head.

00:21:06.582 --> 00:21:08.624
Smells nice, what's it made off?

00:21:08.624 --> 00:21:10.499
My won hair.

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:12.916
Thanks.

00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:14.582
Good.

00:21:17.916 --> 00:21:19.457
I have nothing for you.

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:21.291
A rotten beancurd, that's all.

00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:23.082
A gift for you.

00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:24.666
You take it.

00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:27.999
Dad, he's sincere.

00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:30.999
- Good.
- Come on, let's eat.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:35.541
Mom! Mom!

00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:37.749
Come collect your money tomorrow.

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:42.124
Dad, are you alright?

00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:43.832
Give me some water.

00:21:43.832 --> 00:21:45.749
Fine.

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:47.291
Thanks.

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:50.332
Better?

00:21:50.332 --> 00:21:51.707
Better.

00:22:27.582 --> 00:22:28.541
Dad!

00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:30.624
Dad!

00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:33.499
- Hay!
- What?

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:34.291
Come here...

00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:36.041
- What?
- Come.

00:22:36.874 --> 00:22:37.916
What is the matter?

00:22:37.916 --> 00:22:39.916
Don't jump yet.

00:22:40.332 --> 00:22:43.082
Is he my younger brother?

00:22:43.082 --> 00:22:47.916
Of course he is.

00:22:47.957 --> 00:22:52.541
But it's the first time you see him,

00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:54.999
I feel strange.

00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:58.457
What so strange, Dad is not rich.

00:22:58.457 --> 00:23:01.416
If so he may be interested in our money.

00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:05.791
No proof! If...

00:23:05.874 --> 00:23:06.832
What?

00:23:06.832 --> 00:23:10.166
The old way to test blood.

00:23:10.749 --> 00:23:11.874
Blood testing?

00:23:12.082 --> 00:23:15.041
Not, it will hurt him.

00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:17.374
You don't have to tell him.

00:23:17.374 --> 00:23:19.582
We cut his finger accidentally.

00:23:19.582 --> 00:23:21.041
And mix your blood with his

00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:22.791
If they mix, then it proves.

00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:29.999
What is the identity.

00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:33.832
Dad, give a hand.

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:37.166
My son!

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.082
What?

00:23:38.082 --> 00:23:42.249
Your eyebrow has gold colour.

00:23:42.249 --> 00:23:45.124
- Really?
- Yes, it mean longevity.

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:45.916
How does it mean?

00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:49.041
It means you have to get rid of the colour.

00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:49.749
Yeah.

00:23:49.749 --> 00:23:52.041
I'll help you, don't move.

00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:54.791
Coming.

00:23:54.791 --> 00:23:56.249
Crockroach!

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.916
- What's matter?
- Nothing.

00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:05.124
What's going on?

00:24:05.624 --> 00:24:09.041
Dad, why put a stick there?

00:24:09.124 --> 00:24:10.957
For decoration.

00:24:10.957 --> 00:24:12.541
- Yeah?
- Yes.

00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:13.957
Looks good.

00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:14.624
Looks very good.

00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:15.541
I do the same.

00:24:16.457 --> 00:24:17.791
Dad, are you alright?

00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:20.666
Brother, it's a good decoration.

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:21.874
You too.

00:24:21.874 --> 00:24:23.166
- Come.
- You first.

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.041
You first.

00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:24.832
Come on.

00:24:24.832 --> 00:24:25.582
Come.

00:24:25.582 --> 00:24:26.416
You first.

00:24:26.416 --> 00:24:27.832
No, you first.

00:24:27.832 --> 00:24:29.249
Make yourself at home.

00:24:29.249 --> 00:24:30.541
It hurts.

00:24:30.541 --> 00:24:32.332
Your nail is too long.

00:24:32.332 --> 00:24:33.874
- Cut it off.
- I'll help you.

00:24:33.874 --> 00:24:35.457
No.

00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:36.249
No.

00:24:36.249 --> 00:24:37.416
- Cut it.
- My God!

00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:39.082
My God!

00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:39.874
Done.

00:24:39.874 --> 00:24:41.582
Not mine.

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:42.916
Not mine.

00:24:42.916 --> 00:24:44.041
Not mine neither.

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:50.291
Mine, I just come in, why cut my finger?

00:24:50.624 --> 00:24:52.082
Any bandage?

00:24:52.166 --> 00:24:53.332
Who are you?

00:24:53.332 --> 00:24:55.499
My friend.

00:24:55.499 --> 00:24:56.416
You afraid of crockroach?

00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:57.207
Yes.

00:24:57.207 --> 00:24:58.416
- Do you know what I am scare off?
- What?

00:24:58.416 --> 00:25:00.707
Flies, here's one.

00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:05.499
- Dad
- Chop up the fly.

00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:10.499
Dad!...

00:25:16.499 --> 00:25:18.082
The fly is here.

00:25:21.624 --> 00:25:22.374
Over there.

00:25:22.374 --> 00:25:23.124
Got you.

00:25:23.124 --> 00:25:24.249
Let me.

00:25:29.749 --> 00:25:30.874
Dead.

00:25:30.916 --> 00:25:34.624
You are bleeding.

00:25:34.624 --> 00:25:35.332
- Yeah?
- Iwipe it off

00:25:35.332 --> 00:25:36.707
- No wonder it hurts.
-for you.

00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:38.707
Clean the towel.

00:25:41.082 --> 00:25:42.707
Can't cut this time.

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:43.957
You go pissing.

00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:53.999
They mix together.

00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:57.499
See, I was right.

00:25:57.499 --> 00:26:00.124
What ashame if he knows why we are doing.

00:26:00.124 --> 00:26:04.666
I am sorry, what can I do now?

00:26:04.666 --> 00:26:06.624
Be good to him.

00:26:07.707 --> 00:26:09.999
Chiu, find a job for my brother.

00:26:10.666 --> 00:26:13.374
I was prepared for the blood test.

00:26:13.374 --> 00:26:15.332
This pack is type O.

00:26:15.332 --> 00:26:17.832
Can mix with all types.

00:26:17.832 --> 00:26:19.291
Brother!

00:26:21.249 --> 00:26:22.374
Brother!

00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:26.374
- Coming.
- Are you alright?

00:26:26.374 --> 00:26:28.207
Fine, better with the bandage.

00:26:28.207 --> 00:26:29.374
Right.

00:26:29.374 --> 00:26:32.332
This is our Personnel Manager, Chiu.

00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:33.832
He has a job for you.

00:26:33.832 --> 00:26:35.166
Yes, come tomorrow.

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.082
Be a Manager?

00:26:36.082 --> 00:26:37.416
Go to hell!

00:26:38.749 --> 00:26:39.791
Good morning!

00:26:39.791 --> 00:26:43.249
It's passed 9 already, where's your brother?

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:45.624
He had to dress well.

00:26:51.957 --> 00:26:52.707
Brother!

00:26:52.707 --> 00:26:53.624
You look older.

00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:55.916
I know you admire me today.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:57.832
I can tell by your eyes.

00:26:58.082 --> 00:26:59.707
- Morning!
- Why stare at me, pal.

00:26:59.749 --> 00:27:02.499
Fatty, where's my seat?

00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:05.999
"Don't sit Jing's personal seat,
otherwise, your family will be killed."

00:27:28.416 --> 00:27:29.874
Go away!

00:27:32.124 --> 00:27:34.541
Auntie, some good news & some bad news.

00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:35.916
What do you want to know?

00:27:35.916 --> 00:27:36.874
Good news.

00:27:36.874 --> 00:27:38.416
A male spider on your desk.

00:27:38.416 --> 00:27:42.666
It's not good news.

00:27:42.666 --> 00:27:43.874
The male is not viperous.

00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:45.041
What's the bad news?

00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:47.124
The viperous female is under your arm.

00:27:49.457 --> 00:27:51.207
Nothing there.

00:27:52.207 --> 00:27:53.291
Let's go to the mid-night show tonight.

00:27:53.624 --> 00:27:56.332
Look, the girls behave like this.

00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:58.791
They are voluptuous.

00:27:58.832 --> 00:27:59.832
The Gamble Knight.

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.374
I wanna piss.

00:28:01.624 --> 00:28:03.999
Over there, the toilet.

00:28:04.624 --> 00:28:07.166
Brother said the longer spelling means for man.

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:08.624
Shorter spelling for woman.

00:28:08.624 --> 00:28:09.832
Yes.

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.166
I show you the way.

00:28:15.624 --> 00:28:17.457
You measure it yourself.

00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:27.291
It's longer this side.

00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:28.791
This side then.

00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:36.374
Do you know who's inside?

00:28:36.374 --> 00:28:37.874
Banana!

00:28:42.582 --> 00:28:44.541
What are you doing?

00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:45.666
To the toilet.

00:28:45.666 --> 00:28:48.874
This is the female toilet, I call the police.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:50.916
I am gay.

00:28:51.499 --> 00:28:53.666
So what? Still you can't
come in the female toilets.

00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:55.957
Get out!

00:28:56.749 --> 00:29:00.416
I go to the male & female toilets
ever since I was born.

00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:01.749
No one told me not to.

00:29:01.749 --> 00:29:04.374
Both toilets are all the same.

00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:09.291
No, the male toilets have basins.

00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:11.374
Don't lie, no basins in the male toilets.

00:29:11.374 --> 00:29:13.166
Damn you gay, don't try to be foolish.

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.957
Of course basins in the male toilets.

00:29:14.957 --> 00:29:16.832
What if no, you bastard.

00:29:16.832 --> 00:29:19.749
Come with me, come in.

00:29:21.249 --> 00:29:22.624
What are these?

00:29:22.624 --> 00:29:25.374
Right, block by block.

00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:29.457
- Why do you come in the male toilets?
- You bastard, fool me.

00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:31.749
He said he doesn't know
what are the basins.

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:34.624
I show you the urine basins.

00:29:34.624 --> 00:29:35.957
You tell him.

00:29:36.082 --> 00:29:37.374
I have to piss.

00:29:37.374 --> 00:29:38.999
What are you doing?

00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:41.249
Show us how to piss.

00:29:41.249 --> 00:29:42.999
I think she wants to have a glimpse.

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:44.291
You bastard.

00:29:47.666 --> 00:29:48.666
What's matter?

00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:50.249
Are you alright?

00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:51.541
Nothing.

00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:55.749
Good morning!

00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:57.582
You have finished?

00:29:57.582 --> 00:29:59.832
Very comfortable. Are you alright?

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:00.541
I had been kicked.

00:30:00.541 --> 00:30:01.541
At where?

00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:02.582
Why should I tell you?

00:30:02.582 --> 00:30:04.624
Right here?

00:30:04.624 --> 00:30:06.749
- How do you know?
- Just a guess.

00:30:23.124 --> 00:30:24.457
"Shark" is in the toilet.

00:30:24.457 --> 00:30:25.832
I ask him to go in again.

00:30:25.832 --> 00:30:27.249
- I don't believe.
- I don't believe.

00:30:27.499 --> 00:30:30.416
Let's bet. 2:1 if he stays for 15 seconds.

00:30:30.416 --> 00:30:33.957
1:1 if 30 seconds, 1:2 if up to 45 seconds.

00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:35.457
1:4 if he can stay for a minute.

00:30:35.457 --> 00:30:36.499
1477

00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:40.916
If he comes out unharmed, 1:100.

00:30:44.124 --> 00:30:45.082
What's up?

00:30:45.874 --> 00:30:49.707
I have no tissue for my cold,
get some from the toilet you went.

00:30:50.457 --> 00:30:52.707
It's a female toilet that I went.

00:30:52.707 --> 00:30:55.166
I know. But it's the only place to have tissue.

00:30:55.166 --> 00:30:58.416
Where else can I get tissue, go get it for me.

00:30:58.499 --> 00:30:59.499
Really?

00:30:59.499 --> 00:31:01.457
Your brother told you to listen to me.

00:31:01.457 --> 00:31:02.541
Go, quick.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:04.249
No problem.

00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:08.457
Hay, what do you want to bet?

00:31:11.791 --> 00:31:13.999
- I bet on...
- Hay, what are you doing?

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:16.249
Hay...

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:17.832
Bet on how long your son
can stay in the female toilet.

00:31:17.832 --> 00:31:20.541
You make fun with my son.

00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:23.124
Shut up! Bet or no bet?

00:31:23.124 --> 00:31:25.166
- Place your stake...
- But be quick.

00:31:25.166 --> 00:31:25.874
Shut up!

00:31:25.874 --> 00:31:30.041
Bet on my son will be fine, $10.

00:31:31.749 --> 00:31:33.207
What are you doing?

00:31:33.332 --> 00:31:34.499
To the toilet.

00:31:34.499 --> 00:31:36.041
Do you know it's the female toilet?

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:37.874
I'll call the police.

00:31:38.749 --> 00:31:40.457
I am gay.

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.624
Do you know more than one hundred

00:31:43.624 --> 00:31:47.832
sex maniaces are beaten to death
in the female toilets by me.

00:31:55.207 --> 00:31:58.166
No more jokes, get up.

00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:15.874
My God, dead already.

00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:27.624
No impulses, my goodness!

00:32:27.624 --> 00:32:31.166
You crashed your head with the wall.

00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:33.082
I will pray for you.

00:32:33.082 --> 00:32:36.332
Don't come back to get me.

00:32:38.499 --> 00:32:41.874
No, I have to keep calm.

00:32:41.874 --> 00:32:43.957
No one can know that I have killed.

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:48.499
What are you doing?

00:32:49.541 --> 00:32:50.832
Did you see someone inside?

00:32:50.832 --> 00:32:53.916
No, I saw no one.

00:32:53.916 --> 00:32:55.916
Hay, nobody?

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:00.916
Did you see anyone?

00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:02.249
No. Toilet paper.

00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:04.957
Nothing happened?

00:33:04.957 --> 00:33:08.291
It was smooth, but no toilet paper.

00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:09.291
This one...

00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:12.124
I took it up from the dunny & dried it.

00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.416
Thanks.

00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:19.249
Pay for the bet.

00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:21.082
- How much?
- You have a look yourself.

00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:23.416
It's $1,0007

00:33:23.416 --> 00:33:24.582
Yes, it's $1,000 from the beginning.

00:33:24.582 --> 00:33:26.166
I take the money first.

00:33:26.166 --> 00:33:28.207
- Don't fool me.
- Not enough.

00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:30.166
- Down there.
- Don't search...

00:33:35.124 --> 00:33:36.082
Kit!

00:33:36.707 --> 00:33:38.666
Watch out.

00:33:39.082 --> 00:33:41.082
Him again, damn!

00:33:41.082 --> 00:33:44.874
You have fooled me already.

00:33:48.416 --> 00:33:49.624
Take a seat.

00:33:53.624 --> 00:33:55.082
Let me introduce.

00:33:58.082 --> 00:33:59.957
My brother Chi Man Ching.

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:02.999
Office boy, first day.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.332
Office boy!

00:34:04.332 --> 00:34:05.416
We are colleagues.

00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:08.291
I am Lucy, my friend Banana Fung!

00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:11.124
Something smells.

00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:20.999
Kit, I found a shirt suitable for you.

00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:22.541
Let's go to have a look.

00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:23.457
Good.

00:34:24.374 --> 00:34:27.457
- We'll be back.
- Lucy!

00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:47.416
What's your book?

00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:48.457
Kung Fu!

00:34:49.124 --> 00:34:51.416
A Kung Fu called AIDS?

00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:55.082
Quiet, I don't have AIDS.

00:34:55.082 --> 00:34:56.374
Mind your words.

00:34:56.374 --> 00:34:57.499
Don't worry.

00:34:57.499 --> 00:34:58.832
I am fine.

00:34:58.832 --> 00:35:04.082
I don't have AIDS.

00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:09.707
I really don't have.

00:35:12.749 --> 00:35:15.541
Why are you crying?

00:35:15.541 --> 00:35:17.707
Don't tell anybody please.

00:35:17.707 --> 00:35:19.457
I won't.

00:35:21.707 --> 00:35:23.624
I am gay, you know it.

00:35:24.832 --> 00:35:27.874
And China No. 1001.

00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:29.749
What 10017

00:35:29.749 --> 00:35:33.707
The No. 1001 AIDS patient.

00:35:37.249 --> 00:35:38.624
I tell you a secret.

00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:42.374
I turned to be a gay because of AIDS.

00:35:43.124 --> 00:35:45.124
It will get to people easily.

00:35:45.124 --> 00:35:46.957
Even by air.

00:35:46.957 --> 00:35:48.707
I got it from a stool.

00:35:48.707 --> 00:35:49.457
A stool?

00:35:49.457 --> 00:35:52.041
From an AIDS patient's stool.

00:35:52.374 --> 00:35:53.791
Are you alright?

00:35:53.791 --> 00:35:55.749
A cramped leg.

00:35:55.749 --> 00:35:57.249
- Sit.
- You sit.

00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:02.207
Have some water.

00:36:02.374 --> 00:36:03.999
You are using my glass.

00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:10.166
I beat you.

00:36:10.499 --> 00:36:12.124
Why?

00:36:12.124 --> 00:36:13.541
You are biased.

00:36:13.999 --> 00:36:16.082
No, I'm not.

00:36:16.082 --> 00:36:17.957
Look into my eyes.

00:36:17.957 --> 00:36:19.457
Your voice biases me.

00:36:20.874 --> 00:36:22.749
My voice is gentle.

00:36:22.749 --> 00:36:24.291
You splash water.

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:27.874
I was careless, I wipe it dry for you.

00:36:28.832 --> 00:36:29.874
Thanks.

00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:31.374
- You know,
- That's alright.

00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:33.457
You are among the girls.

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:36.416
The best I've ever seen.

00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:37.749
When do we leave?

00:36:37.749 --> 00:36:38.749
Thanks.

00:36:42.957 --> 00:36:47.124
Oh...Mom!

00:36:47.582 --> 00:36:48.624
What are you looking at?

00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:53.832
Sorry Miss, I wipe it up for you.

00:36:53.832 --> 00:36:55.457
- What's matter?
- What had happened?

00:36:55.457 --> 00:36:58.291
He has got AIDS.

00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:00.291
Where did you hear it?

00:37:00.291 --> 00:37:03.666
Are you iliterated?

00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:06.666
He's No. 1001 AIDS patient.

00:37:07.249 --> 00:37:08.332
Who told you?

00:37:08.332 --> 00:37:09.582
He said so.

00:37:09.582 --> 00:37:12.207
If I were, I wouldn't have told you.

00:37:12.207 --> 00:37:14.332
He has got an AIDS book.

00:37:14.749 --> 00:37:16.666
Yeah? Show me!

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:18.082
Do you mean it?

00:37:18.416 --> 00:37:20.374
What you can't show?

00:37:20.374 --> 00:37:21.749
Fine, take it.

00:37:25.332 --> 00:37:26.624
You are too sensitive.

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:28.707
He kissed me too.

00:37:29.874 --> 00:37:31.457
I'll rather have a banana.

00:37:31.457 --> 00:37:34.291
Don't think that you are really a banana.

00:37:34.582 --> 00:37:37.124
Clean up yourself.

00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:37.999
Come.

00:37:38.124 --> 00:37:39.249
I have to talk to you.

00:37:39.249 --> 00:37:40.374
No.

00:37:40.832 --> 00:37:41.874
Up to you.

00:37:42.041 --> 00:37:43.166
What do you want to say?

00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:46.207
She broke the taps in the female's toilets.

00:37:46.207 --> 00:37:48.457
It looks like a pool.

00:37:50.624 --> 00:37:52.207
Do you need saving device?

00:38:01.874 --> 00:38:03.874
Who's coming?

00:38:04.082 --> 00:38:07.041
Dad.

00:38:08.207 --> 00:38:09.166
Damn!

00:38:11.124 --> 00:38:14.124
My Dad is a bull, my Mom a stove.

00:38:14.124 --> 00:38:18.499
Mind you, I'll fix you up.

00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:20.082
Damn!

00:38:20.457 --> 00:38:23.582
I am your Dad & you have plenty of Moms.

00:38:23.582 --> 00:38:28.999
I admit that.

00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:34.249
Not safe at home.

00:38:34.249 --> 00:38:35.541
I was nearly killed.

00:38:35.541 --> 00:38:38.249
I am so happy now.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.666
And brother get change

00:38:39.666 --> 00:38:42.457
& let's put on a show on bed.

00:38:42.457 --> 00:38:43.582
Wait.

00:38:43.582 --> 00:38:46.832
You didn't behave in the restaurant.

00:38:46.832 --> 00:38:48.332
Lucy's friend was upset.

00:38:48.332 --> 00:38:50.041
Said you had bad manner.

00:38:50.041 --> 00:38:54.374
Listen to me & have good relationship.

00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:58.332
Really?

00:38:58.332 --> 00:38:58.957
Of course.

00:38:58.957 --> 00:38:59.749
Really?

00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:00.707
Really.

00:39:00.707 --> 00:39:06.624
Tell me what to do.

00:39:06.749 --> 00:39:08.041
Good.

00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:10.791
Buy a birthday gift for her tomorrow.

00:39:10.791 --> 00:39:14.916
And let her punish you as she wishes.

00:39:14.916 --> 00:39:18.249
I can't take it.

00:39:18.249 --> 00:39:21.374
My God! You...

00:39:21.624 --> 00:39:26.749
For you future "Sister-in-law", just do it.

00:39:26.749 --> 00:39:27.749
No! No! No!

00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:30.374
Damn! Go! Go! Go!

00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:41.999
I am dizzy!

00:39:47.082 --> 00:39:48.374
Wait.

00:39:48.624 --> 00:39:51.291
I have a football game, I go after that.

00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:55.249
He speaks funny.

00:39:55.249 --> 00:39:57.207
Nothing like me.

00:39:57.207 --> 00:39:59.207
The voice does not match.

00:39:59.207 --> 00:40:03.124
Not sure if he's insane or mad.

00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:12.957
Why pick the food?

00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.166
I didn't.

00:40:23.957 --> 00:40:25.874
The dress costs me $109,700

00:40:25.874 --> 00:40:26.916
If anyone says it's not pretty.

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:29.374
I'll squeeze his neck.

00:40:29.874 --> 00:40:31.707
You want to hear the truth?

00:40:32.249 --> 00:40:33.332
The truth.

00:40:33.957 --> 00:40:34.791
Not bad.

00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:36.332
- What about the lie?
- Very pretty.

00:40:36.332 --> 00:40:39.082
Very good, no wonder my friend likes you.

00:40:39.082 --> 00:40:42.416
So many roses, they are pretty.

00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:45.749
128 roses.

00:40:45.749 --> 00:40:47.707
My boy friend Julian bought for me.

00:40:47.707 --> 00:40:50.791
He's funny & care about me.

00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:53.916
He remembers your birthday
even though he's in New York.

00:40:53.916 --> 00:40:57.166
He surprised me by coming back last year.

00:40:57.457 --> 00:40:59.541
Must be Julian.

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.666
I give it to you later if you like.

00:41:06.707 --> 00:41:08.666
Hi! Happy Birthday!

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:09.749
You?

00:41:10.957 --> 00:41:12.624
Ching, what's matter?

00:41:13.582 --> 00:41:14.749
Did you ask him to come?

00:41:14.749 --> 00:41:16.041
I ask him to apologize.

00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:17.666
I have to settle with him.

00:41:18.249 --> 00:41:19.666
Come.

00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:22.999
What did you do?

00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:25.124
I had finished my ball game

00:41:25.124 --> 00:41:27.416
and fell into the water on the way.

00:41:27.416 --> 00:41:28.832
Congratulations!

00:41:28.832 --> 00:41:30.957
Change your clothes.

00:41:30.957 --> 00:41:33.041
Fine, I have to change.

00:41:35.124 --> 00:41:36.999
He is sincare.

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:40.832
Hay, Julian?

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:42.791
Yes! Happy Birthday!

00:41:42.791 --> 00:41:43.957
Thanks.

00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:47.374
So late. Are you in Hong Kong?

00:41:47.374 --> 00:41:48.666
I am in New York.

00:41:50.582 --> 00:41:52.207
The white roses are nice.

00:41:52.416 --> 00:41:53.624
What white roses?

00:41:55.749 --> 00:41:57.541
I wanna talk to you.

00:41:57.666 --> 00:41:59.082
What?

00:41:59.082 --> 00:42:01.374
We have been apart for so long.

00:42:01.374 --> 00:42:03.582
I have another girl friend.

00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:07.749
You...

00:42:07.749 --> 00:42:11.166
Keep calm. I wanna break up with you.

00:42:12.207 --> 00:42:14.707
Good idea.

00:42:15.249 --> 00:42:20.499
Julian, I really like you, I promise.

00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:21.666
Are you alright?

00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.416
I am happy.

00:42:25.374 --> 00:42:26.874
What are you doing?

00:42:27.332 --> 00:42:28.541
Come back soon.

00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:31.832
No, I'll get married next month.

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:33.707
What if you come to New York.

00:42:34.707 --> 00:42:35.749
Perfect!

00:42:35.749 --> 00:42:38.249
You really come?

00:42:38.791 --> 00:42:43.916
Someone said New York would have an earthquake.

00:42:43.916 --> 00:42:48.166
Watch out for the cars.

00:42:49.207 --> 00:42:50.374
Bye!

00:42:54.749 --> 00:42:57.624
Let me put on my make-up.

00:42:58.457 --> 00:43:00.874
- Hay!
- Very happy...

00:43:00.874 --> 00:43:02.916
New York would have an earthquake?

00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:07.749
Don't worry about the men.

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:12.041
I don't care if you don't like me smoke.

00:43:14.082 --> 00:43:18.707
I take two, nobody cares about me.

00:43:28.332 --> 00:43:29.499
What are you doing?

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:34.707
I tried my best not to
disturb you from talking.

00:43:34.707 --> 00:43:36.041
Are you alright?

00:43:45.416 --> 00:43:46.624
Banana, what's matter?

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:47.541
What's matter?

00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:50.041
Brother!

00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:51.416
- You touched her?
- Not yet.

00:43:51.416 --> 00:43:52.791
- She touched you?
- Not yet.

00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:54.791
That's good then.

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:57.207
What are you talking about?

00:43:57.541 --> 00:43:59.082
Banana, what's going on?

00:43:59.082 --> 00:44:00.791
Lucy,

00:44:03.624 --> 00:44:05.582
Julian breaks up with me.

00:44:05.624 --> 00:44:07.499
Did they deliver my flowers?

00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:08.666
You bought me the roses?

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.082
Yes, today is Jan, 28.

00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.666
So 128 roses.

00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:13.374
I spent all my money

00:44:13.374 --> 00:44:14.707
and had to walk back.

00:44:14.707 --> 00:44:16.249
And fell into the water.

00:44:16.582 --> 00:44:17.749
Thanks.

00:44:18.582 --> 00:44:19.916
And sorry!

00:44:22.332 --> 00:44:23.582
Don't cry!

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:26.916
O.K.

00:44:26.916 --> 00:44:27.832
Sorry!

00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:31.791
Banana, Julian is stupid to break up with you.

00:44:31.874 --> 00:44:34.541
Let's go to the disco after dinner.

00:44:34.541 --> 00:44:35.416
Good idea.

00:44:35.874 --> 00:44:38.749
Your shirt looks terrible.

00:44:38.749 --> 00:44:41.166
This looks a lot better.

00:44:42.666 --> 00:44:45.916
The shirt is sticky.

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.041
- Really?
- Sticky?

00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:48.249
You must sweat a lot,

00:44:48.249 --> 00:44:50.082
- What sticky?
-It should be O.K.

00:44:50.082 --> 00:44:53.041
No, I feel not better, do you know it?

00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:54.082
What you like to drink?

00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:55.124
A sparkling.

00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:57.291
No, champagne, I pay for it.

00:44:57.291 --> 00:44:58.999
No, I pay for it, one champagne.

00:44:58.999 --> 00:44:59.624
Good.

00:44:59.624 --> 00:45:01.124
I called my Dad,

00:45:01.124 --> 00:45:02.249
he'll pay for it.

00:45:02.249 --> 00:45:03.457
Lucy, let's have a dance.

00:45:03.457 --> 00:45:05.166
<i>-0 XK.
- Let's go!</i>

00:45:10.832 --> 00:45:12.457
Let's dance too.

00:45:12.499 --> 00:45:13.999
It's better chat here.

00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:15.499
I feel bored, accompany with me.

00:45:15.499 --> 00:45:17.416
0O.K., if you insist.

00:45:22.041 --> 00:45:26.666
"Where do the camel travellers come from"

00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:27.457
"Where do the camel..."

00:45:27.457 --> 00:45:30.624
You dance well, let's go back.

00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:31.916
But I feel like dancing.

00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:34.124
No, I like to chat.

00:45:34.124 --> 00:45:35.249
Fine, let's go back.

00:45:37.541 --> 00:45:40.999
To dance well takes time.

00:45:41.249 --> 00:45:43.082
I have been dancing for a long time.

00:45:43.082 --> 00:45:46.124
A lot of practice and endurance.

00:45:46.124 --> 00:45:47.999
And I have the result like now.

00:45:47.999 --> 00:45:49.666
You noticed it.

00:45:49.707 --> 00:45:50.874
Yes.

00:45:52.791 --> 00:45:55.541
Smile, enjoy yourself.

00:46:00.707 --> 00:46:02.541
The bald head looks good.

00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:07.916
He looks ugly and cruel.

00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:10.499
No, I knock his head for 3 times.

00:46:10.499 --> 00:46:11.999
And he'll not fight back.

00:46:13.416 --> 00:46:16.166
Don't try it. He's not kind.

00:46:16.166 --> 00:46:18.249
Will you smile if I succeed?

00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:19.874
Don't.

00:46:20.332 --> 00:46:21.291
Watch it.

00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:22.291
Hay!

00:46:31.291 --> 00:46:31.957
Why did you hit me?

00:46:31.957 --> 00:46:33.707
Bald Wong, I found you at last.

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:35.124
I am not Bald Wong.

00:46:35.124 --> 00:46:36.207
You are not?

00:46:36.207 --> 00:46:38.916
You look as handsome as my friend.

00:46:38.916 --> 00:46:39.999
I am sorry to have mistaken you.

00:46:39.999 --> 00:46:41.374
I am sorry.

00:46:41.374 --> 00:46:42.332
I am trouble sorry.

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:43.166
Look carefully next time.

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:46.291
I will, sorry.

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:53.666
Bald Wong!

00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:55.499
I saw one looked exactly like you,

00:46:55.499 --> 00:46:56.541
and I knocked on his head,

00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:59.916
he said he's not you.

00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:00.874
How embarrassing.

00:47:00.874 --> 00:47:02.832
That's me.

00:47:03.249 --> 00:47:06.124
Don't fool me, you can't be so quick.

00:47:07.041 --> 00:47:08.749
I am telling you, I am not Bald Wong.

00:47:08.749 --> 00:47:11.374
We don't know you.

00:47:11.374 --> 00:47:13.166
- He's my boy friend.
- Did you hear?

00:47:13.166 --> 00:47:15.624
I am sorry, pal.

00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:16.999
Look carefully at me.

00:47:16.999 --> 00:47:18.374
I will.

00:47:18.374 --> 00:47:20.416
You are not Bald Wong, I can tell.

00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:21.541
- Remember it.
- I am sorry,

00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.499
my fault.

00:47:22.499 --> 00:47:23.624
He must be insane.

00:47:32.207 --> 00:47:35.499
Bald Wong, you date my wife, go to hell.

00:47:35.499 --> 00:47:37.582
Hay, he's not Bald Wong.

00:47:37.582 --> 00:47:39.916
He's Bald Wong, he seduces my wife.

00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:40.957
- Don't draw your knife.
- I have to.

00:47:40.957 --> 00:47:42.499
- Don't draw your knife.
- No chance to talk.

00:47:42.499 --> 00:47:44.416
Look carefully if I am Bald Wong.

00:47:46.707 --> 00:47:49.999
Listen carefully on the sound.

00:47:49.999 --> 00:47:52.291
His head and Wong's head sound differently.

00:47:52.291 --> 00:47:53.457
Not clear.

00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.041
Did you hear?

00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.207
Yes.

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.499
Don't wear the helmet if you are not Bald Wong.

00:47:59.499 --> 00:48:01.832
You are wrong...go.

00:48:02.332 --> 00:48:03.541
Who's she?

00:48:03.541 --> 00:48:05.416
My Auntie, she is insane.

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:07.499
She wears the beard.

00:48:07.582 --> 00:48:08.541
Thanks.

00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:10.707
Fine, I said not to recognize you as Bald Wong.

00:48:10.707 --> 00:48:11.457
Thanks.

00:48:11.457 --> 00:48:12.707
-0.K., no problem.
- Thanks.

00:48:15.166 --> 00:48:16.374
Hit four times just then.

00:48:16.374 --> 00:48:17.707
You are not considerate.

00:48:17.707 --> 00:48:19.332
My Dad didn't behave.

00:48:19.332 --> 00:48:21.916
He's insane, afraid of newspapers.

00:48:23.249 --> 00:48:25.291
You mean I am insane?

00:48:25.291 --> 00:48:27.874
You look really mentally.

00:48:27.999 --> 00:48:29.416
I have no supporter.

00:48:30.082 --> 00:48:33.249
Right, we have 3 men & 2 girls, so what?

00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:37.207
You have a bigger group to insult me.

00:48:39.957 --> 00:48:41.749
Why do you say so?

00:48:41.749 --> 00:48:43.124
I don't know them, I am only sharing the table.

00:48:43.124 --> 00:48:44.541
Right, we share the table only.

00:48:44.541 --> 00:48:45.541
Hay!

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:49.207
Mind the minority.

00:48:49.207 --> 00:48:50.332
Beat him.

00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:03.541
- Kit, are you alright?
- Brother!

00:49:03.541 --> 00:49:05.874
Are you O.K. ?

00:49:05.874 --> 00:49:06.707
It hurts.

00:49:06.707 --> 00:49:08.749
Dad had beaten them.

00:49:10.374 --> 00:49:12.082
Let's talk another day.

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:12.832
Call me if can't find him.

00:49:12.832 --> 00:49:13.874
O.K.

00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:21.207
This way.

00:49:27.499 --> 00:49:30.124
Stop, you too.

00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:36.166
My God, fight like this.

00:49:36.166 --> 00:49:37.374
Unbelievable.

00:49:37.749 --> 00:49:39.957
What you see? Didn't see it?

00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:43.874
Dad, why are you on your knees?

00:49:43.874 --> 00:49:45.249
I got beaten.

00:49:45.249 --> 00:49:47.291
Who did it, tell me.

00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:48.874
I don't recognize him.

00:49:48.874 --> 00:49:51.541
You have a rest.

00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:54.499
I have to boil the soup at home.

00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:57.416
So many people.

00:50:00.291 --> 00:50:01.916
I am sorry, pal.

00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:03.541
- Bastard!
- I am wrong.

00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:04.874
- What do you want to do?
- I was fooling around,

00:50:04.874 --> 00:50:06.207
I am innocent.

00:50:06.207 --> 00:50:08.082
I won't do it again.

00:50:08.082 --> 00:50:09.916
You bastard, don't cry.

00:50:10.666 --> 00:50:13.499
I am bastard, I have thought it over.

00:50:13.499 --> 00:50:15.832
I have decide...to hit you once more.

00:50:15.832 --> 00:50:16.666
Beat him.

00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:20.166
Go.

00:50:29.874 --> 00:50:30.916
Get out.

00:50:32.457 --> 00:50:34.916
- Daddy!
- Lucy, are you alright?

00:50:34.916 --> 00:50:35.791
I am fine.

00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:38.416
When Kit comes out.

00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:40.666
Say you bail us.

00:50:40.666 --> 00:50:41.999
They still don't know ll...

00:50:41.999 --> 00:50:44.291
O.K...why end up like this?

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.416
I told you the three of them were bad.

00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:49.624
Uncle Chi and Kit are of triad.

00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:50.624
Mind your words.

00:50:50.624 --> 00:50:52.374
He is not wrong.

00:50:52.374 --> 00:50:56.166
But defaming.

00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:04.624
I think the man from China did it.

00:51:04.832 --> 00:51:08.499
Kit is considerate.

00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.291
Brother!

00:51:12.999 --> 00:51:15.124
Boss, thanks for bailing me out.

00:51:15.124 --> 00:51:17.541
Fine, have a rest.

00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:26.749
Kit, you have tattooes?

00:51:26.749 --> 00:51:27.957
Be quiet!

00:51:27.957 --> 00:51:30.624
He shouldn't have it on his back.

00:51:31.249 --> 00:51:33.874
I should keep quiet, Lucy may have mistaken.

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:39.374
Uncle Chi is very mature.

00:51:39.374 --> 00:51:42.374
He will teach the two of them.

00:51:42.374 --> 00:51:43.874
Boss!

00:51:46.082 --> 00:51:47.082
Who are you?

00:51:47.082 --> 00:51:49.124
I am Yan Chi, boss!

00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:51.999
What did you do to yourself?

00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:52.749
I don't know.

00:51:52.749 --> 00:51:55.582
A group of men painted on my face.

00:51:55.582 --> 00:51:56.957
I don't know what's on here.

00:51:56.999 --> 00:51:58.541
You can't see?

00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:01.624
I have to close my eyes.

00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:03.999
Good lad.

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:07.791
Boss, excuse me.

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.166
Forget it.

00:52:10.249 --> 00:52:13.749
You are the most potential in the office.

00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:15.791
Take care of yourself.

00:52:15.874 --> 00:52:18.874
Be good from now on.

00:52:19.166 --> 00:52:22.582
I will ask my friends in China to come down.

00:52:22.582 --> 00:52:23.707
We have guns.

00:52:24.332 --> 00:52:25.332
You know.

00:52:26.082 --> 00:52:28.707
Boss, something wrong with him.

00:52:28.707 --> 00:52:31.582
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:33.166
That's fine.

00:52:42.624 --> 00:52:43.541
Brother!

00:52:44.166 --> 00:52:45.374
Where did you go?

00:52:45.749 --> 00:52:48.666
A cat chased after a dog at the cinema.

00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:50.624
So you watched for the whole night.

00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:53.832
They chased for the whole night.

00:52:57.124 --> 00:52:58.832
Look, no socks.

00:52:59.166 --> 00:53:00.624
That's not bad.

00:53:00.832 --> 00:53:02.041
Look at your hair, so long.

00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:03.666
Save the time from cutting.

00:53:04.541 --> 00:53:05.832
You walk like a cat.

00:53:05.832 --> 00:53:07.207
So that I won't fight.

00:53:08.582 --> 00:53:10.332
You talk like mad.

00:53:10.332 --> 00:53:11.791
Like my Dad.

00:53:15.749 --> 00:53:17.957
Jing, you have to change.

00:53:17.957 --> 00:53:20.041
You can never succeed.

00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:21.374
Put it back.

00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:23.416
Do I have to be like you?

00:53:24.291 --> 00:53:26.291
Your brother is of Manager rank.

00:53:26.291 --> 00:53:27.707
Well.

00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:29.832
I can do whatever brother can do.

00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:34.332
But brother may not be able to copy me.

00:53:34.332 --> 00:53:35.207
Really?

00:53:35.207 --> 00:53:37.041
Try once.

00:53:37.041 --> 00:53:37.791
O.K.

00:53:46.832 --> 00:53:47.791
O.K.

00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:55.957
Oh! No.

00:53:57.041 --> 00:54:00.374
Oh! No.

00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:34.541
Why your undies not torn off?

00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:36.332
I didn't tear it.

00:54:36.957 --> 00:54:40.082
I put the undies on my waist.

00:54:41.874 --> 00:54:43.124
You trapped me.

00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:46.291
We try again, this one doesn't count.

00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:48.666
You change our places.

00:54:48.666 --> 00:54:49.832
See who is the best stand in.

00:54:49.832 --> 00:54:52.291
The loser has to obey the winner.

00:54:52.291 --> 00:54:53.457
Deal.

00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:57.624
Where is Single-eye?

00:54:57.624 --> 00:55:00.124
Fine, I am Single-eye too.

00:55:00.291 --> 00:55:01.624
You are short-sighted.

00:55:01.624 --> 00:55:03.874
I always blink my eyes.

00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:04.791
Why?

00:55:05.082 --> 00:55:08.249
A man came to look for Single-eye.

00:55:08.249 --> 00:55:10.041
To buy Single-eye's stuff?

00:55:10.041 --> 00:55:11.416
How do you know?

00:55:12.499 --> 00:55:14.582
How voluptuous you look.

00:55:15.874 --> 00:55:17.749
You don't behave.

00:55:18.124 --> 00:55:20.166
- Good work.
- So do you.

00:55:20.166 --> 00:55:23.832
I'll tell you the truth.

00:55:24.582 --> 00:55:29.791
I come to buy the dose of voluptuary.

00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:34.332
"Never can cure voluptuary".

00:55:34.332 --> 00:55:35.874
I know.

00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:36.749
Be quick then.

00:55:36.749 --> 00:55:39.957
We don't have.

00:55:39.957 --> 00:55:41.374
Why did you blink?

00:55:41.374 --> 00:55:43.707
I know I was wrong.

00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:45.499
Never mind.

00:55:46.124 --> 00:55:47.916
But I won't do it again.

00:55:47.916 --> 00:55:49.791
What about this?

00:55:50.124 --> 00:55:52.082
Not bad.

00:55:53.707 --> 00:55:57.541
"Never can cure voluptuary".

00:55:57.541 --> 00:55:58.416
O.K.

00:55:59.124 --> 00:56:01.457
You have pastry in your throat.

00:56:01.457 --> 00:56:02.666
Really?

00:56:05.207 --> 00:56:05.999
What?

00:56:05.999 --> 00:56:08.582
See if it is genuine.

00:56:14.416 --> 00:56:16.082
Quite alright.

00:56:16.624 --> 00:56:18.416
Control yourself.

00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.082
No, I wanna kiss you.

00:56:20.082 --> 00:56:22.291
Kiss...

00:56:22.332 --> 00:56:24.957
Go to hell.

00:56:25.041 --> 00:56:27.999
Let me kiss you.

00:56:28.707 --> 00:56:30.916
Good, fine.

00:56:34.874 --> 00:56:36.082
"Super Itchy Powder"

00:56:43.582 --> 00:56:44.374
What?

00:56:44.374 --> 00:56:46.291
You are me today.

00:56:46.291 --> 00:56:47.541
So I give you my costume.

00:56:47.541 --> 00:56:49.457
Put them on.

00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:04.166
It's time to get itching.

00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:08.082
Where's your watch?

00:57:08.082 --> 00:57:09.499
No, what do you want?

00:57:09.666 --> 00:57:11.416
No watch to come to the movies.

00:57:12.957 --> 00:57:14.082
Times up!

00:57:20.207 --> 00:57:21.207
Itching?

00:57:21.207 --> 00:57:21.957
Yes.

00:57:21.957 --> 00:57:22.707
Scratch.

00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:25.166
No, not in the public.

00:57:25.207 --> 00:57:26.916
Go to a corner.

00:57:27.124 --> 00:57:29.916
Good idea, excuse me.

00:57:37.582 --> 00:57:38.874
I said no use.

00:57:38.874 --> 00:57:41.791
I said dinner only, but not to movies.

00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.124
No movies?

00:57:44.124 --> 00:57:46.249
Can I have a last wish?

00:57:46.707 --> 00:57:48.291
I buy the tickets.

00:58:03.666 --> 00:58:05.291
Brother, look over there.

00:58:10.082 --> 00:58:11.874
I find a mirror.

00:58:13.166 --> 00:58:14.999
I go to sell the mirror.

00:58:16.166 --> 00:58:17.499
Insane!

00:58:18.499 --> 00:58:19.457
Smart!

00:58:19.916 --> 00:58:23.624
A mad man there, what a place here.

00:58:23.749 --> 00:58:25.832
Let's go In.

00:58:26.582 --> 00:58:29.832
Not itching now, let's go.

00:58:29.832 --> 00:58:34.124
Slow, two nice ladies.

00:58:34.124 --> 00:58:36.707
Two more tickets & we go together.

00:58:36.707 --> 00:58:37.791
Don't, don't...

00:58:37.791 --> 00:58:41.291
I have got one already.

00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:43.666
You'll lose if you don't copy.

00:58:43.666 --> 00:58:44.541
Hay!

00:58:44.541 --> 00:58:47.041
- You think about it.
- Don't...

00:58:47.499 --> 00:58:49.041
Come.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:02.791
There again?

00:59:10.124 --> 00:59:10.749
Soft drink.

00:59:10.749 --> 00:59:11.582
Thanks.

00:59:11.957 --> 00:59:13.041
Hay!

00:59:13.916 --> 00:59:15.124
Behind.

00:59:18.332 --> 00:59:21.082
People are so open today.

00:59:21.207 --> 00:59:23.332
Keep quiet, concentrate.

00:59:57.874 --> 00:59:59.166
O.K.

00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:01.082
Man with man, look.

01:00:01.707 --> 01:00:03.332
Mind your own business.

01:00:21.749 --> 01:00:22.791
Damn it!

01:00:40.582 --> 01:00:41.832
No more patience.

01:00:42.457 --> 01:00:43.832
- You?
- Yes,

01:00:45.832 --> 01:00:47.707
I follow you.

01:00:47.707 --> 01:00:49.166
I know you come with him.

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:51.166
- Let me explain it.
- No need,

01:00:51.791 --> 01:00:54.332
love causes me to lose myself.

01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:57.166
Jealous makes me angry.

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:59.332
- But...
- I don't know what I am doing.

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.124
I only know that I love you.

01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:07.082
Hay!

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:10.874
Fix him.

01:01:10.999 --> 01:01:12.041
Shut up.

01:01:12.207 --> 01:01:14.541
You take my girl friend out.

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.291
What if I ask you to take care of my mom.

01:01:17.999 --> 01:01:21.374
You seduce your sister-in-law.

01:01:21.666 --> 01:01:23.874
- You are betrayer.
- No,

01:01:23.874 --> 01:01:25.291
don't get me wrong.

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:26.457
How dare you.

01:01:27.832 --> 01:01:30.541
Everybody, justice is always there.

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:33.041
I don't care anymore.

01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:34.457
Let's go.

01:01:36.082 --> 01:01:36.874
Wait.

01:01:36.874 --> 01:01:38.124
Don't go.

01:01:38.124 --> 01:01:40.166
Say something.

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:41.666
Explain.

01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:43.916
Listen to me.

01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:46.749
I introduced her to him.

01:01:46.749 --> 01:01:48.041
You are to be blamed.

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:50.999
But I didn't know he didn't behave.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:55.624
You bastard, get him.

01:01:57.124 --> 01:02:00.207
How dare you? Hit me like this?

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:04.416
I didn't try my best to hit.

01:02:04.624 --> 01:02:07.457
If they hit you,

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:09.249
you'll be beaten seriously.

01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:12.291
You failed to trap Chi Man Kit.

01:02:13.082 --> 01:02:15.041
The 3(8) Rule of Tricks.

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.957
Is to be quick when the other is prepared.

01:02:18.124 --> 01:02:20.249
It's Chi Man Kit this time.

01:02:20.332 --> 01:02:23.874
He's such an innocent person.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.207
I really can't hurt him.

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:27.541
Mind you that you have to be cold blooded.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.374
I have paid for you to fool him.

01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:31.957
Of course. I have to act like him tomorrow.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:34.957
I will really give him a lesson.

01:02:38.666 --> 01:02:43.332
Brother, I can really act like you today,

01:02:43.332 --> 01:02:44.957
I feel very happy.

01:02:44.957 --> 01:02:47.124
Good, that's good.

01:02:47.624 --> 01:02:49.707
Brother, I want...

01:02:49.707 --> 01:02:51.874
What do you want?

01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:58.166
"I have to try hard"

01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:03.541
"and make everybody happy"

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:09.124
"Young man has to work hard"

01:03:09.124 --> 01:03:14.207
"I have to be decisive"

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:19.207
"With my strength"

01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:23.582
"To cure my sadness & be happy"

01:03:23.582 --> 01:03:26.499
"Good friends, long last the friendship"

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:28.999
"Good friends will cheer up one another"

01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:31.666
"Good friends are dependable"

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:33.124
- Wait, ready?
- Ready!

01:03:33.124 --> 01:03:38.582
"Good friends are there to cheer me up"

01:03:43.332 --> 01:03:44.291
I am on top of you.

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:46.624
Insene.

01:03:46.624 --> 01:03:48.124
Don't watch then.

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:55.541
The contract with Mr. Kut Chun is important.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:57.874
I ask Mr. Ching to let you go as well.

01:03:57.874 --> 01:03:58.832
Yes.

01:04:00.124 --> 01:04:03.041
Mr. Ching, my brother has come.

01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:06.291
Is good to learn rather than fighting.

01:04:06.332 --> 01:04:10.749
Kit, ask him to mind his words.

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.832
The contract is fatal to us.

01:04:14.332 --> 01:04:15.541
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:17.499
Let me.

01:04:27.874 --> 01:04:29.624
Brother, have a drink.

01:04:29.874 --> 01:04:30.749
Good.

01:04:39.374 --> 01:04:42.249
Mr. Ching, Mr. Kut Chun has come.

01:04:42.249 --> 01:04:43.624
Ask them to come in.

01:04:44.457 --> 01:04:46.082
I feel sick.

01:04:48.082 --> 01:04:48.916
Me too.

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:49.624
What a coincidence.

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:50.666
Me too.

01:04:50.666 --> 01:04:53.041
Oh, the Japanese are coming.

01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:54.957
Delay the Japanese from coming in.

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:55.749
I have to go to the toilet.

01:04:55.749 --> 01:04:56.874
Me too.

01:04:59.082 --> 01:05:00.416
Be smart.

01:05:02.124 --> 01:05:03.166
Excuse me.

01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:10.332
Where is Mr. Ching?

01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:12.332
He told you to go down.

01:05:12.332 --> 01:05:14.999
To get Kut Chun's files here.

01:05:14.999 --> 01:05:15.999
O.K., thanks.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.166
Help yourselves.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:23.749
Be serious, sit down.

01:05:25.874 --> 01:05:26.957
Where are you going?

01:05:26.957 --> 01:05:30.041
Mr. Ching told me to get Kut Chun's files.

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.916
- He just went to toilet.
- Yeah?

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:34.541
He told me to meet Mr. Kut Chun.

01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:35.582
Who's here?

01:05:35.582 --> 01:05:36.957
Now, I wanna discuss the contract.

01:05:36.957 --> 01:05:39.832
You have the right to keep silent.

01:05:39.832 --> 01:05:41.291
But I won't listen to a single word you say.

01:05:41.749 --> 01:05:43.499
Do you know how much the contract costs?

01:05:43.499 --> 01:05:46.249
I know. $11.8 billion.

01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:47.124
You let me know?

01:05:47.124 --> 01:05:48.374
- Yes.
- Bring it here.

01:05:48.582 --> 01:05:50.082
- Now?
- No, what do we discuss?

01:05:50.082 --> 01:05:51.374
Yes.

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:52.916
Sorry, you are...

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:56.332
Women do not disturb men.

01:05:56.457 --> 01:05:57.916
I died in a hard way...

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.999
Freeze yourself for 8 hours.

01:06:02.999 --> 01:06:04.374
One movement for one punch.

01:06:07.874 --> 01:06:09.082
Where we just talking about?

01:06:09.249 --> 01:06:11.916
Learn to be as powerful.

01:06:11.916 --> 01:06:12.957
As the Hong Kong executives.

01:06:12.957 --> 01:06:14.791
Didn't know that reside Japanese men.

01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:16.874
Hong Kong men are mandom too.

01:06:16.874 --> 01:06:17.791
Good.

01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.291
That's nothing.

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:24.249
We wanna cut the contract to $11.1 billion.

01:06:24.249 --> 01:06:25.957
And we expect from you that

01:06:25.957 --> 01:06:28.707
beside the big business centre.

01:06:28.707 --> 01:06:30.707
You with to build under no conditions

01:06:30.707 --> 01:06:33.082
a staff welfare centre.

01:06:33.082 --> 01:06:35.041
Welfare centre? A whore house?

01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:36.957
Don't think that Chinese will

01:06:36.957 --> 01:06:38.166
insult women for money?

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:39.041
I mean...

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:41.332
You want us to find girls for you?

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:42.499
Go to hell.

01:06:46.624 --> 01:06:49.166
To punish your maniacity, $2 billion more.

01:06:49.374 --> 01:06:50.374
I am not a sex maniac.

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:51.916
Why so many Ill movies?

01:06:51.916 --> 01:06:53.416
I did not make them.

01:06:54.624 --> 01:06:56.082
But you watch them.

01:06:56.082 --> 01:06:56.749
But...

01:06:56.749 --> 01:06:58.082
$2 billion more.

01:06:58.082 --> 01:06:59.666
Why intruded China?

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:00.582
Not me, my grandpa.

01:07:00.582 --> 01:07:02.499
For you grandpa, $2 billion more.

01:07:06.832 --> 01:07:08.749
Nam King's massacre?

01:07:08.749 --> 01:07:10.082
I was not born.

01:07:10.082 --> 01:07:12.166
Born so late, $2 billion more.

01:07:13.082 --> 01:07:14.166
Mr. Kut Chun.

01:07:15.249 --> 01:07:17.624
Why you Japanese invade our place?

01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:18.916
I am not Japanese.

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.207
What are you?

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:21.457
My mom married a foreigner.

01:07:21.457 --> 01:07:22.499
You are mixed?

01:07:22.499 --> 01:07:24.249
Mix to discuss business?

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:26.041
$7 billion more.

01:07:29.707 --> 01:07:30.957
- Congratulations.
- How's it?

01:07:30.957 --> 01:07:32.166
The contract is done.

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:34.041
The Kut Chun Group agrees to give $150 billion

01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:35.249
to build a commercial centre.

01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:37.791
Two stories, doesn't matter
if not self-contained.

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:39.582
As long as it can stand up for 6 months.

01:07:39.582 --> 01:07:40.707
The contract is here.

01:07:41.332 --> 01:07:43.457
Mr. Kut Chun.

01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:48.082
Mr. Ching, help.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:50.666
What did you do?

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.499
I did it for the benefit of the firm.

01:07:52.499 --> 01:07:53.416
You told me so.

01:07:53.416 --> 01:07:54.416
I didn't ask you to fight.

01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:55.582
I didn't.

01:07:55.582 --> 01:07:56.541
Hay, did he hit you?

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.249
Yes!

01:07:57.249 --> 01:07:58.124
He beat you?

01:07:58.124 --> 01:08:00.832
Say it again, did I hit you?

01:08:00.832 --> 01:08:03.207
Let go of me.

01:08:04.332 --> 01:08:05.416
- Why did you hit him?
- Mr. Kut Chun!

01:08:05.416 --> 01:08:07.041
- Did you hear, he said no.
- Mr. Kut Chun!

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.291
Mr. Kut Chun!

01:08:09.291 --> 01:08:10.791
Arrest the mad man.

01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:12.416
Who is mad, I will arrest him.

01:08:13.082 --> 01:08:13.957
Mr. Ching, sorry.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:15.416
Sorry for what had happened.

01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:18.041
You two are fired.

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:19.916
Mind your words.

01:08:19.916 --> 01:08:21.916
I can't help, you all heard that.

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:23.332
What's matter?

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:24.999
What happened?

01:08:24.999 --> 01:08:27.207
They annoyed the customers,
your dad called the police.

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:28.624
Don't discuss here.

01:08:29.082 --> 01:08:32.541
Mr. Ching, I know I am responsible.

01:08:32.874 --> 01:08:36.332
We will resign if not fired.

01:08:36.624 --> 01:08:38.624
Sorry, let's go.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:41.124
As the guards to watch them packing up.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:42.457
Mr. Ching!

01:08:43.124 --> 01:08:46.999
Chi, no need to say, you are senior here.

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:49.541
I won't blame you on this.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:50.832
But, no need to say.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:53.874
I know my kids are wrong.

01:08:53.874 --> 01:08:55.249
But I have to say something.

01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:56.124
What?

01:08:56.124 --> 01:08:57.249
- I resign.
- What?

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:00.207
Dad, you have 2 more months to retire.

01:09:00.207 --> 01:09:02.124
You'll lose $200,000

01:09:02.124 --> 01:09:03.457
I didn't expect this to happen.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:07.207
Never mind, we are not short of $200,000-

01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:09.666
I can't stay after the two are gone.

01:09:09.666 --> 01:09:12.916
We try to spend less.

01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:15.166
The most important is happiness.

01:09:15.624 --> 01:09:16.832
Mr. Ching!

01:09:19.374 --> 01:09:20.374
Mr. Ching!

01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:24.291
It's done, let's go.

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:26.832
- Who's that?
- Dad!

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:30.416
Brother, dad!

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.707
Still awake?

01:09:31.999 --> 01:09:33.249
Sleep already.

01:09:35.624 --> 01:09:37.832
I am sorry for what had happened.

01:09:37.832 --> 01:09:40.416
I am so sorry.

01:09:40.999 --> 01:09:42.499
Have a rest.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:44.207
It's very late.

01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:47.291
Good-night!

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:53.999
My identity is revealed.

01:09:54.249 --> 01:09:56.832
What would you do if you were them?

01:09:57.124 --> 01:09:59.249
I will fix Jing Koo.

01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:01.457
Dangerous.

01:10:02.749 --> 01:10:05.749
Be well prepared.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.916
Freeze, pal.

01:10:29.374 --> 01:10:36.874
"Happy birthday to you."

01:10:36.874 --> 01:10:40.832
"Happy birthday to you."

01:10:40.832 --> 01:10:46.082
"Congratulations!"

01:10:46.332 --> 01:10:47.916
How do you know it's my birthday?

01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:50.624
I asked your mom about your birth proof.

01:10:50.624 --> 01:10:53.499
She only knows it's your birthday today.

01:10:56.874 --> 01:10:58.332
Why bite your lips?

01:10:58.332 --> 01:10:59.832
You are so good to me.

01:10:59.832 --> 01:11:01.791
Just like my real dad & brother.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.874
We are real your dad & brother.

01:11:04.874 --> 01:11:05.916
Yes.

01:11:06.207 --> 01:11:08.707
Come, make a wish.

01:11:08.707 --> 01:11:10.541
And have a little wine.

01:12:41.666 --> 01:12:46.624
You are very good people, if ever I am wrong.

01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:49.624
Hope that you'll be alright.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:52.666
And live forever.

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.749
And never meet another villain like me.

01:13:00.374 --> 01:13:01.041
Morning!

01:13:01.041 --> 01:13:02.624
- Morning!
- Anna, I have to call inside,

01:13:02.624 --> 01:13:04.207
-no phone calls for me.
- OK!

01:13:04.207 --> 01:13:05.124
I Know Mr. Kam.

01:13:09.124 --> 01:13:10.291
Banana, line 1.

01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:13.082
Thanks, can I use your phone?

01:13:17.457 --> 01:13:19.666
You succeeded to force Chi Man Kit to leave.

01:13:19.749 --> 01:13:21.457
You deserve the name Tricks Expert.

01:13:21.457 --> 01:13:24.166
Give me the money.

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.999
Sorry Banana, it should be line 2.

01:13:25.999 --> 01:13:26.707
Thanks.

01:13:26.707 --> 01:13:28.999
O.K., I'll send you a cheque.

01:13:28.999 --> 01:13:31.166
6B, Fat Tat Bldg., right?

01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:34.874
But I wanna teach him one more lesson.

01:13:34.874 --> 01:13:36.124
So he can never recover.

01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:38.207
No, I don't want to trap them any more.

01:13:38.207 --> 01:13:39.457
You ask someone else.

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.041
No regret.

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.749
I will never regret.

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:50.666
The voice sounds like Chi Man Jing.

01:13:55.457 --> 01:13:57.541
Is the Tricks Expert in?

01:13:58.791 --> 01:13:59.999
Who's that?

01:14:00.707 --> 01:14:01.957
Who are you?

01:14:02.582 --> 01:14:03.707
You?

01:14:04.041 --> 01:14:05.291
It's me.

01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:07.624
It's really you.

01:14:10.124 --> 01:14:14.291
Why help Macky to fool the Chi's?

01:14:14.291 --> 01:14:17.082
Tell me, go to hell.

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:18.207
Thanks.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:22.916
Have a drink first.

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.041
No.

01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:28.166
Try the free fight.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:30.416
Good, why do you do it?

01:14:32.416 --> 01:14:35.541
People pay me for doing it.

01:14:35.541 --> 01:14:37.291
I have to help.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:39.291
It's a pity, they treat you so well.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.582
They think that you are the younger son.

01:14:41.707 --> 01:14:45.124
You are beast.

01:14:46.999 --> 01:14:48.332
You can treat me like animal.

01:14:48.541 --> 01:14:50.624
I'll never touch them again.

01:14:50.999 --> 01:14:52.499
That's all I can do.

01:14:52.499 --> 01:14:54.291
Think how good they have been to you.

01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:56.207
They lost their job because of you.

01:14:56.707 --> 01:14:57.499
What do you intend to do?

01:14:57.499 --> 01:14:59.874
Deal with Macky and explain to them.

01:14:59.874 --> 01:15:00.582
Not possible.

01:15:00.582 --> 01:15:01.624
Why?

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:05.332
The 6(9) rule of tricks is.

01:15:05.332 --> 01:15:08.541
Have to be tough and no regret.

01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:10.374
How foolish?

01:15:10.374 --> 01:15:10.999
Me!

01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:12.832
You can change it.

01:15:12.832 --> 01:15:16.207
But I had sworn,

01:15:16.999 --> 01:15:20.624
If ever I break any of the rules,

01:15:21.207 --> 01:15:23.541
I would be severely punished.

01:15:24.249 --> 01:15:25.582
What punishment?

01:15:26.166 --> 01:15:28.332
I can never date girls anymore.

01:15:28.666 --> 01:15:30.124
You can date me.

01:15:30.124 --> 01:15:32.541
What? You?

01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:34.082
Yes, me.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.041
What if you regret?

01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:40.582
I swear if you can't date girls anymore,

01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:42.707
and I don't go with you, I can never
go out with the boys.

01:15:42.707 --> 01:15:44.082
Good.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:45.791
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:48.082
But one more condition.

01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:48.874
What condition?

01:15:48.874 --> 01:15:51.374
Can you have plastic surgery?

01:15:52.874 --> 01:15:54.166
Who's that?

01:15:55.082 --> 01:15:57.541
Keep calm.

01:15:58.041 --> 01:15:58.832
I am alright.

01:15:58.832 --> 01:16:00.207
Don't get excited.

01:16:00.291 --> 01:16:01.041
Right.

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:03.832
Do you have heart attack?

01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:05.124
No.

01:16:05.124 --> 01:16:06.999
Take 2 steps back.

01:16:07.499 --> 01:16:08.124
Yes.

01:16:08.374 --> 01:16:10.166
Further.

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.207
What are you doing?

01:16:12.207 --> 01:16:12.957
Quick.

01:16:12.957 --> 01:16:14.624
I am coming. Don't push me.

01:16:15.499 --> 01:16:19.541
Dad, kill me please.

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:21.999
I am so sorry.

01:16:23.749 --> 01:16:26.791
My son...you do not addict...

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.291
What?

01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:29.416
That kind?

01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:30.624
No, not that kind.

01:16:30.624 --> 01:16:32.624
Don't tell me you are of that kind.

01:16:32.624 --> 01:16:33.999
No, not that kind.

01:16:34.041 --> 01:16:36.499
Fine, what kind then?

01:16:36.499 --> 01:16:39.041
We are father & son, talk openly.

01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:41.749
I am not your son.

01:16:41.749 --> 01:16:42.416
What?

01:16:42.416 --> 01:16:45.749
I lied to you. I didn't tell you the truth.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:53.291
- Doesn't matter.
- You understand?

01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:54.832
I understand.

01:16:55.249 --> 01:16:57.332
I know you need dad's love.

01:16:57.332 --> 01:16:59.749
But dad won't blame you.

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:03.832
Dad loves both girls & boys, my daughter.

01:17:04.082 --> 01:17:07.416
I am not a girl, I don't mean this.

01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:08.707
What do you mean then?

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:11.207
I...look over there.

01:17:14.207 --> 01:17:15.249
Nothing.

01:17:15.582 --> 01:17:18.499
You...you look so handsome.

01:17:20.332 --> 01:17:23.999
My actual identity is the one
who improves social trend.

01:17:23.999 --> 01:17:26.666
Promote youth manner,
an incentive to the pictures.

01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:29.957
The great tricky Jing Koo.

01:17:29.957 --> 01:17:31.832
My English name is Jing Koo.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.291
You mean...

01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:34.916
I am not your son.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.707
My dad is Mean Koo & mom Ball Ng.

01:17:37.707 --> 01:17:40.166
Macky hires me to fool you & your son.

01:17:40.166 --> 01:17:42.624
To separate Lucy from you two.

01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:45.124
Dad.

01:17:45.582 --> 01:17:47.582
Dad...dad...

01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:50.166
Don't call...ll put on the show.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.332
Take a look over there.

01:17:53.999 --> 01:17:56.582
So fast this time, more time.

01:17:56.874 --> 01:17:57.666
O.K.

01:17:58.416 --> 01:17:59.416
0.K.?

01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:00.916
OK! Action!

01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:03.291
You understand now?

01:18:04.624 --> 01:18:07.791
Of course, I have been fooled.

01:18:08.207 --> 01:18:10.541
No problem. It won't Kill.

01:18:11.166 --> 01:18:12.666
You bastard, fool me.

01:18:12.666 --> 01:18:13.916
What, you fool me.

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:15.416
Dad.

01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:20.416
Why do you hit my boy friend?

01:18:21.666 --> 01:18:23.124
You hit my boy friend.

01:18:24.291 --> 01:18:24.957
Are you alright?

01:18:24.957 --> 01:18:25.916
I am fine.

01:18:25.916 --> 01:18:27.624
Jing Koo regrets.

01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:29.499
He didn't expect to be treated so good.

01:18:29.499 --> 01:18:31.332
He won't help Macky.

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:32.374
Really?

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:35.749
I really hope Kit will forgive me.

01:18:35.957 --> 01:18:38.207
I will help you to deal with Macky.

01:18:38.207 --> 01:18:42.332
But Kit's neck has put on the "magic oil".

01:18:42.332 --> 01:18:44.291
It is so stiff.

01:18:44.499 --> 01:18:46.624
He believes you are his younger brother.

01:18:46.624 --> 01:18:49.124
He'll lose control if you fool him.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.582
"Magic oil" for the neck?

01:18:50.582 --> 01:18:52.499
Of course. Where else?

01:18:52.499 --> 01:18:54.374
Think of a way.

01:19:00.832 --> 01:19:04.791
Dad, the thunder is coming.

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:13.666
What a world, I can't find my brother.

01:19:18.499 --> 01:19:20.374
Jing was here.

01:19:21.749 --> 01:19:22.916
He was here?

01:19:24.874 --> 01:19:27.207
He told dad a secret.

01:19:27.832 --> 01:19:29.291
What secret?

01:19:33.082 --> 01:19:34.874
This is the whole story.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:41.207
I was treated like a fool.

01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:44.916
No, there is always a reason.

01:19:44.916 --> 01:19:46.582
Forgive him.

01:19:48.374 --> 01:19:52.082
I won't forgive him.

01:19:59.082 --> 01:20:03.582
Kit, if he sincerely apologizes.

01:20:03.749 --> 01:20:05.957
Give him a chance.

01:20:06.207 --> 01:20:09.582
Fine, if he comes when I count 3

01:20:09.582 --> 01:20:10.832
I forgive him.

01:20:11.666 --> 01:20:14.332
1,2...

01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:18.249
You forgive me, how nice.

01:20:18.249 --> 01:20:19.957
- Thanks.
- Yes...

01:20:19.999 --> 01:20:22.166
Dad, you have been helping him.

01:20:22.166 --> 01:20:25.041
No. Dad thought...Kit.

01:20:25.041 --> 01:20:26.041
- Don't call me.
- Kit...Kit...

01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:28.291
Kit...he's sincere.

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:30.374
How can I tell if he's sincere.

01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:33.582
If I fool you again,
I'll get struck by thunder.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:37.957
You see.

01:20:37.957 --> 01:20:39.957
Kit, he's sincere.

01:20:39.999 --> 01:20:42.457
He's struck by thunder, don't help him.

01:20:42.582 --> 01:20:44.041
No, it was by mistake.

01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:45.416
Be careful.

01:20:45.499 --> 01:20:46.832
If I am going to fool you this time.

01:20:46.832 --> 01:20:49.541
I'll be struck to death by continue thunder.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:54.207
Oh!

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:56.291
Jing,

01:20:56.749 --> 01:20:58.666
Don't make such bad oaths.

01:20:58.666 --> 01:20:59.832
Strike you devil.

01:20:59.832 --> 01:21:01.124
Are you alright?

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:02.166
No reason.

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:04.082
Must have mistaken me.

01:21:04.082 --> 01:21:06.291
I shouldn't have been struck.

01:21:10.957 --> 01:21:13.207
How come struck at the door way.

01:21:13.207 --> 01:21:14.207
I have no time.

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:16.582
Hay!

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.791
See.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:19.874
Don't have to say.

01:21:20.374 --> 01:21:22.124
I forget about the past.

01:21:22.332 --> 01:21:24.624
From this moment, I don't want to see you.

01:21:24.624 --> 01:21:25.416
Leave, please leave.

01:21:25.416 --> 01:21:28.124
Kit, don't!

01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:32.457
Fine, he stays and I leave.

01:21:39.499 --> 01:21:41.666
I found someone I can trust.

01:21:43.082 --> 01:21:44.332
- Kit.
- Lucy,

01:21:44.749 --> 01:21:46.624
don't lean on the car.

01:21:46.874 --> 01:21:49.082
So boring, let's take a walk.

01:21:50.082 --> 01:21:52.416
Miss, you want umbrella?

01:21:53.124 --> 01:21:53.957
I...

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:55.499
Call you Miss?

01:21:56.916 --> 01:21:59.499
Kit, I have hidden something from you.

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:01.666
You lied to me too?

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:04.041
Fine, tell me.

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:06.166
I am Pluto Ching's daughter Selina.

01:22:06.416 --> 01:22:08.041
You are big boss' daughter?

01:22:12.499 --> 01:22:14.874
And you lied to me as a clerk.

01:22:16.707 --> 01:22:18.499
You are Macky's fian'ce?

01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:22.249
Great,

01:22:23.082 --> 01:22:25.541
I have been fooled since I got promoted.

01:22:25.999 --> 01:22:28.332
And no stops till today.

01:22:30.374 --> 01:22:31.791
What do you want?

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.749
How can I make you happy?

01:22:39.457 --> 01:22:40.666
Should I behave like a dog.

01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:42.499
If you say sit, I will obey right here?

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:44.624
Don't say like that.
I am not cheating you on purpose.

01:22:44.624 --> 01:22:46.624
And I reach out my hand if you say hand.

01:22:46.624 --> 01:22:48.624
Or you'll beat me if I disobey.

01:22:48.874 --> 01:22:50.457
My hands are here, come.

01:22:50.457 --> 01:22:52.124
Don't.
Come.

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:55.874
Kit, Kit.

01:22:57.332 --> 01:22:58.332
Lucy?

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:05.457
Sorry, I am leaving.

01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:06.749
Bye.

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:09.332
Kit, Kit...

01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:10.707
Go after him.

01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:13.707
He won't give me a chance.

01:23:13.832 --> 01:23:14.916
I am going.

01:23:15.249 --> 01:23:17.166
You are really going?

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:18.374
Hay, Lucy!

01:23:21.749 --> 01:23:24.416
You are hopeless, not an expert.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.457
Not a manly tricky expert.

01:23:26.457 --> 01:23:28.499
You have to solve it.

01:23:28.749 --> 01:23:29.874
Let me think.

01:23:31.624 --> 01:23:33.624
That's your home.

01:23:33.624 --> 01:23:34.541
Spot on.

01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:36.957
You sign is "The Ultimate Expert"?

01:23:36.957 --> 01:23:37.916
Tricks Expert!

01:23:37.916 --> 01:23:40.041
No, "The Ultimate Expert".

01:23:40.124 --> 01:23:41.957
Where did you see this?

01:23:41.957 --> 01:23:44.666
Anywhere!

01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:49.707
"The Ultimate Expert".

01:23:50.249 --> 01:23:52.749

01:23:52.749 --> 01:23:55.582
To celebrate me.

01:23:59.499 --> 01:24:01.749
"The Ultimate Expert".

01:24:01.749 --> 01:24:04.707
It really suits me.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.916
You made it? Thanks!

01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:09.874
Want my signature?

01:24:09.874 --> 01:24:10.874
Colour or black and white?

01:24:10.874 --> 01:24:15.166
No, I am the one to fit in the name.

01:24:18.874 --> 01:24:20.374
We start business today.

01:24:20.374 --> 01:24:24.332
We can negotiate.

01:24:24.707 --> 01:24:25.666
No problem!

01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:30.916
"Up up and away the shuttle."

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:37.957
It is a mini high voltage device
to make people sing.

01:24:38.082 --> 01:24:40.249
The latest from the States.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:41.582
Wonderful!

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:51.041
My is Quickly Hand to take off pants.

01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:53.499
Product of my dad 20 years ago.

01:24:58.374 --> 01:25:00.374
A fruit basket.

01:25:00.374 --> 01:25:01.166
Stop.

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:01.999
What?

01:25:01.999 --> 01:25:03.457
The Ultimate Expert.

01:25:03.457 --> 01:25:04.332
Be careful.

01:25:17.624 --> 01:25:22.207
Not easy to trap me.

01:25:23.166 --> 01:25:24.541
Where to get the grape?

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:26.124
The fruit basket.

01:25:26.416 --> 01:25:27.874
Careful-Bomb.

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:29.416
Nothing.

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:31.582
Only if the nut is.

01:25:37.707 --> 01:25:39.624
Lucky he didn't use chemical weapon.

01:25:39.874 --> 01:25:42.791
We have to be careful.

01:25:42.999 --> 01:25:45.457
Do I have to go to the hospital?

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:46.416
We are so close.

01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:48.416
I have to go with you to the hospital.

01:25:48.416 --> 01:25:50.374
No. 7 bus stop downstairs & travel 8 stops

01:25:50.374 --> 01:25:52.499
to the O.P.D. of Kwong Wah Hospital.

01:25:52.749 --> 01:25:54.832
You are so good to me.

01:25:54.832 --> 01:25:55.832
I should.

01:25:56.791 --> 01:25:57.957
Good business?

01:25:57.957 --> 01:26:00.499
Macky, I have told you not to help.

01:26:00.499 --> 01:26:03.624
I know, that's why I had asked
"The Ultimate Expert".

01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:05.624
I didn't tell you?

01:26:07.416 --> 01:26:08.249
Go!

01:26:08.249 --> 01:26:09.249
Bye!

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:12.416
Lucy will engage tonight.

01:26:12.499 --> 01:26:13.666
So fast?

01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:15.666
Macky want to do it quick.

01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:17.332
Kit angered Lucy.

01:26:17.332 --> 01:26:19.041
They are only angry with each other.

01:26:19.791 --> 01:26:20.791
What shall we do?

01:26:20.791 --> 01:26:21.832
Go to find Kit, quick.

01:26:21.832 --> 01:26:23.541
And say sorry to Lucy, that will be O.K.

01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:25.166
I will find him.

01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:27.416
Can you deal with "The Ultimate Expert"?

01:26:27.416 --> 01:26:28.791
Of course.

01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:31.332
I have my strength.

01:26:31.332 --> 01:26:32.791
I have one more secret weapon.

01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:33.791
What weapon?

01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:35.916
It's-secret.

01:26:37.582 --> 01:26:39.291
Don't ask.

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:40.707
- Oh!
- You are not young.

01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:48.957
Kit is over there.

01:26:50.082 --> 01:26:51.041
How do you know?

01:26:51.041 --> 01:26:54.707
I recognize by his hair.

01:26:54.707 --> 01:26:55.874
How could you.

01:26:56.249 --> 01:26:58.457
"Chi Man Kit"

01:26:58.457 --> 01:27:01.416
Kit...Kit...

01:27:02.249 --> 01:27:05.416
Kit...Kit...

01:27:06.999 --> 01:27:10.791
Lucy is engaging with Macky tonight.

01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:12.916
Engage only, no problem.

01:27:12.916 --> 01:27:15.207
But they can go to bed.

01:27:15.207 --> 01:27:16.291
What go to bed?

01:27:16.291 --> 01:27:18.332
It's a physical thing.

01:27:18.332 --> 01:27:21.457
The man and woman get excited.

01:27:21.499 --> 01:27:24.624
And after pre-play, the man will put his...

01:27:24.624 --> 01:27:26.666
His what?

01:27:27.541 --> 01:27:29.291
Loosen his belt.

01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:30.416
Oh!
And...

01:27:30.416 --> 01:27:31.999
the bride would take her...

01:27:31.999 --> 01:27:33.374
Her what?

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:37.916
Take off her red handkerchief...

01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:40.166
And what's next?

01:27:40.166 --> 01:27:42.291
Start going to bed.

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.249
What did he say?

01:27:46.249 --> 01:27:50.041
It's urgent, go to say sorry to Lucy.

01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:51.124
Yeah! Yeah!

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:53.582
I don't believe you.

01:27:53.582 --> 01:27:56.291
The masked man was dad.

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:57.957
He was hit twice by you.

01:27:57.957 --> 01:27:59.791
We wanted to cheer you up,

01:27:59.791 --> 01:28:00.916
but we did the wrong thing.

01:28:00.916 --> 01:28:01.582
Really?

01:28:01.582 --> 01:28:02.374
Yes.

01:28:02.374 --> 01:28:03.957
- True.
- Let's go.

01:28:03.957 --> 01:28:05.041
But, never mind the girls.

01:28:05.041 --> 01:28:07.957
No, they are important.

01:28:07.957 --> 01:28:09.666
Marry her and then you can torture her.

01:28:09.666 --> 01:28:12.916
And then make her to be a whore.

01:28:12.916 --> 01:28:14.207
Don't give her up to somebody else.

01:28:14.207 --> 01:28:16.207
Keep calm.

01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:18.707
That's my "girl-friend" only.

01:28:18.707 --> 01:28:19.624
Not by me?

01:28:19.624 --> 01:28:20.582
No.

01:28:31.416 --> 01:28:33.999
Boss, things are O.K. in the garden.

01:28:34.707 --> 01:28:35.957
Be careful.

01:28:35.957 --> 01:28:37.916
Kill the three of them.

01:28:42.041 --> 01:28:44.207
Boss, a group of lion dance coming.

01:28:44.207 --> 01:28:46.957
2 for lion dance, one is the bait.

01:28:46.957 --> 01:28:48.291
Can't see the face.

01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.707
Yes, right.

01:28:49.707 --> 01:28:50.791
Must be them.

01:28:55.749 --> 01:28:57.207
Must be them.

01:29:10.624 --> 01:29:14.499
Don't beat me...it's me...it's me.

01:29:14.499 --> 01:29:15.624
My God!

01:29:16.624 --> 01:29:17.707
Are you alright, Mr. Ching?

01:29:17.707 --> 01:29:21.207
I am O.K., why did you hit?

01:29:21.207 --> 01:29:23.416
- What's wrong with you?
- I am sorry...

01:29:23.416 --> 01:29:27.207
They are my old friends.

01:29:27.207 --> 01:29:30.541
We celebrate with the lion dance.

01:29:30.541 --> 01:29:31.916
I am sorry, I don't expect this.

01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:33.291
Sorry the two of you.

01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:34.332
I help you.

01:29:36.249 --> 01:29:38.916
Lucy, think carefully.

01:29:40.624 --> 01:29:42.457
Love is not a child's game.

01:29:43.291 --> 01:29:44.874
What can I do?

01:29:45.541 --> 01:29:48.666
Kit will come if he loves me.

01:29:49.582 --> 01:29:52.124
All these days we have been dating.

01:29:52.124 --> 01:29:54.124
He never said "I love you".

01:29:55.499 --> 01:29:57.791
Don't argue with love.

01:29:57.791 --> 01:29:59.666
And no foolishness.

01:29:59.666 --> 01:30:01.124
Of course Kit loves you.

01:30:01.124 --> 01:30:03.999
What not tell me, not a waste of time.

01:30:07.416 --> 01:30:08.999
I check if he's come.

01:30:24.999 --> 01:30:26.457
Nobody, come.

01:30:31.457 --> 01:30:32.541
Come.

01:31:10.874 --> 01:31:11.707
Hi!

01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:14.541
Hello!

01:31:16.332 --> 01:31:17.707
Help yourself.

01:31:17.707 --> 01:31:18.499
I will.

01:31:18.499 --> 01:31:19.166
Help yourself.

01:31:19.166 --> 01:31:20.291
Congratulations.
