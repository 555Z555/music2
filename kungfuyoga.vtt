00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.640
Monk Xuanzang of Tang-Dynasty China went west into India in search of Buddist Sutras

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.600
His pilgrimage initiated the close ties between the two kingdoms

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.160
Later Tang China sent his envoy Wang Xuance to India

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.480
He made a remarkable contribution

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.840
to the development of relations and cultural exchanges between China and India

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.520
In AD 647

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.520
Arunasva, leader of Magadha Kingdom's elephant legion in India

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480
attempted to seize the throne and make himself king

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.200
On Wang's second mission to India

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.800
Arunasva led his army to waylay...

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.200
I am General Bhima

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.960
here to rescue you by the command of Her Highness Gitanjali

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080
Get on the horse

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.200
Ambassador, Arunasva has attacked Magadha and the city of Rājagaha has fallen

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.680
General Bhima shall escort you back to the Great Tang Empire to request military aid

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.520
along with some valuables and treasures as tributes

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.520
General, the fate of Magadha is now in your hands

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.360
General, we have crossed the border of the Tang Dynasty

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.560
Ahead of us lies a frozen lake

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.960
I am afraid it cannot support our weight

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.680
Please wait for me here

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.000
I'll go ahead to find a safe way to pass

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.160
Wang Xuance safely crossed the frozen lake

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.520
When he looked back

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.840
he saw only a vast expanse of whiteness

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.120
Bhima and his men had disappeared

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.440
Everything seemed like a dream

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.040
Later, Wang Xuance, aided by troops from Tibet

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.120
returned to Magadha

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.160
to defeat Arunasva and his 3000-strong elephant legion

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.920
creating the military miracle of defeating a country by one man

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.440
But what about Bhima and the treasures of Magadha?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.160
Where had they gone?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.200
Until his death, Wang had no answer

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.880
Wang wrote a memoir called A Journey to Central India

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.000
narrating the events during his mission to India

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.880
Later...

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.680
- In his next lecture, Professor will explain          - class dismissed

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.240
how Wang Xuance single-handedly overturned a country

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.920
Roll-call will be taken. Please don't be tardy

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.840
Tutor, let me help you

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.800
No, I can do it. Thanks

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.200
Miss

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.320
We can pack these artifacts ourselves

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.280
You can leave now

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.640
Bye bye!

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.720
You are more popular than these artifacts

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.720
Replicas... only replicas

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.960
Pigments on Terracotta warriors are mostly natural minerals

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.640
Red is cinnabar and green is malachite

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.560
Blue is azurite and purple is barium copper silicate

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.600
This reagent can accurately show the mineral's compositions and color

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040
and will not damage the Terracotta warrrior

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.080
Come over here

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.960
This is the result of our latest research

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.560
You will find color restoration much easier

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.480
- Hello, director              - Hello, everyone

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.200
Jack's discovery

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.280
is an enormous achievement for our institute

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.280
- Yeah                - You can go back to your work

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.920
Yes

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.680
What's up? Tell me

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.560
I just love your no-nonsense style

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.480
Let's go... to your studio

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.880
To my studio?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.520
Why to my studio?

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.960
Let me tell you

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.760
From the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan India

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.200
a lady PhD has come

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.960
Lady PhD from India?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.320
obviouly to seek after your color restoration technique

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.920
Jack

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.520
This is Dr Ashmita from the Palace Museum Research Institute

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.080
of Rajasthan India

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.840
Nice to meet you, Professor Chan

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.640
Your reputation precedes you

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.080
Your continuing research about the Kingdom of Magadha

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.160
has filled a gap between China and India

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.240
Thank you so much

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.280
Just call me Jack

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.240
Jack

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.720
Doctor, how are you?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm good, thank you

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.400
I'm Zhu Xiaoguang, Professor Chan's TA

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.600
You're Zhu Xiaoguang?

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.880
Your thesis is absolutely brilliant

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.560
You've seen my thesis?

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.280
We published it together

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.640
My name is Nuomin. Welcome to China

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.960
Hi, Nuomin

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.360
Welcome

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.320
Our work is nothing without Professor Chan

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.560
Of course

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.040
Professor, your research into Magadha is impeccable

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.640
However, I have an important clue that might help you

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.480
Please

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.720
Look at your ears!

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.960
They are red!

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.240
This is the map left behind by General Bhima

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.520
I believe that the lost army and the treasure they were protecting

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.520
are somewhere on this map

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.720
Where did you get this?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.480
This was passed down in my family

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.920
This map is a thousand years old and is badly damaged

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.160
I can't tell anything

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840
Let's give it a try

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.200
Xiaoguang, be careful with it

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.680
Yes

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.760
See if it can be restored

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.680
Okay

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.640
The reason I came here

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.560
is to invite you to explore and solve this thousand-year-old mystery with me

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.840
We could increase the cooperation in archaeological research between China and India

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.280
It would also be inline with the "One Belt, One Road" policy

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.200
So well said!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.480
Ashmita, your tremendous political awareness surprised me

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.440
Our professor Chan is the best archaeologist in our country

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.280
- So regarding this exploration             - No, no, no, just one of them

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.880
He is the only choice

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.480
I'd better get going. Goodbye

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.120
Director!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.000
By the way

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.360
Ashmita

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.840
Jack's guest room here

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.200
is very comfortable

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.600
Okay

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.600
Director!

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.400
This thing... throw it away

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.720
I will get you a new one

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.920
See you

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.960
Bye bye

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.040
Goodbye, director

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.520
Nice guy

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.760
So, let me show you to your room?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.760
Sure

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.000
These holes are caused by worms or they stand for lakes?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.080
or they stand for lakes?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.600
We will find out in a minute

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.640
She seems to have known we possess this technology

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.120
And now, for you right leg up over your head...

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.080
It's too hard for me

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.920
Xiaoguang, move over

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.320
Your turn

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.320
Cool!

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.400
Can I join?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.520
There are many yoga fans in China

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.360
Good, very good

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.480
So much

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.640
- Thank you, professor            - Good job, professor

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.080
This is nothing compared to Yoga practice

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.560
- I learn from her                 - Enjoy it

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.960
You won't be joining us?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.520
No, I've been fasting lately

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.640
I'll just have some of this

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.280
So, you're into fasting over here as well

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.840
Yeah, Chinese fasting is very similar to Indian...

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.440
Au revoir (French: Goodbye)

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.880
You mean Upavasa (Fasting)?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.720
Au revoir (Goodbye)

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.640
Upavasa (Fasting)

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.480
Bon appetit

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.600
So, does he always cook like this for you?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.040
First time

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.560
Xiaoguang, look

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.280
Is he always so energetic?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.120
First time

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.880
- Did you see that?                    - First time!

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.600
Let's go to see this chap

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.480
who is the son of my good friend

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.080
My friend spent his life

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.840
searching for the Magadha Treasures

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.120
His son might have kept those findings after he died

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.840
Jones

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.640
Uncle Jack

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.080
Skip uncle, just call me Jack

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.680
Jack

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.440
Look at you. Haven't seen you all these years

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.560
Now you look just like your dad

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.360
When I was small

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.720
didn't you say I looked better than my dad?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.720
You are a smart-aleck like your dad for sure

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.640
No, I am not like him. You are both archaeologists

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.840
I am only a treasure hunter

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.800
Your dad also thought he was hunting for treasures

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.640
It seems you want to finish off what he started

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.840
On the phone you said you had a nice surprise for me

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.280
What was it?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.280
Come with me

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.000
Jones, the son of a good friend

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.600
- Hello!                     - This is Dr. Ashmita

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.400
It's a real pleasure

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.680
Nice to meet you

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.040
- Jones, this is my...                      - Let me guess

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.120
you must be Dr. Ashmita's assistant?

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.280
Teaching assistant

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.560
May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.520
I'm Kyra

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.480
That's a very pretty name, Kyra

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.480
Thank you

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.240
Look at you

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.040
Your face is turning red

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.000
Professor

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.160
My assistant

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.600
How are you? I am Nuomin

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.920
- Nice to meet                          - Hi!

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.400
Where is Xiaoguang?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.160
Xiaoguang!

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.080
Hi, I am Xiaoguang

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.040
The treasure your father looked for throughout his life

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.160
This is the map

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.880
Professor brought it from India

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.680
Really?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.160
Wait...

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.720
If you want to have a good look at it

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.480
we can work together

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.040
Archaeology... treasure hunting

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.520
You are not hunting treasures

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.160
You raid tombs, which is illegal

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.200
What did you guys just say?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.360
You think about it

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.600
This is the chance

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.120
to prove your father gave his life for something more than just a legend

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.360
Here we are

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.240
This gold coin was found by my father on these very river banks some ten years ago

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.720
He led an exploration team down this river

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.440
but unfortunately, he was the only one who returned

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.560
See, my old man always believed

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.440
this gold coin was somehow connected to the Magadha treasures. But...

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.040
I've been doing years of research, and I still haven't found the missing link

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.880
May I have a look at it?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.800
Please

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.040
Thank you

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.120
It's not just a gold coin

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.440
This is Bhima's family emblem

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.400
You see these three holes?

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.360
This is for attaching it to the armor

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.200
This must have belonged to General Bhima!

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.600
When General Bhima and Wang Xuance got separated in the snowstorm

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.640
Bhima and his men took shelter in a cave

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.280
however an avalanche hit and they all got trapped inside

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.000
General Bhima must have escaped and then drawn the map!

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.280
If this is true, it should be upstream from here

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.360
Xiaoguang, you two check the nearby water temperature

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.560
Yes, professor

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.440
Okay

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.720
Let's go up to see which mountain is avalanche prone

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.160
- Okay?                        - Okay

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.440
Let's go

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.640
Xiaoguang, scan the surrounding terrain

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.320
Well, according to your coordinates

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.640
it's just three hours upstream

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.720
and you'll find the entrance to the Twin Dragon River underwater passage

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.760
This is as far as the drone can go

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.760
You're on your own now

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.640
Keep it up!

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.000
- And be safe                   - Good luck!

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.640
Xiaoguang, we are near the headstream of Twin Dragon River

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.640
Got it

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.640
This is it

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.480
Xiaoguang, we arrived

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.240
Great!

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.480
Little yellow fish, let's see what you can do

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.720
Here we go

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.880
Oh my God!

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.920
That is so cool!

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.760
Yah!

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.720
Let's get her in the water

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.560
Okay

00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.840
Professor

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.760
These are images of the underground river sent back by Jones' robofish

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.080
Stop

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.440
Look

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.680
There's a space above the surface

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.240
Yeah

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.080
Can you find its location?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.840
Yes

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.640
Uncle Jack

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.840
Under the blue banner is the subterranean space I discovered

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.200
About 1 km away from the outlet of Twin Dragon River's underground water

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.440
If Bhima really came out of there

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.680
he must have been under the freezing water at least 7 minutes

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.480
That's impossible, without diving gear

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.400
No

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.600
it's the Fetal Breath-Holding technique in yoga

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.280
Don't forget, before we were born

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.840
we all spent nine months in our mothers' bellies

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.360
It's not that human beings can't survive under water

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.440
it's just that we've forgotten our ability to do so

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.120
World champion free divers can hold their breath for more than eight minutes

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.960
They all practice Yoga

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.320
Hi. Jack

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.360
Long time no see. What gives?

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.560
Want to ask you for a favor

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.320
What is it?

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.560
I am in the Kunlun mountains

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.880
Near the border of China and India?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.480
Right

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.040
What do you need?

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.920
To drill a hole

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.880
A hole for oil?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.320
No, not oil hole. Ice

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.720
Ice hole? We happen to have new equipment for that.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.440
I might have found some treasures

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.320
Treasures of what?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.280
Of ancient India's Magadha Kingdom

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.520
You wouldn't know it. We'll talk more when you get here

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.240
- Okay, see you in three days          - Good

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.360
What else?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.760
Maybe a massage

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.040
If only we could put in some chili

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.640
Professor, this Tibetan tea smells really good

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.960
Try it

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.720
- Thanks                  - You are welcome

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.120
Thanks

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.920
- It smells really good                 - Thank you

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.600
Hey, can you hear it?

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.800
The alpha wolf

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.080
is calling his mates

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.080
Where?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.200
Don't move

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.360
Right behind you

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.800
I see them. Two over there

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.560
The rest are behind the glacier

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.400
Jones,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.680
come

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.360
Where are going?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.400
Meet the wolves

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.360
We must strike before they do...Xiaoguang

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.640
hold the fort

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760
I am in charge now?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.600
It sounds like fun

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.880
I am going too

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.840
Remember

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.440
Wait up!

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.000
We must be meaner than them

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.440
Where are they going?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.360
They are looking for wolves

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:20.640
They are looking for wolves
We are on their turf now

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.320
We are on their turf now

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.680
Wolves' turf!

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.960
We are here to show force

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.120
Show force!

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.440
Kid

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.000
Remember the kungfu I taught you?

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.040
Sure, even the verbal formulas

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.120
Say them to me

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.360
Heart, mind, energy merge to become 3 internal unions

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.200
Heart, mind, energy merge to become 3 internal unions
Fist/Foot, elbow/knee, shoulder/hip merge as 3 external unions

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.040
Fist/Foot, elbow/knee, shoulder/hip merge as 3 external unions

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.080
Avoid long-range raids and attack only within striking distance

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.040
Hit where needed without forewarning

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.280
Knowing the formulas is not enough

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.840
Have you been practising?

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.760
Sometimes

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.640
Sometimes means no. Why not?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.200
Couldn't find a worthy partner

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.760
Just listen to yourself

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.120
This is why I think you are like your dad

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.480
I practise with you to show the wolves

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.040
Okay

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.920
I teach you another formula

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.560
When upper body moves, the lower echoes

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.720
- Upper body moves...          - Here it comes!

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.280
Quite firm!

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.160
Impressive!

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.200
Come!

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.480
When lower body moves, the upper leads

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.560
Also

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.000
When upper and lower bodies move, waist moves forward

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.840
When waist moves, the upper and lower bodies conform

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.880
Let your body and the enviroment be one

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.320
Strike with accuracy

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.480
Move with swiftness

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.240
Kid!

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:27.960
What was that move?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.520
"Use your brain"

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.480
Good

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.880
Hit the throat at the top and the groin at the bottom

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.480
You did just the opposite!

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.240
Sorry, I got mixed up

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.080
Be ready to attack someone in the distance

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.880
or someone...

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.760
Loosen up

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.120
...close by

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.400
You say one thing and do another

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.840
I'd rather you just fight and keep your mouth shut

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.080
Kid, you did okay

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.000
Stand up

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.720
Chinese kungfu has its roots deep in the Chinese culture

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.400
There is a lot for you to learn

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.040
When I go back, I should also read up

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.640
The wolf is eyeing me. You two come and fight here

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.960
Never mind him. Let's go

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.960
Where are you going?

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.440
Wait for me!

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.640
Wait for me!

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.840
Let's go

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.200
You leave him there?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.200
Don't worry. He will find a way down

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.080
Xiaoguang, I told you to keep an eye on them

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.360
Professor, since you went to catch the wolves

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.000
I asked them to make a few snowmen

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.960
to scare the wolves off

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.680
- Scare the wolves?           - Yes, scare wolves

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.160
- Yes               - Wolves are coming. Help!

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.000
Quick!

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.640
Grab snowballs! Go!

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.520
Wolves are coming!

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.720
Scare them away! Go!

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.200
They are at my butt, hurry!

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.640
One, two, three!

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.160
One, two, three!

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.520
One, two, three!

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.120
Your thigh alone can feed the whole pack of wolves

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.520
for three years!

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.200
Ashmita's in China and it looks like they found the location

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.320
So, the men are keeping a very close eye on them

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.200
By the grace of God

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.160
we'll finally get that which is rightfully ours

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.880
And the honor of our ancestors will be restored...

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.920
...once and for all!

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.920
Higher!

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.560
It's incredible

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.560
Yeah

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.040
That's unbelievable

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.560
Amazing

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.160
Modern technology really rocks

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.520
Careful

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.600
Watch out

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.880
Good luck

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.120
I will be fine

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.160
Watch your head

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.160
It's beautiful down here

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.600
Bring the equipment down

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.760
Yes, copy that. Right away

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:07.960
Found the vanished Magadha treasures for the Tang Dynasty in AD647

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.480
The location is about 30 meters under the ice surface

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400
inside a huge ice cave

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.120
Another tremendous discovery of yours

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.480
Congratulations

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.040
You are a part of it

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.680
Hands up! Stop

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.160
Move it! Get over there!

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.480
Watch it

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.560
The melted water from the glaciers

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840
in the course of its movement

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.280
creates an ice lake

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.760
This is an englacial river

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.160
Through this river

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.320
we found this site

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.720
General Bhima and his men must have found this cave while...

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.840
...taking shelter from that snow storm

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.480
The avalanche hit

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.400
they all got trapped inside

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.240
With the clothes they were wearing

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.920
would have frozen to death in no time

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.720
What is this thing?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.120
I may have found the remains of the Magadha soldiers

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.240
Hold it for me

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.080
No

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200
Take it

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.440
For archaeologists, this is nothing to be afraid of

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720
No big deal!

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.800
What did you see?

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.360
The bodies are still intact because they are frozen

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.560
Are you scared?

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.120
I am here. Nothing to be afraid of

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.760
It's real gold

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.880
This is Magadha gold coin

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.600
Kyra

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.440
What's that piece of ice you're trying to kill?

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.360
It's just Bhima's... headrest

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.120
His headrest?

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.960
Thirteen cases of gold!

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.640
Don't move!

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.120
Get down!

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.840
No one fires!

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.400
Get up!

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.480
Come here!

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.840
Easy

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.160
Some call it "destiny"

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.880
Some may call it "meant to be"

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240
But I call it...

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.120
I make it happen

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.880
Who's he?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.400
It's not important for you to know who I am

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.480
What's important is

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.920
to know that everything here belongs to my ancestors

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.840
Who's this guy?

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.240
He's the 79th...

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.560
Don't get into the history

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.520
Get into the facts, and...

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.520
Everything here belongs to the Gitanjali family

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.320
No!

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.360
Everything here

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.120
according to the law, belongs to the government

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.920
In here, I'm the government

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.800
Bring all the treasure up

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.480
Tie them up

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.720
and let them freeze to death

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:00.760
Yes boss!

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.160
Go! Go! Go!

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.280
Jack!

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.000
Put that gun away!

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.680
He's just a professor

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.000
Go! Go!

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.480
Come!

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440
What are you hiding?

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.520
Nothing

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.600
- Check her out     - Okay

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.840
Go! Go!

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.560
Give it to me

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.800
- Go! Go! Go!        - Okay

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.000
Jones!

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.720
Stop! Don't move!

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.840
My God!

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:20.800
Thanks

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.640
- Come on         - Okay

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.920
Stop right there!

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.800
Make sure no one comes out alive

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.200
- Yes, boss!                  - Seal them off

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.840
Professor, we will freeze to death

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.200
Xiaoguang, there's a knife next to you

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.000
Grab it with your teeth

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.320
Toss it to me

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.920
Are... are you sure?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.280
Archaeologists often deal with human remains

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.480
What's to fear? He's been dead for 1300 years

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.160
I am thinking of finding a new job

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:22.880
No need!

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.400
Yoga

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.200
Can you do it?

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.040
Of course!

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.560
My arm... don't do it

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.320
Jack

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.640
Yes?

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.000
Let the breath move up the spine

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.480
from the perineum to the third eye

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.960
Let your lungs fill with air

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.320
but focus on the third eye

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.760
Now release the breath

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.000
Let it flow back down the spine

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.240
Feel the spine guide the body

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.360
Inhale...

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.800
...Exhale

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.800
Inhale...

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.160
...Exhale

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.800
Got it?

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.560
Not really

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.040
I'll do it my own way

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:25.960
Okay

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.920
After you

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920
Come on, Jack

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.080
Just... just one more step

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.680
Jack! Jack! Jack!

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200
You okay? What?

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.280
Jack! What? Your stomach?

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.640
Jack! What? Yes! Okay!

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.800
Okay!

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.440
Okay!

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.240
Okay! I'm going to look for help

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.120
Just stay

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.280
I'll be back

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.720
Professor Chan

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.040
The results indicate that your health is back to normal

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.960
Yet we recommend a few more days of in-hospital observation

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.480
Okay, thank you

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.480
You are welcome

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.680
Professor Chan

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.640
Director Liu is here

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.200
- Professor Chan           - Director Liu, good to see you

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.200
Please sit

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.320
Professor Chan

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.800
You found the Magadha treasures en route to Tang Dynasty

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.800
Another feat for archaeology of China

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.160
and the whole world

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.800
Our job is to unearth more cultural relics and treasures

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.080
Did you catch those raiders?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.360
Our police officers intercepted them on the highway

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.200
Look!

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.480
Greetings from some leading comrades

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.720
You can read them later

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.840
I have to hurry back to the site

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.840
Some urgent matters to take care of

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.280
Get some rest

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.600
Appreciate your hard work

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.520
Okay! Goodbye!

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.960
- Okay. Thanks          - Take care of him

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.560
Thank you

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.720
Bye

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.040
Professor, so many greetings

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.640
That's not what matters

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.080
What matters is we have fulfilled Wang Xuance's wish

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.160
Found the soldiers who went through ordeal with him

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.600
They were nameless fighters

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.120
But they are all part of history

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.000
Professor!

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.600
Look!

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.600
What?

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.200
Diamond of Magadha in auction next week in Dubai

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.680
Ashmita forwarded it to me

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.320
Professor, she left you a message

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.480
Jack, it's not just a diamond,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.520
it's the key that unlocks the Magadha treasure,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.200
we must get it back. Ashmita

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.520
Jones has committed crime of theft,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.280
we need to get back the diamond and return it before too late

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.680
Jack,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.040
see how well connected I am in Arabia?

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.040
When I told the prince you were my buddy,

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.600
then what happened?

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.880
He immediately invited you to the camel races

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.600
He even personally drives us there

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.920
Don't just look around. Thank the Prince

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.480
Thank you Your Highness for your hospitality

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.360
You're welcome

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.800
Look, the one with the red tag is my dad's camel

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.240
The one with the black tag is the Prince's

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.160
If your family's camel wins, what will be the prize?

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.640
Do you see those cars?

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.960
How much does one of those cost?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.400
The winner walks away with one of those

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.200
Your family must have won many cars before

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.600
My dad's camel has never won yet...

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.920
Faster!

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.240
What is the remote control for?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.480
Moving the whip

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.840
See? There is a whip

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.440
Hey, pal. I am not here for vacation

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.040
I know

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.920
Tomorrow

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.320
you must win the bid for the diamond for me

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.160
Go! Go!

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.000
Don't worry. Everything is ready. We will get it

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.800
- Come on!            - It is speeding up!

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.640
Your camel is foaming at the mouth and moving up

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.560
My camel is catching up!

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.880
Faster!

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.960
- Red! Red!                    - It's catching up!

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.640
- It's overtaking!         - Come on! Amazing!

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.760
Go! Faster!

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.480
I finally won!

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.560
Fantastic!

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.840
I finally won!

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.720
Xiaoguang, where are you?

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.120
By the pool

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.160
I don't see him here

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.160
Do you?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.520
I find Jones

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.000
Come over quickly

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.800
Coming

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.240
So big?

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.960
How to wear it?

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.040
It is not that big

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.120
There is one two times bigger

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.160
That was the rough stone

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.280
This way please

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.280
Thank you

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.760
Ladies and gentlemen

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.000
Welcome to today's auction

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.120
The diamond that we are about to bid on today

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.240
is a staggering 212-carat one-of-a-kind treasure

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.960
Do you have to wear so little?

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.320
Everyone wears a swimsuit on the beach

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.280
What's wrong with mine?

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.240
I don't care what other people wear

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.320
But I have a problem with what you're wearing

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.160
Why are you blushing again?

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.000
90 million dollars lady in the corner. Thank you very much

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.040
- Raise it            - 90 million dollars!

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.720
We are already to 100, a million dollars to the young lady in white

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.120
110 right here in the corner

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.200
110 million dollars! Do I hear 120?

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.320
120 million dollars

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.480
- Again                - We've got 110 right now

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.720
120 million dollars! Thank you very much!

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.520
Just a second

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.360
What?

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.000
Hope nobody bids again

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.960
I don't think so, already too high

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.880
130 million dollars!

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.640
It's the Prince, Dad

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.400
The Prince?

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.280
Dad's friend

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.480
We've got 130 million dollars, do I hear 140?

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.000
The Prince is also here

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.960
Just tell him not to bid

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.800
He has more money than me

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.880
We don't have enough money in the account

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.360
I don't care!

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.480
I want the diamond!

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480
No more bidding

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.720
150 million dollars! Gentlemen in the corner

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.600
150 million dollars!

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.720
Dad, 150 now!

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.960
We don't bid anymore

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.080
Consider it a favor to me

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.760
What favor?

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.320
If it were 1.5 million, I can help you

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.880
Now we are talking about 150 million

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.880
It is the key to the treasures...

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.680
I know

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.280
you are the best archaelogist

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.240
Can you guarantee

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.000
that you will find the treasures?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.080
160 million dollars!

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.240
Lady in the white!

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.600
Who told you to raise the placard?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.480
Just now didn't you tell me to hold it up?

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.480
I...

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:29.440
Jack!

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.440
No, listen to me

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.760
That is the diamond of Magadha Kingdom

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.600
It's also the key to the treasure

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.760
I don't want to hear it

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.160
Just wait

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.120
Maybe someone will make a bid

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.000
Sold!

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.880
Dad, you are so posh!

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.520
160 million dollars!

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.040
Oh my God!

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.880
Everybody!

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.360
Everybody!

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.080
Party on me! Tonight!

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.680
Randall has been outbid

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.920
I'll keep an eye on him

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:03.720
Okay

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.080
Sorry, sorry, sorry, everybody

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.680
The party is over

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.840
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.840
Finally! We've got you!

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.200
Sorry guys, party's over

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.560
See you guys tonight!

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.680
Moon Island on me, yeah?

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.440
Oh man!

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.480
Sorry brother, I know, I'm sorry

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.520
Why did you steal the diamond?

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.440
You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.560
and nothing else

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.000
You archaeologists,

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.400
don't you want an item from the past to see the light again,

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.640
so people can treasure and preserve it?

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.080
The present buyer will surely treasure it

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.680
because he paid a huge price for it

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720
Stop finding excuses

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.680
If we don't bring back the diamond

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.560
because of you, professor

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.920
will take the blame for stealing cultural relics

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.160
Don't worry

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.480
Perhaps we will find the secret behind the diamond

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.120
Now you say perhaps

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.280
That won't do

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.160
What are you guys doing here?

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.480
None of your business!

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.600
Listen to me...

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.960
What are they fighting for?

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.400
- Come here!        - What do you want!

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.160
- What is going on?          - What do you think?

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.120
My hand...

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.240
Dad!

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:21.720
Jack!

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.800
Jack! They want to take my stuff!

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.760
Jack! Help!

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.440
Watch out!

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.120
My hand...

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.760
Jack!

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:29.760
Come on!

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.120
Jack! Hit this low life!

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.560
My hand...

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.400
Go!

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.120
Go!

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.160
Don't hit me!

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.440
For you!

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.040
I'll get the key

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.160
- I'm unlocking it! Jack!          - Shut up!

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.600
- I'm opening it!          - Just open it!

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.680
- I'm opening it!          - Shut up!

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.280
- I'm doing it! It's open!          - Just open it!

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.840
Kid! Grab the box! Run!

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.120
Hurry!

00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.320
Dad!

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.120
Don't give it to me!

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:13.840
Take it!

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.760
Run!

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.440
- Give me that!         - Don't hit me! For you

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.760
My heart!

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.040
Dad!

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.000
- What's wrong with your heart?          - Dad!

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:31.960
Go!

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.320
How's your heart?

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.920
You broke my heart!

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.240
Look after your father!

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.600
Dad, you okay?

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.720
My 160 million dollars!

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.640
Stop!

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.560
They took the diamond!

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.840
Professor is going after them!

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.320
- What?         - They are at the lobby!

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.040
- Let's go. Quick!         - Come quickly to the entrance!

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.880
Boss!

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.840
Go! Go!

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.120
Get in!

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.920
Just go!

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.800
Hold on please

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.920
Line up and follow each other

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.440
What's wrong with you!

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.280
Excuse me

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.240
Sorry!

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.360
Professor!

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.280
What's wrong with you! Come back!

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.320
- Where to find a car?          - Find a car!

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.000
Find a car

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:31.760
Park it well

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.320
Where did they go?

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.560
We have a car! Quick!

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.080
- Can you drive it?        - Go find your own car, quick!

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.120
I have a car!

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.000
- Great! Go!          - That one!

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.960
Calling Station, two super cars are travelling at high speeds in wrong direction

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.280
Nice Kitty!

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.000
Can you speak Mandarin?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
As-salamu alaykum

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.320
Patrol 511, multiple cars are travelling along Sheikh Zayed Road

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.520
in reverse

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.920
Head towards Abdullah Street to block them

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.200
Hold on!

00:49:59.040 --> 00:49:59.800
Just hit it!

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.320
You okay?

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.280
You speak English?

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.360
Calling station, the hummer is armed

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.360
we are heading towards Marina Bay

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:23.920
Xiaoguang, step on it

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.680
Be careful

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.600
Don't panic...

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.720
Don't panic...

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.000
What are you doing?

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.240
My car door!

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.680
Come help me step on the gas pedal

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.840
What will you do now?

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.400
Get back the diamond for your dad

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.160
Okay!

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.640
Take it easy brother. Peace be upon you

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.680
Don't get mad! No matter what

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.440
Jack!

00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.640
I got it

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.320
Good job

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.840
Patrol 511, road block has been setup at the intersection bridge

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.040
Shit!

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.200
Professor!

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.480
A big Tibetan Mastiff!

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.240
Lion!

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.560
- It's a lion?          - It's a lion!

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.320
Nice kitty

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.480
Jackie?

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.120
Same name like mine?

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.760
Little Jackie!

00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.400
Little Jackie!

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.640
Little Jackie!

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.120
Uncle Jack!

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.600
Uncle Jackie...

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.440
Little Jackie!

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.560
Little Jackie!

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.480
Little Jackie!

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.440
Jack!

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.120
Where is the diamond?

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.200
We lost it again!

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.200
Don't get off the car

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.080
Little Jackie! How are you?

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.080
A 160-million-dollar rock went up in smoke just like that

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.040
Look! Kid,

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.800
when will you transfer the money back to my account?

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.120
I saw the one on the motorbike who took the diamond

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.480
It was Ashmita!

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.160
She set us all up

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.560
Never expected her to be a bad person

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.400
It's hard to say yet who is bad or good

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.160
A person must be responsible for his or her own action

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.200
Give back the money

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.240
This is what I like to hear

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.560
You hear it?

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.880
Even if you pay me back the 1.6 million,

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.440
there is still buyer's premium from the auction

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.640
I am still losing money

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.720
I will go to find her in India

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.880
I will need to report to the police station

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.840
Heaven knows how much more to pay for damages

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.080
Any progress on Xiaoguang's and Jones' visas?

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.080
They just got theirs. Will be here tomorrow

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.720
The hall is divided into three parts

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:33.760
and consists of nine bold arches

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:39.520
They used red sandstone and is plastered with white shell plaster

00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.800
- Coco, it's been a while!     - Nuomin!

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.080
Professor, this is Jiang Wen

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.320
Professor, how are you?

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.720
Hi, foreign student here?

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.080
Yes, I am from Beijing, doing postgraduate research in history

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.080
I am also Professor Ashmita's Chinese tutor

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.240
Excuse me, Doctor

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.880
Professor Chan from China

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.360
Please to meet you

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.560
Honour to meet you

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.080
Nice meeting you!

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:00.720
Nice to meet you!

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.440
And you've come all the way from China

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.280
Yes

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.040
Is that you?

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.600
Yes, that's very much me

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.400
But the one I met in China...

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.520
I know who you're talking about!

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.920
Class dismissed!

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.160
Thank you Madam

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.040
Please come, come with me

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:16.800
This way

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.400
In order to find you

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.520
She had to pretend to be me

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:26.240
Truthfully she is the 68th generation descendant of Princess Gitanjali of Magadha

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.360
Princess?

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.000
This is a big garden

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.200
She lives here by herself? Wonderful!

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.760
Here comes our Princess, Professor Chan

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:05.880
Professor

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.280
Say something

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.920
Welcome to India, Jack

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.480
There's no need for that. I've come for the diamond

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.080
Jack, thank you for helping me find it

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.560
I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.360
But I had no other way of making sure you'd come to India

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.520
After all, you're China's greatest archaeologist

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.080
Just one of them

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.600
Would you mind coming over?

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.720
Sure

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.520
Please sit

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.880
Jack

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.040
Meet my sister

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.280
She is not your assistant?

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.920
No, I'm her younger sister

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:38.800
Hello

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.720
Hi

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.920
Jack, we need you

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:46.240
Help us use the diamond to solve the mystery of the Magadha treasure

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.720
What's so special about this diamond?

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.680
Jiang Wen, could you please explain it to him in Chinese?

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.480
My pleasure

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.440
Eye of Shiva. Whoever possesses it shall possess the entire world

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.000
After Shiva was reincarnated,

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.280
his Third Eye remained in the mortal world

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.960
Legend has it that it is the key to Magadha imperial treasures

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.400
A thousand years ago, Arunasva mutinied and usurped the throne

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.440
What he was really after were the imperial treasures

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:27.280
This diamond was most vital

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.280
Who's that guy in the ice cave and Dubai?

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.400
Why does he want the diamond too?

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.520
That's Randall. The last descendant of Arunasva

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.000
Are there any other clues?

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:37.800
Yes

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.360
Ever since this diamond was mined,

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:44.520
it was set on the scepter that symbolized Magadha's supreme power

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.160
So diamond and scepter were one unity

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.000
But how it can open the door to the treasures?

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.160
We're still trying to figure that out

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.200
Jack, do you like your outfit?

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.480
Yes. Just a little bit tight

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.360
It's time to pick up Jones

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.160
Right, you'd better hurry. We contact each other later

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.240
Okay

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600
See you

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.600
This is the clue I was talking about

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.240
This is the Amala Temple

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.120
It was built during the Vedic period

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.800
Legend says that the Magadha treasure

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.240
is somewhere inside one of the 27 temples

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.160
Every year during the festival of the Sun God, the “Path of the Light“ is revealed

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.920
I'm sure if we could find the pathway

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.440
it will lead us to the treasure

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.200
But the festival is tomorrow

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.200
Vedic designers made temples according to astronomical principles

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.960
There's a book about this. We can start from there

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.600
Vastu Shastra

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.400
The oldest book ever written about architectural design

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.640
And I know where to find it

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.760
Strange

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.760
What?

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.280
Why isn't it centered?

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:57.320
In ancient India, people combined architecture and astronomy

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.920
What is King Harsha zodiac sign?

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.960
Gemini

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.760
Wait!

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.560
Look! That's Amala Temple

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.000
Look! The lines match up with constellation Draco! See?

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.200
So it means it's not Gemini

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.840
Thuban. What's that mean?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.520
It means the head of the serpent

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.720
The northern pole star of the constellation Draco

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.720
I think the path to the Magadha treasure

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.760
is located at the temple that matches the star

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.080
But according to the map, it's the smallest temple

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.520
King Harsha might have done this to hide something

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.880
That's a good guess

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.080
But we still need to prove it

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.720
Wait. Let me take a photo

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.600
Okay

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.160
Ashmita and professor have found some clues

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.840
and want us to meet them here

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.040
This is the most popular local bazaar

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.960
with traditional performing artists

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.880
That dude will surely get a sore throat

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.640
I know about this one

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.840
That is the...Indian rope trick

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.800
You seem to know quite a lot

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.560
This is a traditional trick handed down from ancient India

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.080
When Wang Xuance served as an envoy to the western regions,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.240
his memoir A Journey to Central India also mentioned it

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.360
How did he do that?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.720
Indian magic

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.120
Bravo!

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.400
He will climb up the rope?

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.720
Come with me and you won't get hurt

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.800
Go!

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.040
Go!

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.440
Help!

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.880
no more Rope Trick

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.840
Help!

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:00.720
Go

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:02.800
Snakes

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.560
I hate snakes!

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.560
Got you!

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.320
Jack!

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.320
- Jack!     - Professor!

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:36.840
Jack!

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.520
Jack! Help me!

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.440
Jack!

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.160
Move on

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.560
Come with me or I will get you

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.640
You want it back?

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.680
Throw at him!

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:48.920
Jones!

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:49.880
You okay?

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:50.560
Alright?

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.320
Don't move!

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.080
Go!

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.680
- Uncle Jack! Uncle Jack!   - Stay right there

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.600
Kick!

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.720
- Get in!     - No!

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.320
Come on! Let's go

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.480
Lucky that I got delayed by my visa

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.600
Or else we'd all be snatched

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.720
Watch closely. Find out where they are kept

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.880
Hello Jack. Boss is waiting for you

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.200
And you, you have to stay in the car

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.600
Please come with me

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:51.960
Jack

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320
Welcome to my humble oasis

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.800
Let me show you around

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.760
Actually, you look better without them

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440
Oops...he discovered out about Professor's gadget

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.440
Let these guys play with your toys

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.360
Look! How noble they are!

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.040
Aren't they so beautiful

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.040
Jack

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.920
People say the lion is the king of all beasts

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.400
I disagree

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.720
Jack, these small, ugly little creatures,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.400
there's something special about them you know

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.640
They never lose their objective

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.080
Jack! Help!

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.480
They wait, hungry, and attack

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.120
when the time comes

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.480
A pack of them can take…

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.880
any lion

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.240
What do you want?

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.840
You know, our ancestor has sacrificed their life for collecting the treasure of Magadha

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.760
But her family has been hiding that from us for past one thousand year

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.960
I want it back, Jack

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.400
Take it. Let them go

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.600
I don't care about the diamond

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.560
I care about you

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.760
helping me, open that treasure

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.880
I don't know if I can

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.600
Aren't you the greatest archaeologist in China?

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.040
Just one of them

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.800
The treasure belongs to the world, not to one man's life

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.080
The origin is not destroyed. Everything is empty

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.120
The material is not different from the immaterial

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.120
The immaterial and the material are one and the same

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.840
Stop!

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.040
Professor

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.960
Sorry for interrupting you

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.680
You know, Buddhism left India for China two thousand years ago

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.880
And it's no longer in fashion here

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.400
Open it

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.560
or they die

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.880
No, no...

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360
I'm a little worried. I go in to have a look

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.240
Be careful!

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.760
So I guess the professor's not going to save us now, huh?

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.400
We'll find a way

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.280
How?

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.520
I mean, I know you're smart, but how?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.320
I'm gonna die!

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.400
Hey, c'mon

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.600
We're all going to die. Everybody dies

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.520
But I'm gonna die now!

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.800
I don't wanna die now

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.280
Stop crying. Come on

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.040
Hey look

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.520
You are having a running nose now, come on

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.320
- Yah I know       - Stop crying

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.840
I need help...

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.120
Help you with... with your nose?

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.040
Yeah

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.320
Make you feel better?

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.360
More...

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.080
Jones!

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:16.840
Xiaoguang?

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.880
Come get us out!

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.840
How?

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.000
Come down, pull up the cage

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.400
I come down?

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.040
Yes

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.000
Okay, just a minute

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.760
Xiaoguang, what are you trying to do?

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.840
I go down to help them

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.080
Too many hyenas down there

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.240
I can see they are all she-hyenas

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.160
They should love...

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320
Tender fresh meat!

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400
Watch out

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.440
Xiaoguang, behind you... in front of you!

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.160
This is for you

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.120
Brilliant, Xiaoguang

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.120
Come on, let's go

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.760
Don't let go

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.280
Guys, hurry up!

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.280
Oh no

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.400
No no no...

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.320
Come on

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.680
I got you

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.560
Ouch! Easy

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.520
Good doggy

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.800
Jones

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.360
Jones! Jones!

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.600
Bad dog!

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.360
Bad dog!

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.040
Really bad dog!

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.280
So strong!

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.200
She's so strong!

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.840
Jones, help me!

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.640
Jones, help!

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.080
Xiaoguang!

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:25.960
Grab my hand! Help me!

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.160
Hold tight!

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.120
- Don't let go!      - She took a snap at me!

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.920
- She bit me! My fresh meat!     - I got the belt

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.720
Help!

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.960
My tender fresh meat!

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.440
Bless you! That way

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.040
What should we do?

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:51.960
Ferocious!

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.040
- Jump!    - Me next!

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.240
Xiaoguang!

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.000
Now what?

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.160
We will get out

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.280
the same way you got in

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.880
When Xiaoguang asks you to run to him

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.520
You run as fast as you can, got it?

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.240
Okay

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.080
I'll distract them

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.600
Come here

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:28.880
Run!

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.080
Find a way to get to Xiaoguang!

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:30.800
Okay

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.360
Run!

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.800
There you go!

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.480
Quick!

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.680
Come on, let's go

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.040
Faster, Jones, faster!

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:00.760
Step on me!

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:01.920
Look out!

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.480
Xiaoguang, come up here!

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:08.960
Watch out!

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.560
Hold tight!

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.520
She bit me

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.920
- It's okay. Don't let go!     - Give me your hand

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.360
It's fine now

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.640
- You okay?      - It's fine now

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.400
Okay

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.560
You're bleeding

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.280
It hurts!

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.120
Will it cause infection?

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.480
Can you suck it the blood out for me?

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.680
No way. You'd better go to hospital

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040
Don't even bother to ask her

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:36.760
- Let's go     - What?

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.440
Okay

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.720
Come, let's go, go

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.280
Do we have a plan?

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.200
Just figuring it out

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.560
Look

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.600
This is the Temple of Thuban

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.480
Can we go in?

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.680
I don't think so

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.000
Yes, we can

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.120
Follow me

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.120
Come on, move

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.240
Please don't wear the shoes

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.560
Please go out

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.640
You're right

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.600
Take care of him

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.440
Get him out of here

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.960
You two, open the gate, let's go

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.880
These are the constellation of the ancient India

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.400
Give me the sceptre

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.360
Give it

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.800
I love Indiana Jones!

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.880
Are you kidding?

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.560
Are we going to wait for the sunlight?

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.920
Technology!

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.840
Put the light up there

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:30.600
Turn on the light

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.160
Here are the 27 signs of the zodiac

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960
Twenty Seven?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.720
In ancient India, there were 27. You didn't know that?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320
What's your sign?

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:28.920
Aries

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.840
Ashwini, Bharani, Krittika... These three make up Aries

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.160
Stop boring me with your silly superstitions

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.160
Just focus

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.400
Gemini

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.160
Gemini

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.200
Hold tight!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.120
Hold tight!

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.160
Oh my God!

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.000
Be quiet

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.040
Okay

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.520
Don't move

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.560
I'm sorry

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.560
I'm sorry, too

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.000
Oh shit!

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.960
Don't move

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.600
Good! It's gone

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.400
Thanks

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.440
Jack!

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.400
How could you do this to me?

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.280
I promised that I'd return the diamond

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:04.920
Jack!

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280
Jack!

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.320
Another one?

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.280
It's the same one!

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.240
Same one?

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:10.920
Jack!

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.360
Jack! Do something!

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.240
Sorry!

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.160
Jack!

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.360
Hold tight!

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.320
I can't!

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.480
Don't let go!

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:38.800
Okay! You're safe!

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.440
- Yeah, I'm okay, Jack          - Don't worry!

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.760
Did you see the cave?

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.600
Where?

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.440
- Okay? I count to three!         - Okay, okay

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.240
Go

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.680
- Three!           - What?

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880
You okay?

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.480
Just hold on. You okay?

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.520
Namo Amitābha

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.040
I think... maybe there's a way out

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:17.600
Okay

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.120
Come

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:21.880
Come on

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:25.800
Here. Boss

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.000
Are you guys having fun?

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.200
Yeah

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.640
I... I like...

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.160
We like... rock climbing

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.640
You go first

01:19:59.200 --> 01:19:59.760
Follow him

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.360
Yes Sir

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.160
Jack!

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.400
Guys

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.920
Guys!

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.000
Don't go... don't go yet

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.240
Don't leave me up here

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.440
This is for what really has value today

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.880
This is passion, devotion, dedication

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.480
No one can do this anymore

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.680
Light it up!

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.880
Right! Let's go!

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.840
Guys! Get the gear. Let's start

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.760
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.600
Stop!

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.680
Please!

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.160
Respect history...

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.880
Go, go, go...

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.320
Hey Jack

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.720
Do you know how much the global gold reserve is?

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.440
It's 32 thousand tons

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.440
And this is much more than that

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.040
And of course

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.280
We have all these boxes full of treasure

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.000
Open the cases

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.440
Take it easy

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:13.840
Guys!

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.280
Hey guys!

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.520
Can you help me down?

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.960
Let me figure it out

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.000
We'll come back to you

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.120
Please don't go

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.200
Please don't go, man

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.240
Don't leave me here

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.680
What is this stuff?

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.880
Useless!

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.280
No gold inside

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.280
What are you doing?

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.720
This is about medicine

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.600
This one is Buddhism

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.240
You just don't get it!

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.800
He who possesses of the Eye of Shiva possesses the whole world!

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.560
But it never meant power and money

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.360
This is the knowledge and wisdom to help people live better lives

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.040
The modern world was built by these ideas

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.840
You're just too blind to see it!

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.920
We are living in the modern world and this is all rubbish!

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.360
This is a treasure

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.280
It has the power to transform all of us

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.400
Now, according to Indian law...

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.000
Don't try to teach me the law of my country

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.000
I know it better than you

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.720
And don't you forget, Jack

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.760
I follow the law of nature

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.240
Only the strong survive

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.320
Hey! Somebody's down there

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.120
We have company, guys!

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.240
Just take care of it!

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.320
Let's go

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.240
Do you know why this bridge is broken?

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.760
The sea of bitterness has no bounds

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.160
Turn your head to see the shore

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.840
What is all this bullshit...!

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.360
Run!

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.000
No!

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.280
Come on

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.640
Never touch a woman's hair!

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.440
Come

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.560
This way

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.360
Go! Go...

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.640
Jack!

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.320
Jack!

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.960
Leave her alone!

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.920
Really? You worry about yourself!

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:31.640
"Eighteen strokes to subdue the dragon"

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.720
"Eighteen kicks to tame the tiger"

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.880
Bodhidharma, from India!

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.080
"Mystical kicks in succession"

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.640
Chinese Kung Fu!

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.600
If you kick my legs again

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.320
The girl dies

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.800
Don't kick him

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.040
Gotcha!

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120
Good kick!

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.920
Don't you dare!

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.800
I told you the treasure doesn't belong to you

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.160
It belongs to the whole world

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.400
It belongs to the people

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.040
Perfect

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.240
Put it down

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:34.520
Honey!

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.120
You okay?

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:37.960
Yah, you?

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.440
I'm fine

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.200
Good
