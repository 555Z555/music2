WEBVTT

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:12.083
Act decently.

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:13.916
Or I will tell the doctor.

00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:15.666
Do you still have a stomachache?

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:19.375
Yes, I went to the restroom twice.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:32.291
Sing-sing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.041
Hi, Man.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.708
My cousin, how are you?

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.708
I am an experienced police officer.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:41.791
To me, this minor injury is
just like having whiteheads.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:42.833
But he is different.

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:45.166
He never had a chance to work
with a superior like me.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:48.333
You're not my superior
and you're no longer a police officer.

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:49.958
You've been suspended by the department.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.500
I am just protecting you like a witness.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:54.708
I was framed.

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.333
The truth will come out sooner or later.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.041
When I resume duty, you will regret it.

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:01.625
Stop it, don't argue anymore.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.833
Tell him to have more ambition.

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.666
-For example, go undercover.
-All right.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:07.291
Undercover?

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.041
Don't ask him to go undercover again!

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.833
I hate undercover cops the most.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:15.958
Sing-sing, you promised me
you'd never go undercover again.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:18.708
Yes, but I'd rather go undercover
than protect this scumbag.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.625
With my abilities,
why would I need your protection?

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.291
But you were attacked over 30 times
after you got suspended.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.375
-What?
-Come on.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:27.750
Stop arguing! I will give you some soup.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:31.375
How do you feel? Any problems?

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.500
I have a headache and I feel a bit dizzy.

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:36.250
No wonder you've been refusing
to leave the hospital.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.333
The nurse here is very pretty.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:43.250
I burned my hand.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:45.333
Miss, when can I leave the hospital?

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:46.958
Stop looking!

00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:48.625
You don't even care that I burned my hand!

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.333
Go and rub some medicine on it.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:53.000
-Stop looking!
-Who's looking?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.666
What are you doing?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.000
-It was dangerous, didn't you see?
-What are you talking about?

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:13.750
-Are you a pervert?
-Stay down!

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:16.958
-Hey, that's enough!
-No, he--

00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:18.958
Don't think I'm a pushover.
Try again if you dare!

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.750
Be careful!

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:26.458
You're a pervert!

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.875
I will remember you!

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.125
Control, I am Chow Sing-sing.
Did you call me?

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.458
-Yes.
-Good.

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.833
I've just destroyed
a notorious group of killers

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.833
and arrested the criminals involved.

00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:58.916
Come and lock them up.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.375
-Tell him I helped too.
-Officer Lai told you to come now.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.375
I am protecting a witness, I can't leave.

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:05.666
Officer Lai told you to leave everything
and come now.

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:07.333
-Leave everything?
-Yes.

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:08.375
Okay, over.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:09.708
Hey.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:11.666
Don't move. Let me pick up the gun first.

00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:17.416
Where is Sing-sing?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.000
Everyone, face the wall now!

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:20.791
What happened?

00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.291
The headquarters called him.

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.458
Hey, this test tube is leaking.
Give me a cup instead.

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:32.458
Okay.

00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:37.958
I'll take it to the lab now.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:39.625
What's the situation?

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:41.125
It's a homicide.

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.833
Is the victim a man or an animal?

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:47.750
A man.

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:50.541
Why does he have a tail?

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.166
Hey, aren't you a chemistry teacher?

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:54.333
Who are you?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.750
I'm Chow Sing-sing, you taught me
chemistry in the first movie.

00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.708
I don't remember ever teaching chemistry.

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:01.041
I'm the legal medical examiner.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.500
Who are you?

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:03.875
Chow Sing-sing.

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.083
-What did you ask me just now?
-Nothing.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.458
You're just here to make trouble.

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.416
-Have you seen Officer Lai?
-Which one are you talking about?

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.458
That scumbag who claims to be
Dirty Harry Clint Eastwood.

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.875
His nickname is Dominant Lai.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.166
You're stepping on
that scumbag's foot now.

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:22.125
Are you hurt?

00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:24.208
Is it cool to be stepped on in public?

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.208
Yes.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.083
About the homicide...

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.750
This homicide is very cruel.

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:30.708
The victim is a rich man
named Million Wong.

00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.208
His hands were tied to the bed
and he was stabbed with an ice pick.

00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:35.166
There was semen left on the bedsheet.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.708
The way he was killed is similar
to a scene in a recent movie.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:39.791
Why did you ask me
to come here so urgently?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.250
Take a look at this picture first.

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:45.458
Hey, why did you
take my picture in secret?

00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:46.583
I hate that.

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.291
This is the picture of the victim.
You two look exactly the same.

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:51.833
-But he had a mole.
-How can this be?

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:53.291
What do you want?

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:55.208
I have something good for you.

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:01.500
-I'm sorry, I'll wipe your face.
-Hey.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.000
Where did you get the tissue from?

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.541
It was next to the bed.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.125
-The victim used that to wipe himself.
-Wipe what?

00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:08.166
What do you think?

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:11.291
It's all right, just treat it as a facial.

00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:13.083
Am I right, Officer Lai?

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:15.750
Where is the cup with the victim's semen?

00:07:15.916 --> 00:07:16.916
Here it is.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:19.000
Why is it empty?

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:27.500
Young man,

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:30.458
do you know that it's a serious crime
to destroy evidence?

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:34.083
Unless you obey my instructions,
or you'll be demoted.

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:40.041
Your mission is to pretend to be
Million Wong and go to his home

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.000
to keep an eye on his wife, Judy Tong,

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.958
and his friend Tailor Lam,
who always took advantage of him.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.750
They are the most likely suspects.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.791
You want me to go undercover then?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.500
The actual terms
could be whistleblower, snitch,

00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:56.916
outsider, informer, or betrayer.

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:01.416
I'm begging you,

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.583
don't make me go undercover.

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.041
I promised my girlfriend
I won't go undercover anymore.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.291
Otherwise, I will lose a wife.

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:11.833
Please be merciful.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:16.125
Please show mercy to me
like you would to Beggar So, sir.

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:20.125
You can refuse to go.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.000
Find someone to get his statement.

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:23.958
An officer intentionally destroyed
important evidence.

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:29.625
You're so fierce.

00:08:29.916 --> 00:08:31.750
Are you trying to scare me?

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:37.000
Even if I refuse,
another person would be willing to go.

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:41.208
I'll just do whatever you want.

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:42.500
You're so annoying.

00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.000
Madonna also begged me eight times
and I didn't give in to her,

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:48.000
let alone to you.

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.875
-You mean McDonald's?
-Madonna.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.916
Just do me a favor
and excuse me from this.

00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.500
No, you must go.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.791
You are too dominant!

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.833
Dominant Lai is my nickname,
don't you know?

00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.916
Damn it, don't be such a bully in life!

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.208
I am an expert in Tiger Crane

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:05.416
and I have over ten years of experience
of Shadowless Fist and Skeleton Kick!

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.791
Even if I don't move my limbs,
I can kill you with my tongue.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.625
Do you really need me to go?

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:15.291
Well, you must have your reasons
to make me go undercover.

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958
After much consideration,

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:19.583
I'll respect your decision.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.416
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:24.833
Actually, I love the term "whistleblower".

00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:27.625
Remember, I didn't force you.

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.041
You are silly. We're on the same side.

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:32.333
-How could you say that? Gosh.
-Right?

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.875
Do you take me as a friend?

00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:35.125
We're colleagues.

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.083
Lend me a few hundred thousand
to buy a flat.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.916
I can tell that you're not a loyal friend.

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:43.875
I'll support you no matter what.
Work hard to solve the case.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.250
My future cousin-in-law.

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.250
It's nice to see you.

00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:50.125
I'll buy you tea,
but lend me 20,000 dollars first.

00:09:50.416 --> 00:09:52.750
You've already been suspended.
How dare you borrow money again?

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:53.916
Don't embarrass me.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:56.541
Can't I report a crime?
I was indecently touched by a woman.

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:57.875
Hold it. Hey.

00:09:58.083 --> 00:09:59.875
You said you'd support me
no matter what, right?

00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:01.541
Yes, as long as you go on this mission.

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.208
Great, I want him to be my assistant.

00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.750
The fourth seat in the third row.

00:10:26.916 --> 00:10:28.166
Do you need to be so scared?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.291
It's none of your business.

00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:31.791
Hey. Why are you so late?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.916
I was busy at the station.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.916
What's happening in the movie now?

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:39.375
The woman is with the man on the bed.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.125
She is killing the man with an ice pick.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.875
Hey, I want to tell you something.

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.000
What is it?

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:49.791
I quit my job at the school.

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958
I plan to help my mom
with her flower shop.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.375
Well, I hope to get orders
from hotels and restaurants.

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.666
-What do you think?
-Good, very good.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.041
-I want to tell you something too.
-What is it?

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:07.791
I will go undercover again
starting tomorrow.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.416
What did you say?

00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:13.708
I said I will go undercover again
starting tomorrow.

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.333
-Aren't you tired of that?
-I am.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.250
But my boss isn't. I have no choice.

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:22.833
Who will you be this time?

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:24.625
A husband of a woman.

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.833
Which woman?

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.250
Keep this a secret.

00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:34.875
Judy Tong, who always appears
in gossip magazines.

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.708
That's all I can tell you.
The rest is confidential.

00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:39.083
You don't mind, right?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.916
Do you need to be so scared
or are you taking advantage of me?

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:47.666
I definitely want to take advantage,
Miss Snow White!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.916
Enjoy, I'm leaving.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.750
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:52.708
Man.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.583
Hey.

00:11:56.791 --> 00:11:57.666
Man.

00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:58.916
Hey.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.708
-Where are you going?
-What are you doing?

00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.958
Where are you going?

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:03.000
Hey.

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:05.166
You promised me
you won't go undercover again.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.250
You're not trustworthy!

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.000
You silly girl.
This is an order, I can't help it.

00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:11.666
Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Eve.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.791
You promised to have dinner

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:13.875
-with my family.
-Excuse me.

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.250
No, go and piss again.

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:18.208
I just won't be there,
but the food will be as delicious.

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.000
-Be good.
-Okay.

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.375
You want to be the husband of Judy Tong?

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.708
She is androgynous and weird.

00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:26.333
Will you sleep with her on the same bed?

00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:27.583
I'm going there to work.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.750
I will never do that!

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.916
But if I get drunk,
I don't know what will happen.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.541
You're going to sleep with her?

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:36.583
I will date other men in return.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.041
You're unreasonable.

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.666
You think I want to do this? It's my job.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.208
-Excuse me.
-No!

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.500
-I've already pissed again.
-Go take a dump then.

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:45.500
I don't care.

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:48.083
If you cheat on me,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.041
I will do ten times worse than
what you did.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.791
If you sleep with one woman,
I'll sleep with ten men.

00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:57.000
As my girlfriend,
how could you say that to me?

00:12:57.083 --> 00:12:58.250
It's not only that.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.041
If you cheat on me,

00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:02.333
I'll do what the female lead did.

00:13:02.666 --> 00:13:05.166
While you're asleep,
I will tie you to the bed

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:06.916
and stab you to death with an ice pick!

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.583
Tie me to the bed? Stop joking.

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.791
Caution is the parent of safety.

00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:18.791
What are you doing?

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:20.000
Nothing.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.208
-You're done showering?
-Yes.

00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:26.541
You should write
the spring greetings first.

00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:29.958
-Fine, I'll do it tomorrow.
-No, do it now.

00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:33.666
BE PROSPEROUS

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.375
HARDSHIP WILL BE OVERCOME

00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:42.166
My hand is tired.

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:43.875
Are these fine for now?

00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:45.625
You can use your foot then.

00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:51.666
Incredible.
You really wrote with your foot.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.125
Of course, don't think I'm dumb.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:54.708
You're amazing.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.416
Do you love me more and more then?

00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:00.875
If you're really so amazing,

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.750
eat noodles with your foot then.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:08.250
What did you say?

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:18.833
Hello.

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:21.708
Hello, is this Mrs. Wong?
I'm calling from the police station.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.125
We found your husband, Million Wong,
in the New Territories.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.125
Really? Where is he now?

00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:28.875
In the police station.
Come and pick him up.

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:30.166
Thank you.

00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.416
Mrs. Wong, someone sent you
some expensive underwear.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:40.375
Idiot, everyone knows
that I don't wear underwear.

00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:42.041
-You can have them.
-Okay.

00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:45.291
-I'm going to pick up Mr. Wong now.
-Okay, madam.

00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:53.250
Are you Jelly Tong, no...

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:54.500
Are you Judy Tong?

00:14:57.708 --> 00:14:58.875
Call me Judy.

00:15:00.416 --> 00:15:01.625
Have you found my husband?

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:03.750
Yes, we found him in the New Territories.

00:15:03.916 --> 00:15:05.291
He seems to be in a confused state.

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.083
We suspect he experienced trauma
to his head.

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.666
He doesn't have any money on him.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.125
Maybe he was robbed.

00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:12.291
By woman, I suppose.

00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:16.458
Don't any of you smoke?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.708
I am sorry, Mrs. Wong.
Smoking is not allowed in this room.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.375
Would you put me in jail then?

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:23.375
No.

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:24.833
But you'll be fined 5,000 dollars.

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:27.583
Here is 10,000 dollars.
I will treat you to a cigarette.

00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:30.833
Mrs. Wong, money is not everything
in the world.

00:15:33.083 --> 00:15:34.250
It isn't.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.375
But you're doomed if you don't have money.

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.125
You're not my husband.

00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.625
I didn't say I was.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.625
He is obviously your husband.

00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:08.916
I'm not acknowledging him.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
You fooled around
until you're in a confused state.

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:13.500
Hey, say something.

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.458
What could I say?
I don't remember anything.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.291
She is your wife.

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:19.375
No.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.375
I didn't say you were.

00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:24.541
You are a couple. You fight and reconcile.

00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.250
Say nice things to her and you'll be fine.

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.666
I won't go home with him.
I came to see if he was dead or not.

00:16:28.916 --> 00:16:31.125
I have a faint memory
of having a pretty wife.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.416
Isn't she pretty?

00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:33.666
What do you think?

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:36.125
Although she is not pretty,
she really is your wife.

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:38.000
I am sorry, police can't tell lies.

00:16:38.208 --> 00:16:40.291
I heard my wife has a nice figure.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.541
Doesn't she have a nice figure?

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:43.375
My wife doesn't wear underwear.

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:45.291
I peeked earlier. She's not wearing one.

00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:48.333
I'm just guessing.

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:51.666
You bastard,
you haven't completely gone crazy.

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:54.583
You have a sharp tongue!
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:57.916
Yes, go home and decide
whether to laugh or cry.

00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:59.250
Are you telling me what to do?

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:01.541
I've been enduring you.
What kind of attitude is that?

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.250
You reported
that your husband went missing.

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.875
You give an attitude now that he's found.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.625
Should we take you to Shenzhen?

00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.583
Did you know we can lock you up
in Shenzhen for a year without a trial?

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.833
What are you looking at?
You're rude. Look at me.

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.166
How long can he protect you?

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.125
In July 1997, I'll arrest him too.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.583
Who are you?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.708
I'm a police officer from China.

00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:22.875
You look familiar.
When did you go to China?

00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:24.291
I didn't.

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:25.583
You didn't?

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.333
You look like a criminal who steals money
from various governments.

00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:30.083
Buddy, get me a car.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:31.708
I want to take them with me,
including her.

00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:32.708
Me?

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.458
Don't interrupt.

00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:36.500
Are you going to cooperate?
You want to destroy peace?

00:17:36.583 --> 00:17:38.291
Do you want me to arrest your mother?

00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:41.208
Good thing it's my mother, not me.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.166
Are you done? Damn mother.
I'm very sleepy.

00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:46.166
Don't be ridiculous, I'm not your mother.

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.500
Go home if you feel sleepy.
Come home with me.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:49.791
-Don't go.
-Let's go.

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.125
Hey, where is my gun?

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.291
Isn't it good that they left? Let them go.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.208
Bullshit works, young man.

00:17:56.916 --> 00:17:58.125
How dare you call me that?

00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.583
You're already suspended.

00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:01.291
If you pose as a cop again,
we'll arrest you.

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:02.416
-Hey, don't be so bad.
-What?

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.791
I posed as a Chinese police officer.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:05.083
-Let them arrest me.
-You--

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.458
Stop or I will really apply
to be a Chinese police officer

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:09.708
and cut your mother's pork in 1997.

00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:13.625
Good thing my mother is a vegetarian.

00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:21.625
-Mr. Wong.
-Mr. Wong.

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:34.875
Why are you so amazed? This is your house.

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.083
I lost my memory.

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:37.250
So what?

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.083
That's not what I mean.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.083
Do you know who she is?

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.208
Mom?

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.875
Mr. Wong, why did you call me that?

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:51.250
Damn it, Toirepepa is
our Japanese housekeeper.

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:52.625
-What? Toilet paper?
-That's right.

00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:54.250
-Right.
-It's a Japanese name.

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:55.416
-Right.
-Dad.

00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:57.833
Dad.

00:18:58.583 --> 00:18:59.750
-My dear son.
-Dad.

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:01.083
I missed you so much!

00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:02.250
Damn you!

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.708
He is the son of the gardener.

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:06.125
-He called me Dad.
-He calls everyone Dad.

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.125
-Greet everyone.
-Dad.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.916
-I'm glad you're back.
-Do you know who he is?

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:15.916
-Does he cook curry?
-He is your dad.

00:19:16.083 --> 00:19:16.958
What?

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.583
-Good boy.
-Dad.

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:23.750
-It's good to see you again.
-Do you know who he is?

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.958
-Maybe he's the gardener or something.
-He's your nanny.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.583
What?

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:30.250
-Mr. Wong, do you want to have some milk?
-I'm not thirsty, maybe later.

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:34.625
Do you know who he is?

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:36.416
-Don't tell me he's my brother.
-That's right.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.333
-What?
-You treat him as your brother.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.666
I see.

00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.666
Call his name
or he will come and bite you.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.750
No way.

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:45.916
-What is his name?
-Use your brain!

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:48.375
Hey. Dolly...

00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:52.333
David, Peter, Maria, Rose, Gigo,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.583
Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Balenciaga,

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.666
Wong Jing, Ng Man Tat, Gordon Chan!

00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.166
That dog should be euthanized.

00:20:07.416 --> 00:20:09.250
His name is Dolly Law!

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:11.250
-You forgot his name.
-Hey.

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:13.208
I called him Dolly many times.

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:15.333
It's Dolly Law, not Dolly.

00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:16.583
You forgot "Law".

00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.541
That's why he kept chasing after me.

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:20.583
Mr. Wong.

00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.083
-The vet has arrived.
-Which dog should I draw teeth from?

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.208
This way.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.750
Thank you, doctor.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.916
Lower your voice.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.250
Hey.

00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:54.166
You always fall asleep
when having a massage.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.291
Why are you so excited today?

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:58.000
I don't know why.

00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:02.916
-Hey, do you need to do that?
-Mr. Wong, you love it.

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:04.666
-Really?
-Yes.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.666
Forget it then.

00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:17.458
Why are you so interested
in this old picture?

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.750
-I lost my memory.
-So what?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.333
I mean,

00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:24.625
I was wondering why I was wearing boxers
to take a picture.

00:21:24.708 --> 00:21:26.416
That's so strange.

00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:30.250
You know, I convinced you for so long
before you wore any underwear.

00:21:30.416 --> 00:21:33.000
You refused to wear anything at first.
You wanted to look sexy.

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.583
Look at how dissatisfied you look.

00:21:35.833 --> 00:21:37.583
I didn't expect him
to be that kind of person.

00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:38.916
What?

00:21:39.416 --> 00:21:41.541
I don't remember being
that kind of person.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.375
If not for your looks,
I'd suspect that you're an impostor.

00:21:45.583 --> 00:21:48.708
An impostor? I told you I lost my memory.

00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:50.583
Did I say or do anything
before I went missing?

00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:52.250
Who knows what you said or did?

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:53.833
Toirepepa.

00:21:53.916 --> 00:21:55.791
-Why are you calling her?
-To prepare your bath.

00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:57.083
She's sleeping.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.833
What can I do for you, Mr. Wong?

00:21:59.916 --> 00:22:01.458
You always move so quietly.

00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:04.291
-Mrs. Wong, he said I move quietly.
-Everybody is the same

00:22:04.375 --> 00:22:05.416
in this house.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.125
You're not the only one
who knows how to move quietly.

00:22:17.208 --> 00:22:19.458
-You want a beating? Hello?
-Pretending to be dead?

00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:22.500
Hello, Officer Lai. I am Judy Tong.

00:22:22.833 --> 00:22:23.916
-What can I do for you?
-Speak!

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.083
The person you found is not my husband.

00:22:26.208 --> 00:22:27.083
Make it thinner.

00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:29.083
How do you know that?

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.583
He doesn't know anybody.

00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:33.250
He thought the gardener's son was his
and he was bitten by our dog.

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:36.625
I asked him to shower and he really did!

00:22:36.875 --> 00:22:38.541
He only did it four times a year before.

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:41.500
When we got married, I begged him
for a week and he still wouldn't shower.

00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:44.916
We made him shower in the detention center
and he got addicted to it.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.875
Hey, he really is your husband.

00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:49.750
Treat him nicely.
Otherwise, I won't let you off easily.

00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:52.041
How could you say that?
Are you really Officer Lai?

00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:53.666
If I'm not Officer Lai,
then am I Leon Lai?

00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:55.333
Go to hell.

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.583
That doesn't sound like your voice.

00:22:57.666 --> 00:22:59.458
That voice wasn't mine.

00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:01.083
You want to be beaten up?

00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:07.833
Officer Chan.

00:23:07.916 --> 00:23:09.708
Mrs. Wong, what can I do for you?

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:15.041
I don't think my husband is my husband.

00:23:15.208 --> 00:23:16.750
I don't understand. Please explain.

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:18.708
Officer Lai found my missing husband.

00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:19.958
He looks exactly like my husband.

00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.041
But when we got home,

00:23:21.208 --> 00:23:23.666
I noticed that he is
not my husband at all.

00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:26.333
Officer Lai found your husband
who looks exactly like your husband.

00:23:26.416 --> 00:23:28.333
But you noticed
that he isn't your husband.

00:23:28.458 --> 00:23:29.625
He is not my husband at all.

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:32.458
So you suspect that
your husband's look-alike

00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:33.500
is not your husband.

00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958
More or less.

00:23:35.041 --> 00:23:36.416
Then you should talk to Officer Lai.

00:23:36.833 --> 00:23:38.083
I called him,

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:39.958
but there was a fake Officer Lai.

00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:42.416
He told me that my look-alike husband
is my husband.

00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.750
That fake Officer Lai pretended
to be him and told you

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.000
that your look-alike husband
is your real husband.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:50.416
-More or less.
-I have a suggestion.

00:23:50.583 --> 00:23:53.416
Go home, take a warm bath,
and drink a glass of hot milk.

00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:55.000
See Officer Lai tomorrow morning.

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:56.875
Then you will discover
that your look-alike husband

00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.333
is your husband again.

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:01.416
So you don't believe or trust me either.

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:02.958
Do you think I am crazy?

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:04.416
More or less.

00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:06.500
He really is an impostor.

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:07.875
I am an impostor too.

00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:12.125
Actually, I am Andy Lau.

00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:14.125
It's 12:30 a.m. on Lunar New Year's Eve.

00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:15.541
Gosh, it's 1:00 a.m.

00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:18.291
-Happy New Year. Let's be prosperous.
-What are you doing, Officer Chan?

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:19.666
-That's all, bye.
-I'm not done yet.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.833
You are great, my dear classmate.

00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:29.250
Happy New Year!

00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:30.875
I'll be in trouble because of you.

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:33.000
She is so rich.
Do you know that she can sue us?

00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:35.583
But we are upholding justice
and maintaining the law.

00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:37.875
Now you're spreading injustice
and ignoring the law!

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:39.958
Why did you poke me so hard? Go to hell.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.625
-What?
-I poked you and you hit me?

00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:44.750
I will kill you!

00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:46.791
Hey!

00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:50.541
Officer Chan, I left my lighter.

00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:52.208
Why do you have black eyes?

00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:54.625
I don't get enough sleep,
so I have dark circles.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.333
Mrs. Wong, Happy New Year.
I hope your dreams come true.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.416
I wish you luck, prosperity,
success in studies and eternal youth.

00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:02.875
Anyway, be happy. Happy New Year.

00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:04.750
All of you are crazy!

00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:31.166
What noise is that?

00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:34.291
What are you doing?

00:25:38.333 --> 00:25:39.333
What are you doing?

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.333
-You made me your assistant.
-Yes.

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.583
You told me to protect you
with a gun 24/7, right?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.291
-Yes.
-That's what I'm doing.

00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:48.166
I didn't tell you
to cut through people's ceiling, man.

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.041
Yes, you didn't.

00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:51.583
Go away, you idiot.

00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:59.125
I don't need your protection here. Go.

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:02.083
No, I have to watch you closely
and see if you'll cheat on my cousin.

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:03.833
-Mrs. Wong, you're back.
-Yes.

00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:11.083
Judy is back, get out of here.

00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:16.458
Hey, a fat woman has gone into the room.
What shall I do?

00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.833
You're back? Where did you go?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.250
I just went out for wonton noodles.

00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:28.583
-Wonton noodles? Very good.
-Yes.

00:26:28.916 --> 00:26:31.833
In order to finish my mission,
I need to use my power of seduction.

00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:34.958
I will flirt with her
and make her tell me the truth.

00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:38.041
To find out the truth,
I need to use the power of my charms

00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:39.666
in order to expose his real identity.

00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:07.625
Judy!

00:27:07.833 --> 00:27:10.791
Million!

00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:12.750
Judy!

00:27:12.958 --> 00:27:14.916
Million!

00:27:45.833 --> 00:27:47.958
Sorry, I am tired today.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.875
I am going to sleep in the study room.

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:54.875
Benevolent God,

00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:58.666
please give me a strong man in my dream.

00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:00.875
Thank you.

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:09.958
He's really strong.

00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:11.291
And he's naked.

00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:14.166
Thank you, God.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.458
I'm coming!

00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:16.791
GOD OF PROSPERITY

00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:21.708
Hurry up, arrange the presents properly.

00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:24.750
-Mr. and Mrs. Wong are coming down.
-Mr. and Mrs. Wong!

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:28.750
Mr. Wong, may your business thrive,
be prosperous and go smoothly for you.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.625
We wish you good fortune.

00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:33.250
Here is your red envelope.

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:35.708
-We wish you prosperity.
-Hey, you should give them some too.

00:28:35.958 --> 00:28:37.666
I didn't bring any. Give me some.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:39.958
Here.

00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:42.416
Here is your red envelope.

00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:43.958
-Happy New Year.
-Thank you.

00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:45.875
-Mr. Wong.
-Good fortune to you.

00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.833
-Thank you.
-Mr. Wong, what about me?

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:49.916
Hey, you're married, right?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.208
-Right.
-Give it back to me.

00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:52.125
Where is yours?

00:28:52.416 --> 00:28:54.416
-Mr. Wong, I'm not married.
-You got mine.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.458
Yours is with Mrs. Wong.

00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:57.000
They're giving out two per person there!

00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:00.666
-I'm rich.
-Happy New Year.

00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:01.833
-Officer Lai.
-Hey.

00:29:01.916 --> 00:29:03.500
-This is for you.
-Officer Lai.

00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:04.958
This is very kind of you.

00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:07.166
I should since I'm visiting you.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.750
-Happy New Year, Officer Lai!
-Stop.

00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:10.125
We can't be prosperous.

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:12.291
ICAC will investigate us if we do.

00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:15.083
-I wish for your promotion then.
-That's better.

00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:16.583
Mr. Wong, are you all right?

00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:20.958
-His head trauma requires rest.
-Yes.

00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:22.083
Take a seat.

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:24.041
-I will get you some cake.
-Okay.

00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:25.666
Hey.

00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:28.791
So, what have you found?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.583
I tried to seduce her with my body,
but I couldn't get any information.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.208
What if you let someone else try?

00:29:35.375 --> 00:29:38.083
-Do you want to die?
-Sei, pour us some tea.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.500
Yes, Mr. Wong.

00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:41.833
I even asked a suspended officer
to help you.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.500
If you can't find the real murderer,
then commit seppuku.

00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:46.500
I'm afraid I'd be killed before then.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.916
Who dares to be so bold?

00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:56.541
Who is that?

00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:58.166
She's wearing fur.

00:29:58.833 --> 00:29:59.958
It's a woman!

00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:03.000
Be careful.

00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:09.458
Your girlfriend is bald.

00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:16.000
Who are you looking for?

00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:18.500
Tailor!

00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:19.958
Judy!

00:30:22.333 --> 00:30:25.000
Judy, has Million gone crazy?
He doesn't even recognize me.

00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.708
I remember a little. You're Tailor.

00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:28.416
No, you never called me that.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.750
What do you call me? Tell me.

00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:30.916
-Tell him.
-Tell me.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.125
-Is it Damn Richie?
-Damn Richie?

00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:36.958
Damn Richie, you damn pig!

00:30:37.083 --> 00:30:38.666
So it's Damn Pig, not Damn Richie?

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.541
No, I am Damn Richie, Damn Pig!

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.541
-You are Damn Pig?
-You are Damn Pig.

00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:46.666
-Then you are Damn Richie?
-He is Damn Richie!

00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:48.166
Yes, she's Damn Richie.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.791
-She's Damn Richie and you're Damn Pig.
-He's Damn Richie, Damn Fool.

00:30:50.875 --> 00:30:51.708
-I'm Damn Fool?
-I'm--

00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:54.666
All right, let's make it simple.
Just call yourselves Scumbag.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.666
-How can you say that on New Year's?
-What did you say?

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.875
Spit and say that again.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.333
-Bull's-eye!
-Bull's-eye!

00:31:02.416 --> 00:31:03.583
Who is this jerk?

00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:06.666
He is Officer Lai,
the one who found Million.

00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:11.625
I'm not used to dealing with
low-ranked patrolling officers.

00:31:12.875 --> 00:31:13.916
Hey.

00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:17.041
My disco is opening tonight.

00:31:17.708 --> 00:31:19.416
You two should come earlier.

00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:21.958
I've invited a lot of girls.

00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:23.708
You love it.

00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:24.833
What did you say?

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.666
I'm kidding.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.541
Shit, I forgot to visit my dad.

00:31:30.708 --> 00:31:33.458
-How is your dad?
-He's at Wo Hop Shek Cemetery.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:35.958
-You should go.
-I need to go.

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:37.125
-See you tonight.
-Bye.

00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:38.500
I won't walk you out.

00:31:41.041 --> 00:31:42.833
He was Million's best friend
since they were kids.

00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:45.166
He has always coveted Wong's wealth.
He is very suspicious.

00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:47.916
Judy.

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.875
Do you need to put on a moustache
to come out and have fun?

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.291
Can't I do that? You can too.

00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:55.375
It's not necessary to court a woman.

00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:56.875
It's a waste of time.

00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:58.458
If you have money, you'll have women.

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.000
I will throw money at her
until she lies down.

00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:03.166
Then throw more money to make her love me.

00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:07.541
Money is addictive like drugs.

00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:09.250
So you have loads of drugs then?

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:11.291
Which movie star are you pursuing lately?

00:32:11.416 --> 00:32:14.291
I'm not pursuing any movie stars.
My taste has changed.

00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:17.083
Powerful women who have dreams

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:19.041
are more interesting.

00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:21.083
-In what way?
-Look.

00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:24.000
I scored one yesterday
who owns a floral shop.

00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:27.500
What a coincidence, I scored one yesterday
who also owns a floral shop.

00:32:28.208 --> 00:32:30.375
The girl I'm dating tomorrow
has a floral shop as well.

00:32:32.958 --> 00:32:35.375
By the way, which floral shop is it?

00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:39.208
You want to do the same?

00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:42.291
Did you get your wife's permission?

00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:45.208
Don't look at me, I'm very open.

00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:48.208
If Million just wants to have fun,

00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:49.500
I'm fine with it.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.875
I'm going to dance.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.458
Stop touching my head.

00:32:54.583 --> 00:32:55.500
Hey.

00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:57.000
I'm curious.

00:32:57.583 --> 00:32:59.958
What is so nice about that florist?

00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:03.916
I don't know how to describe it.

00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:06.458
Anyway, she got big eyes,

00:33:07.166 --> 00:33:10.125
a tall nose, sexy lips,

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:13.083
and a pair of nice tits.

00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:16.458
-And--
-All right, what's her name?

00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:20.583
Damn, how can I remember
when I've been with so many girls?

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:22.250
Ada? No.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.708
Patty? No.

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:25.708
Cindy? No.

00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:27.500
The point is she's great in bed.

00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:29.583
We did it from the head
to the foot of the bed then back,

00:33:29.666 --> 00:33:32.000
from the bed to the floor,
from the kitchen to the living room,

00:33:32.083 --> 00:33:33.375
from the living room to the kitchen.

00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:35.916
She is so lascivious!

00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.041
She's really lascivious.

00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:39.250
Another thing,

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:42.958
she said the boyfriend
she's going to dump is a police officer.

00:33:45.208 --> 00:33:47.708
Where is she? Introduce her to me now!

00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:49.958
Why are you so impatient?

00:33:50.041 --> 00:33:51.875
I asked her to come. You'll see her later.

00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:53.375
-Really?
-Yes.

00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:55.583
Let me touch up my makeup first.

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:06.458
Really?

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.458
You're so lascivious!

00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:26.708
Baby, give me a kiss.

00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:28.083
All right.

00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:29.916
You're so lascivious!

00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:39.416
What are you doing?

00:34:40.958 --> 00:34:42.083
I'm just looking for somebody.

00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:46.291
Judy, why don't you introduce me to her?

00:35:47.458 --> 00:35:48.416
Judy!

00:35:49.708 --> 00:35:50.625
Hey.

00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:53.833
Damn Richie! Don't steal my girl.

00:35:54.041 --> 00:35:56.250
You're keeping the girl for yourself
and you gave me the elbow.

00:35:56.416 --> 00:35:59.416
-That's not going to fly anywhere.
-You have had enough fun!

00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:00.791
Judy!

00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:04.291
Hey, Man-ching.

00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:05.333
Let me introduce you.

00:36:05.416 --> 00:36:07.375
She's Cheng Man-ching,
my right-hand man in the company.

00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:09.458
-This is Mr. Wong.
-We met before.

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.333
-Right.
-The company won't run

00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:13.458
-without Man-ching.
-Yes, we won't know what to do.

00:36:13.916 --> 00:36:15.000
I won't bother you then.

00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:16.500
No, let's chat some more.

00:36:18.458 --> 00:36:19.583
-What are you looking at?
-What?

00:36:19.666 --> 00:36:20.708
You always look at girls.

00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:22.083
What else can I do then?

00:36:22.166 --> 00:36:23.625
-Dance with me.
-Hey.

00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:40.583
Who are you looking for?

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.375
I'm just looking for someone.

00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:45.166
-That girl earlier?
-No.

00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:47.333
-Are you lying?
-No.

00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:50.916
Can you focus on dancing with me?

00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:57.583
You two are so sweet.

00:36:58.125 --> 00:37:00.708
Where were you? That girl was here.
I was going to introduce you to her.

00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:02.416
-Where is she now?
-She left!

00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:04.041
Next time, if there's a chance, I'll...

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:10.458
-He has a nice hairstyle.
-Yes, I admire it.

00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.833
Big Nose, come to our party tonight.

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:33.291
Why are you still standing there?
Go and invite more girls.

00:37:33.458 --> 00:37:35.375
-Sure.
-What did you say?

00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:39.875
Nothing, I just remembered something.

00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:42.000
-Come, let's try something new.
-Something new?

00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:45.958
Come to our party tonight, Big Nose.

00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:47.500
Why are you still standing there?

00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:50.541
Can't you smile a little?
Did your dad die?

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.791
Come to our party tonight, Big Bust.

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:58.875
It's Big Nose.

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:07.375
Come to our party tonight, Big Nose.
You're included.

00:38:07.458 --> 00:38:09.833
Why are you still standing there?
Go and invite more girls.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.625
It's so hard to earn money.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.083
Why did you come into my room?
My mom will be back soon.

00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:22.291
Your mom?

00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:24.416
I tell her that you're my tutor.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.375
If she finds out, she'll be furious.

00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:29.291
She told me not to let boys into my room.

00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:32.333
Don't kiss boys and don't just...

00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:34.041
do it with them too.

00:38:36.208 --> 00:38:37.583
Should I say my lines next?

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.541
What are you talking about?

00:38:39.708 --> 00:38:41.750
-What? I don't know--
-You don't know?

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.208
During camp last time,

00:38:43.291 --> 00:38:45.583
you came in the middle of the night
and kissed me.

00:38:46.291 --> 00:38:48.500
Okay, I won't kiss you.
I'm going to sleep in the study room.

00:38:49.583 --> 00:38:52.000
I just want to know
why you won't kiss me tonight.

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:54.291
Can I sleep in the study room
after kissing you?

00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:55.250
Give me a kiss first.

00:38:56.958 --> 00:38:57.958
Hey!

00:38:58.708 --> 00:39:00.083
That wasn't where you kissed me before!

00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:02.458
If not there, where?

00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.666
Hey, Judy.

00:39:04.083 --> 00:39:06.708
Don't be too greedy.

00:39:07.208 --> 00:39:08.041
You're so naughty.

00:39:08.833 --> 00:39:10.500
Yes, so what?

00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:14.333
-Come on.
-What?

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:16.416
I'll die if I must!

00:39:17.416 --> 00:39:19.958
Hey, what are you two doing?

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.416
Hey, you have a part too.

00:39:23.833 --> 00:39:26.500
You two are so bad.

00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:28.416
How dare you? I must beat you up.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.458
Hey, don't just hit me.
You should hit her too.

00:39:31.708 --> 00:39:33.625
She is the director, I can't hit her.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.750
You two are so bad!

00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:37.916
You tricked my daughter
and got her into bed!

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.750
You shameless girl!
You have such thick skin.

00:39:40.833 --> 00:39:42.666
You embarrass the family.

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.250
Don't wash your dirty linens in public.
I'll go ahead.

00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:48.541
You bastard, kneel!

00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:52.000
You bastard, you want to leave
after taking my daughter's virginity?

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:54.250
That's not right. I don't like virgins.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.958
How could you say that? You are heartless!

00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:58.958
-You want to leave just like that?
-I'm done with this!

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.375
Go with the script. Do what she's doing.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.000
Look at him, he is absolutely heartless!

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.791
I don't care. I'll talk to your dad.

00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:10.625
-Get married next month.
-Again?

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:11.958
-You refuse?
-You won't?

00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:13.541
Fine, make it quick!

00:40:13.625 --> 00:40:15.208
That's good, as quickly as possible!

00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:17.000
You two should be good from now on.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.666
-I'm busy, excuse me.
-Go!

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.000
-I'm leaving!
-Hurry!

00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:27.583
My mom approves of our marriage.
Let's continue.

00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:29.458
-What? We're not done?
-Come on!

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:31.708
Hey. Time's up, game over!

00:40:34.291 --> 00:40:37.000
You haven't touched me
since we slept in separate rooms.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.625
I've never said a word
about all those women you have.

00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.083
I want you just for tonight.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:44.958
Can't I?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.375
Can't I?

00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:54.125
How did you turn out this way?

00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:56.500
Why?

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.500
Stop crying, I'm not like this.
I am a loyal man.

00:41:05.375 --> 00:41:06.291
Say that again.

00:41:07.791 --> 00:41:10.333
I said I'm a loyal man.
One wife is enough.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.416
Tell me you love me.

00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:23.750
I love you.

00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:27.708
Again.

00:41:29.458 --> 00:41:30.500
I love you.

00:41:36.833 --> 00:41:37.750
Hold me tight.

00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.000
What are you looking at, man?

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.958
I'll look when you're run over by a car.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.041
Turn around. Right now.

00:43:07.291 --> 00:43:10.291
Damn you! You are so cocky
to be wearing patterned socks.

00:43:20.708 --> 00:43:21.708
What are you doing, man?

00:43:21.791 --> 00:43:23.041
I'm just picking up something.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.708
What are you doing, man?

00:43:28.208 --> 00:43:29.375
I'm just picking up something.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.041
What are you doing?
Sweeping the streets? Come inside.

00:43:38.708 --> 00:43:41.083
-I'm just picking up loose change.
-Have some red bean soup.

00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:44.041
Why is there not much business today?

00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:46.000
That's how it is for newly-opened stores.

00:43:46.166 --> 00:43:47.000
No.

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:50.083
I heard quite a few people
came to see you yesterday.

00:43:50.166 --> 00:43:51.500
Yes, how do you know?

00:43:52.666 --> 00:43:53.958
Where is your mole?

00:43:56.875 --> 00:43:57.708
It's there.

00:43:57.791 --> 00:43:59.875
-Good stuff.
-Hey...

00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:03.333
-The red beans are good.
-Don't you think they're chewy?

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:06.208
-Just one bean.
-Of course, you ate my mole.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.541
Does it taste better
when cooked with a mole?

00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:11.458
-You two enjoy yourselves, I'm going out.
-Where are you going?

00:44:11.833 --> 00:44:13.208
To deliver flowers to someone's wife.

00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:14.166
He's not like you.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.500
You're always absent, poor,
and you don't send flowers. Bye.

00:44:16.666 --> 00:44:18.250
-She's right.
-What do you want again?

00:44:18.625 --> 00:44:20.416
I came to have red bean soup
and protect you 24/7.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.666
If you don't like it, I'll leave.

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:25.666
Tailor Lam and his friends are coming
to my home to play cards tonight.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.333
I think I can get some clues.

00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:30.625
You are wise to seek my help.
I was the team's King of Gamblers.

00:44:30.875 --> 00:44:33.041
We'll surely win money tonight.

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:46.291
-What are you looking for?
-Nothing.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.291
How are things?

00:44:50.416 --> 00:44:51.375
Everything's normal.

00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:53.791
Did you bring money?

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:55.833
Don't you know that I'm Frank Drebin?

00:44:56.291 --> 00:44:57.208
Do you have white hair?

00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:59.541
I'm a detective
who doesn't pay for anything.

00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:03.291
Mr. Wong, where is your mole?

00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:04.458
I got it removed.

00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:05.666
It's a mole that brings wealth.

00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:06.666
Really?

00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.416
I have too much money. I don't want more.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
-What a classic line.
-Really?

00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:14.416
That's good, we'll go with the usual.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.416
-What's the usual?
-Gamble in cash.

00:45:16.666 --> 00:45:18.291
Well, regarding that...

00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:21.708
The maximum credit is 200,000 dollars.

00:45:25.625 --> 00:45:26.833
Are those just loose change?

00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:28.125
This is everything I have.

00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:29.916
Mr. Wong, 10,000 dollars is the base fee.

00:45:34.958 --> 00:45:36.250
It's an eight.

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.250
A nine can have the first call?

00:45:39.583 --> 00:45:40.791
Put in 50,000 dollars.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.000
What do you think?

00:45:44.291 --> 00:45:45.458
Add 150,000 dollars.

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:48.166
-We'll get rich with just the base fee.
-Really?

00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:50.666
Follow.

00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:55.250
Hey, show us the money.

00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:58.541
-Where is the change?
-Change?

00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:01.208
-Hey, you over there...
-Wait.

00:46:01.416 --> 00:46:03.083
I'll go and get the money, sit here.

00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:07.000
Honey, give me a few million dollars.

00:46:07.125 --> 00:46:09.416
We have always gambled with our own money.

00:46:09.708 --> 00:46:11.750
Don't you have 30 million dollars
in cash at home?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.833
I forgot where I put them.

00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:16.291
You will remember, you're smart.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.416
-Which one should I discard?
-Well...

00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:21.416
This one.

00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:23.666
-Really?
-Trust me.

00:46:25.208 --> 00:46:26.041
Nine circles.

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:27.458
-I win!
-Me too.

00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:28.416
Three wins in one shot.

00:46:32.916 --> 00:46:33.833
Damn you!

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:35.916
Where is Officer Lai?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.416
He is having fun inside the CID room.

00:46:43.916 --> 00:46:45.416
You bastard! You want to get beaten up?

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.250
-I want to discuss something important.
-Can't you see I am beating up someone?

00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:53.291
I need two million for gambling.

00:46:53.458 --> 00:46:55.333
Two million? Are you kidding?

00:46:56.041 --> 00:46:57.083
How dare you counterattack?

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.750
You must give me two million
no matter what.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.750
Where do I get two million for you?

00:47:04.916 --> 00:47:06.083
Tailor is gambling at my home.

00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:08.583
If I have no money, I'll be exposed.
Then we're doomed.

00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.791
-Hurry!
-Let me go first.

00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:12.166
Agree and I'll let you go.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.125
Did you go to the market?

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:20.416
I'm sorry, I misplaced my loose change.

00:47:20.583 --> 00:47:22.166
They were in the servant's quarters,

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.583
which is in Yuen Long.

00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:25.291
Cut the crap, we're waiting for you.

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.958
-Deal.
-Deal.

00:47:27.208 --> 00:47:29.000
-A pair of eights, your call.
-Really?

00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:31.250
-Then I want to show--
-Wait, pretend first.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.291
Nothing special, just 200,000 dollars.

00:47:34.458 --> 00:47:35.583
Just 200,000 dollars?

00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:37.916
-I'll add 800,000 dollars.
-I will follow you!

00:47:45.708 --> 00:47:46.750
Three eights.

00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:48.500
All right, show hand.

00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.250
-What about the newspaper?
-Include it too.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.416
Three eights?

00:47:52.875 --> 00:47:55.250
Well, it's not much! Follow!

00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.833
I quit.

00:48:02.083 --> 00:48:04.458
I have three Aces. I don't believe
that you've got four eights.

00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:08.708
Don't get so excited when you win.
Don't cry, buddy!

00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.208
Four eights!

00:48:14.416 --> 00:48:16.500
What? I had an eight!

00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:19.333
-You mean the game before you left?
-Of course!

00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.041
But we played many rounds after that.

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:22.458
Why didn't you tell me?

00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:23.916
-You didn't ask!
-I...

00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:29.166
You're back? Did you win or lose?

00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:30.416
You can tell from my head.

00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:31.583
You lost everything?

00:48:31.666 --> 00:48:33.958
-You said you were the King of Gamblers!
-When did I say that?

00:48:34.416 --> 00:48:35.416
I mentioned it.

00:48:36.416 --> 00:48:37.583
What should we do now?

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.458
Give me one million to win it back.

00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.375
I will show them my real power
as King of Gamblers.

00:48:41.458 --> 00:48:42.833
You want one more million?

00:48:43.125 --> 00:48:46.333
I gave you all the bond
and bail money in the station.

00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:48.041
We're being asked to return the money.

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:51.041
If you don't give it back,
you'd better leave by boat and escape.

00:48:51.125 --> 00:48:52.541
Please lend me money for the ticket.

00:48:52.625 --> 00:48:54.458
You...

00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:55.875
-Give us one million more
-You idiot!

00:48:55.958 --> 00:48:57.250
or we're all doomed.

00:48:57.916 --> 00:49:00.458
-Hey.
-What if you lose again?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.583
This is our last resort.
Let's take the risk.

00:49:02.666 --> 00:49:06.291
We're just making a living.
Why are you beating us?

00:49:06.708 --> 00:49:08.041
Who are you beating up again?

00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:09.500
Two racketeers.

00:49:10.041 --> 00:49:12.000
You're beating up
such noble professionals?

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.166
He cheated someone of two dollars.

00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:15.666
Whose two dollars?

00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:18.375
-Mine.
-He even cheated a beggar?

00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:19.708
-Beat him up!
-Beat him up!

00:49:22.916 --> 00:49:24.125
What?

00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:27.000
The archenemy of the God of Gamblers,
Master Hung?

00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:28.750
Hello, how are you?

00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:30.458
I lost so much money
that I need to run away.

00:49:30.541 --> 00:49:32.458
Buddy, ask them not to beat us.

00:49:32.666 --> 00:49:35.000
I will teach you how to cheat.
You'll surely win.

00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:37.375
Sure, but give me a demo first.

00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:49.583
Are you kidding me?
He's not back yet after so long?

00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:53.166
We've finished 16 rounds
and he hasn't returned.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.083
What is he doing?

00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:56.083
He is back.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.000
Everyone...

00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:20.250
-He looks so cool!
-So cool!

00:50:31.666 --> 00:50:33.083
You look familiar,

00:50:33.333 --> 00:50:35.208
but I don't know
who you're pretending to be.

00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:37.916
Take a guess.

00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:03.583
I know! The God of Gamblers.

00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:04.875
Wrong.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.500
It's David Copperfield.

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.000
Deal.

00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:11.291
I have three Kings.

00:51:11.833 --> 00:51:12.750
I have three Aces.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.083
Straight flush.

00:51:14.208 --> 00:51:15.625
Mine is better.

00:51:16.625 --> 00:51:17.458
Four Aces.

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:18.875
Five Aces!

00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.666
What that person taught you really work.

00:51:35.833 --> 00:51:36.833
Win as much as you can.

00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:40.500
I'll take this opportunity to find out
the truth about Million's death.

00:51:42.791 --> 00:51:43.625
One million.

00:51:43.833 --> 00:51:44.666
I will follow.

00:51:50.083 --> 00:51:51.000
A pair of Aces, my call.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.333
Are you stupid?
The straight flush calls it.

00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:54.416
Show hand.

00:51:59.333 --> 00:52:01.000
I don't believe you're David Copperfield.

00:52:01.083 --> 00:52:02.000
I will follow.

00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:04.291
I have 50 cents left.

00:52:05.083 --> 00:52:06.250
I'll get five million as credit.

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:09.000
Forget the money.
If you answer my question,

00:52:09.166 --> 00:52:10.666
I'll consider that you've followed.

00:52:10.833 --> 00:52:11.875
What is your question?

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:18.166
Have you ever thought of killing me?

00:52:22.125 --> 00:52:23.291
Answer me.

00:52:26.708 --> 00:52:28.708
-I...
-Answer me!

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.458
I'm done playing!

00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:37.458
Your question is ridiculous.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.041
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:52:40.208 --> 00:52:41.500
We'll take the money if you're done.

00:52:43.166 --> 00:52:45.250
You've won the money.
Have you found out the truth?

00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:47.166
The truth is...

00:52:47.916 --> 00:52:50.000
I only had a four, but that idiot quit.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.500
-Boss, are you all right?
-Are you hurt?

00:52:55.541 --> 00:52:57.541
Give me back the money!

00:52:58.083 --> 00:52:59.041
We'll return the money.

00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:00.916
But we don't need to share
our winnings, right?

00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:03.500
Don't you need to pay interest?

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:07.166
Pay him according to the bank's rate.

00:53:07.625 --> 00:53:09.958
The interest rate today is cheap,
just 2.75 percent.

00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:13.375
Two million divided by 365 days.

00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:14.791
It's 25 dollars.

00:53:14.875 --> 00:53:16.416
I'll give you 30 dollars. Keep the change.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.041
Give me ten dollars as a tip.

00:53:21.458 --> 00:53:23.375
We wouldn't worry if we did this earlier.

00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:29.333
Any progress on your investigation?

00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:33.333
I noticed that Judy Tong
is becoming really strange.

00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:35.791
I think she has a secret.

00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:37.583
And Tailor Lam...

00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:39.083
Don't just look at the surface.

00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.791
When I was training in Scotland,

00:53:42.291 --> 00:53:44.958
I studied all the extraordinary cases
in the world.

00:53:45.625 --> 00:53:47.750
Including Murder on the Orient Express,

00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:49.583
Death on the Nile,

00:53:49.833 --> 00:53:51.208
Dial M for Murder,

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.500
The Hidden Corpse, and many more.

00:53:55.125 --> 00:53:56.375
I found an important principle.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.333
What is it?

00:53:57.416 --> 00:53:59.666
The most suspicious person
is less likely to be the culprit.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.083
Damn!

00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:03.083
I agree! Like in the movies,
the less suspicious person

00:54:03.166 --> 00:54:04.375
is more likely the culprit?

00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:05.708
You can say that.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.458
Maybe he pretends not to know the victim,

00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:11.833
looks ordinary, is not particularly
tall or short, very strong,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.791
has no inclination to violence,
likes to beat up people

00:54:15.291 --> 00:54:16.500
and loves money.

00:54:16.583 --> 00:54:18.208
He'll cheat people
of even 30 or 40 dollars.

00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:20.708
Based on what you said,
the murderer is you.

00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:22.333
Guys, arrest him.

00:54:24.166 --> 00:54:25.125
Are you crazy?

00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:26.666
Are you mad?

00:54:27.583 --> 00:54:28.750
It's just a theory.

00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:30.208
Going back to the topic at hand,

00:54:30.458 --> 00:54:32.791
if you can't get any clues
in Judy Tong's home,

00:54:32.875 --> 00:54:35.125
go to the office to check
if Tailor Lam and Million Wong

00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:37.708
had any conflicts in business
that may lead to his murder.

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.541
You just said the most suspicious one
isn't the culprit.

00:54:40.666 --> 00:54:42.583
I'm just saying that.
Why don't you go and investigate?

00:54:43.125 --> 00:54:45.250
Let me finish the most
important thing first, okay?

00:55:08.375 --> 00:55:10.041
"I'll love you for 360 years"?

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.458
Damn it, you're totally
ignoring my existence.

00:55:32.125 --> 00:55:33.541
A bitch and a bastard.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.166
A bitch and a bastard.

00:55:40.958 --> 00:55:42.166
I want to kill them!

00:55:42.875 --> 00:55:43.833
Where's the knife?

00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:50.000
Fuck!

00:55:54.875 --> 00:55:55.708
The door!

00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:09.666
Sit anywhere you like.

00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:17.000
-Thank you for your flowers.
-Patterned socks?

00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:19.958
Stop it. You know I have a boyfriend.

00:56:20.583 --> 00:56:23.083
Although he is poor, selfish,

00:56:23.166 --> 00:56:24.833
stingy and old fashioned...

00:56:25.166 --> 00:56:26.375
She's not talking about me.

00:56:26.791 --> 00:56:28.291
He's still my boyfriend.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.000
I can't accept you.

00:56:30.625 --> 00:56:32.250
Hey, don't.

00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:34.625
Don't.

00:56:37.083 --> 00:56:37.916
Don't!

00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:41.166
I will kill you, bastard!

00:56:41.958 --> 00:56:42.791
It's you?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:43.833
It's you!

00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:44.916
It's you?

00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.250
Actually, I meant...

00:56:49.416 --> 00:56:51.125
I will kill you, bastard!

00:56:51.458 --> 00:56:52.708
Don't give her a hard time!

00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:53.875
Why are you holding a knife?

00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:56.125
-Put it down first.
-Wait, listen to me.

00:56:56.625 --> 00:56:58.166
I've followed you for a long time.

00:56:58.333 --> 00:56:59.833
It turns out you're here for this bitch!

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:00.791
Me?

00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:03.041
Three fingers are pointing at you.
Why are you still asking?

00:57:03.541 --> 00:57:05.541
-How dare you try to steal
-I...

00:57:05.625 --> 00:57:07.708
-the wife of Million Wong?
-Well...

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:08.708
-I...
-Let me ask you.

00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:10.166
Who do you love, her or me?

00:57:10.708 --> 00:57:12.083
I was just playing around.

00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:14.708
She was just playing around.

00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:17.583
You were played, you bitch.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.041
You embarrass your family.
You just want money, right?

00:57:20.125 --> 00:57:21.500
Fine, it's just money!

00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:23.166
Here.

00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:26.583
Here's some money.

00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:28.833
What? You got the money.
You still won't leave?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.250
You two...

00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:31.916
Fine, I am leaving!

00:57:32.125 --> 00:57:33.750
Man. Wait, Man.

00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:35.291
This is your home, where are you going?

00:57:35.458 --> 00:57:37.625
Yes, this is my home!

00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:39.916
You two, scram!

00:57:40.541 --> 00:57:42.875
-Scram!
-Man, don't be mad. Listen to me.

00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:44.875
What more do you want?
Wait for me downstairs.

00:57:45.125 --> 00:57:46.916
Let me teach this bitch a lesson.

00:57:47.083 --> 00:57:48.250
Go, what are you doing?

00:57:48.458 --> 00:57:49.291
Fine.

00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.625
I'm seriously warning you!

00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:53.375
Never see my wife again.

00:57:53.541 --> 00:57:56.250
Or I will beat you up
whenever I see you! Get it?

00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:59.416
She's gone. Why are you still acting?

00:57:59.833 --> 00:58:01.708
You were so happy to tell me off just now.

00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:03.125
That's how acting is.

00:58:03.333 --> 00:58:04.875
What do you think
of my performance just now?

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.833
Bad.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.625
Are you kidding? I got a prize
for acting in a drama before.

00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:10.041
But you were really bad.

00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:11.250
I haven't asked you yet.

00:58:11.333 --> 00:58:13.083
Why would you let that woman court you?

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:17.000
She is nice
and she always buys flowers from me.

00:58:17.166 --> 00:58:18.958
So we shop and have tea whenever I'm free.

00:58:19.125 --> 00:58:21.916
Who knew that she was a lesbian?

00:58:22.458 --> 00:58:23.583
I didn't expect that it was her.

00:58:24.166 --> 00:58:26.458
Hey, she is waiting for you downstairs.

00:58:26.541 --> 00:58:27.791
Aren't you going?

00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:29.125
Go!

00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:32.041
I will accompany you every day
after I solve this case, okay?

00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:35.750
I bought you something.

00:58:35.916 --> 00:58:37.000
Really? What is it?

00:58:37.208 --> 00:58:38.041
Patterned socks.

00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:39.041
Burn them.

00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:48.791
Mr. Wong, good morning.

00:58:49.375 --> 00:58:50.458
Good morning.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:54.166
Mr. Wong, good morning,
Mrs. Wong is not around.

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:55.708
-I know.
-There's no power in there.

00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:58.291
It's fine.
I just want to get a cup of water.

00:59:19.416 --> 00:59:20.541
This arrived in the morning.

00:59:27.666 --> 00:59:28.583
What's the matter?

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.083
Nothing, you may go.

00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:32.583
You must have a problem.

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.666
I told you already.
It's none of your business anyway.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:36.208
Go.

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:42.041
ATTENTION

00:59:43.708 --> 00:59:45.000
"Attention"?

00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:54.166
"Don't use a lighter to read."

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:55.916
What does this mean?

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:05.625
It's brandy.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:19.958
CALL ME. TAILOR.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.375
Boss.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:41.000
Hello, Tailor?

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:42.208
How are you?

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:44.000
How did you get my picture?

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:45.916
Through a camera.

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:47.000
I followed you for so long.

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.458
But I didn't expect you
to court this one too.

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:51.041
I think the gossip magazines

01:00:51.208 --> 01:00:53.625
would be very interested
in such hot pictures.

01:00:53.708 --> 01:00:56.666
-Beware of karma.
-I'll surely get my karma,

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:59.500
so I need to save more money
for the future.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.250
If you want those nude pictures back,

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:03.916
come to my office at seven.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.958
What do you want?

01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:13.041
Fire station, please.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:15.708
Tell me, what's the matter?

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:18.833
This is the fire station.
Who is this? Speak.

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:21.916
Are there any raincoats for sale? Thanks.

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.791
Buy them at 7-11, you bastard!

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:26.625
Bastard? What's with the attitude?
What's your ID number?

01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:29.541
-Don't hang up. Hello?
-Tailor, you are going too far!

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:32.250
You will regret it if you don't come.

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.750
That's all. Don't interrupt my exercise.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.500
Mr. Wong, what are you doing?

01:01:52.583 --> 01:01:54.416
I told you, I was drinking some water.

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:14.083
You stepped on my supper!
You have to pay me!

01:02:32.833 --> 01:02:34.166
Miss, who are you looking for?

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.666
I have an appointment with Mr. Tailor.

01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:36.958
Please follow me.

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:43.250
Come in.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.083
Please come in.

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.416
I am so happy to see you.

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:55.083
Find the files for the first half
of the year. I won't take any calls.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.083
Okay.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.833
Take a seat.

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:04.541
Cut the crap.

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:06.791
How much do you want for the pictures?

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:08.958
Please don't misunderstand.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.291
Even if I am not that rich,

01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:14.750
I'm not interested in 100 or 800 million.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.125
Do you think I'm blackmailing you?

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:19.583
All right, name your price.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:23.541
We're friends.
It's not good to talk about money.

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:26.583
Actually, I want to give you money.

01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:31.458
I've checked and confirmed that
your current husband is an impostor.

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:34.333
I can kill him for you and leave no trace.

01:03:34.416 --> 01:03:38.541
And I will give you 300 million
for the land in Wan Chai.

01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:42.375
Go and rob a bank.
That land is worth two billion.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:44.875
Yes, I told you I'm not interested
in only 100 million.

01:03:45.041 --> 01:03:46.791
Two billion is more like it.

01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:48.083
Damn you!

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:50.041
Don't speak foul language.

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:52.208
If you do, it will damage your image

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:54.416
as a pretty lesbian.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:58.625
You're despicable!

01:04:00.083 --> 01:04:01.708
-You...
-What?

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:03.583
Go to the lawyer's office in three days.

01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:05.583
Or I will give out your pictures
in Portland Street

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:07.375
and to the gossip magazines.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:18.625
Hey. What are you looking at?

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.333
Why are you sneaking around?
Are you stealing?

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:22.083
No, there is a beautiful naked girl.

01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:23.583
I don't trust you.

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:25.083
Come and take a look.

01:04:25.666 --> 01:04:28.333
What if you attack me after I look?

01:04:28.958 --> 01:04:31.000
Even if you don't come here,
I'll still attack you.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.333
What happened?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.375
I was attacked by a man in a suit.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:38.625
Hurry, let's chase after him.

01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:41.875
Have you seen a man in a suit?

01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:43.666
This way.

01:04:45.625 --> 01:04:47.250
Thief!

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.083
What noise is that?

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:54.166
Was there a noise? I don't think so.

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:56.166
I will break his head if I see him.

01:04:56.458 --> 01:04:57.833
Go that way. I will stand guard here.

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:08.125
You...

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:13.208
Pervert! Help!

01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.541
This way.

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:18.791
I changed jobs!
Why are you still bothering me?

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.666
-Arrest him!
-Scram, you bitch!

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:42.041
Give...

01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:43.458
Give me back my teeth.

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:14.708
Hey, it's you! This is new.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:16.250
How is it new?

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:20.541
Guess who killed me?

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:21.791
Who?

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:24.875
Hey, give me some hints.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:32.166
It's her.

01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:07.708
You jerk, you're interrupting. Go away!

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.250
You jerk, it's not 1997 yet.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.458
How dare you give me Chinese yuan?
Do you think I am blind?

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:27.375
Die!

01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:40.625
You're back.

01:07:43.958 --> 01:07:46.333
You're panting. Where did you go?

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.333
Let me ask you. Where have you been?

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.625
Where have I been?
I've been playing mahjong all night.

01:07:50.708 --> 01:07:52.791
-What do you think?
-You were playing mahjong all night?

01:07:52.875 --> 01:07:54.166
We've played 16 rounds already.

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.208
Is something wrong with your husband?

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:58.625
Of course.

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:02.208
Why are you dressed that way?
Where have you been?

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.000
What is this?

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.500
It's blood!

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:09.916
Did you kill someone?

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.458
What's wrong with you?

01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:24.708
We're husband and wife.
Can't I joke with you?

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:27.208
The day after tomorrow
will be our seventh anniversary.

01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:28.791
I want to throw a party to celebrate.

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.250
Okay?

01:08:30.916 --> 01:08:34.125
Gosh, you're still mad.

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:35.791
Let me give you a kiss.

01:09:01.958 --> 01:09:03.083
You scared me.

01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:05.916
Officer Lai, help yourself.

01:09:20.458 --> 01:09:21.875
Do you know Tailor Lam was killed?

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:24.250
I do.

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:25.916
Do you know that I'm going to die soon?

01:09:26.291 --> 01:09:27.375
I do.

01:09:27.541 --> 01:09:29.708
If you can't find the murderer,
you'll die soon too.

01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.500
I am 90 percent sure who the murderer is.

01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:33.958
Who exactly is it?

01:09:34.125 --> 01:09:34.958
Don't be anxious.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.333
My seventh sense tells me
that we will get the answer tonight.

01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:43.625
The real murderer
will reveal his evil side tonight.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.375
Don't move! Hands on your head!

01:09:53.041 --> 01:09:54.291
It's you?

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:56.916
Mr. Wong, I want to tell you something.

01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:00.791
I know what to do.

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:02.958
Excuse me, everyone. Please go over there.

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.791
Thank you for your cooperation. I'm sorry.

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.041
Please go over there.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:08.416
They left. You may speak now.

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:10.625
I wanted you to leave.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:15.291
You should have told me earlier.
I have my pride.

01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:21.541
Mr. Wong, take care of Judy.

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:22.875
What's up with Judy?

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:25.541
It has nothing to do with her.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:26.833
Speak clearly.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.541
I don't have a choice but to tell you now.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:30.166
Actually, she...

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:31.875
What? Be frank, tell me!

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.416
Yes, be frank and speak up.

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:39.375
I love this song. Dance with me, come on.

01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:49.000
Mr. Wong.

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:03.041
We throw a party every year,
but I am the happiest this year.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:04.583
How about you?

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:08.083
That's great, as long as you're happy.

01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:10.916
Why does it seem like
you're not very happy?

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:13.333
What do you think?

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:19.791
Everyone does things for a reason.

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:25.083
But I think there's karma for everything

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:27.208
that everyone has done.

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:34.125
Then what's the reason
for killing someone?

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.958
Tell me, Judy!

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:51.333
Why aren't you talking?

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:53.916
Nothing.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.791
I am thinking that it would be great

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:58.583
if you really were Million Wong.

01:11:59.541 --> 01:12:00.833
You know I am an impostor?

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:04.375
I knew the first day I met you.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.458
You haven't answered my question.

01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:10.166
Don't make me dislike you.

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:15.833
Million and I weren't happy
in recent years.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.000
The past few days,

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:22.458
you helped me remember
the sweet memory of our love.

01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:26.125
We were poor back then.

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:28.333
But our love was true.

01:12:29.416 --> 01:12:31.291
But after he got rich,

01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:34.083
he fooled around.

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.708
And I...

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.083
became more and more perverted.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:42.041
I hate being a woman.

01:12:43.208 --> 01:12:44.541
I want to be a man.

01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:47.583
A man who can compete with him for women.

01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:51.541
But after you came here,

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:54.416
you made me feel like a woman again.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.458
I don't want to know who you are.

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.916
I was just wondering...

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.041
if you can play your role
wholeheartedly tonight.

01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:17.208
Honey.

01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:23.250
I want you to be with me tonight.

01:13:24.958 --> 01:13:26.291
Okay?

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:56.791
I'll touch up my makeup first.

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:19.000
You didn't finish talking earlier.
Who do you suspect is the murderer?

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:20.916
I suspect it's Judy.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:22.333
How come?

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.666
Actually, I was present
when Tailor was killed.

01:14:24.916 --> 01:14:26.125
I followed Judy there.

01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:29.375
Although I didn't witness her kill him,
no one else was around.

01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:30.916
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:33.375
-Tell me.
-I don't know the reason.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:34.583
Are you kidding me?

01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:35.791
Wait, listen to me.

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:38.250
Even if Judy killed someone,
I'm sure she had a reason.

01:14:38.416 --> 01:14:40.500
What reason? She murdered someone!

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:41.833
You are a cop.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.083
-Don't really take her as your wife!
-Mr. Wong!

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.291
-Long time no see.
-Good morning.

01:14:46.375 --> 01:14:47.250
I won't bother you.

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:52.125
Tell me what else you know.

01:14:53.416 --> 01:14:54.750
I think she'll kill again.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:55.958
What?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.708
Kill those who know her secret.

01:14:58.791 --> 01:15:00.416
-Good thing I don't know it.
-Now you do.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.416
I know it too.

01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:03.166
Another person knows. Ms. Cheng!

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.916
Go and inform her.
I will set up traps to arrest her.

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:07.041
Go!

01:15:17.041 --> 01:15:18.041
It's me.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.708
-You scared me.
-Don't be like this.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.916
I have the most wonderful idea.
With this human skin mask,

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:23.958
the murderer will faint once he sees me.

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:25.458
Then I will arrest him right away.

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:27.375
I'll put on the mask first.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:30.041
Hello!

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:33.541
-What's wrong?
-You scared everyone!

01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.083
They read the newspapers, you idiot!

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:36.416
What should we do now?

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:38.875
Go to Judy's room and monitor her.
I'm sure you'll find something.

01:15:38.958 --> 01:15:39.791
I will?

01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:41.208
Where is my gun?

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:43.250
It's dangerous.
You want me to return your gun?

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.708
-Do you really think I'm an idiot?
-Hey.

01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:51.708
We must avenge Tailor tonight.

01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:54.916
He was obviously killed
by Million Wong and his wife.

01:15:55.416 --> 01:15:57.833
You two should be careful.

01:15:58.541 --> 01:15:59.500
Don't worry.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:04.541
Please come in.

01:16:04.833 --> 01:16:05.666
Please come in.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.416
So you have another boyfriend.

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.625
-Don't come to see me again.
-It's a misunderstanding.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:53.541
Maybe this is a new dance move.

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:54.708
Let's follow him.

01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:00.541
Miss, can we dance?

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:06.833
Come here.

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:09.000
Ms. Cheng, you're in danger.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.708
What? It's you again, pervert.

01:17:12.916 --> 01:17:14.666
I changed so many jobs because of you.

01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:16.625
I can't even escape from you
at this party!

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:19.458
This is fate!

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.500
-Come and rape me.
-It's a misunderstanding.

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:23.666
Wait. Come on.

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:25.625
Just once and never bother me again.

01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:27.583
Come and rape me!

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:34.083
The victim died so horribly!

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:36.583
-Right.
-Isn't it a heart attack?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.083
-What is it?
-A person was shot by an arrow.

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:43.583
That's him.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:45.708
Don't move. The cops are coming.

01:17:47.208 --> 01:17:48.625
I monitored Judy Tong upstairs earlier.

01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:50.000
She hasn't left her room.

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:56.208
We were set up.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.416
I don't want to be controlled.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.000
I know what I'm doing.

01:18:16.416 --> 01:18:18.208
Judy, this won't do you any good.

01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:20.125
-Don't ruin my plans.
-Judy!

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.625
Scram. I don't want
to see you again tonight.

01:18:35.041 --> 01:18:36.000
It's you?

01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:39.916
I found a weapon
and wanted to show it to you.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.458
Must you hit me so hard?

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:49.166
Freeze!

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:56.708
-Judy.
-Don't do it!

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:58.958
I know you are the murderer.

01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:02.625
Yes, I killed them all.

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:10.625
Here's your gun.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:12.666
Good job, you'll be promoted.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:14.333
-Promoted to what?
-What do you think?

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.208
Let's calculate my salary first.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.583
-Fine, go ahead.
-Let's go.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.333
-Give way, please.
-Give way, please.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:35.166
I'm leaving, honey.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:22.875
What are you doing?

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.750
You don't know what happened earlier.

01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:29.625
What happened?

01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:32.041
Do you know that the murderer
has been arrested?

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.666
Really? Who is the murderer?

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:36.375
-It turns out the murderer is--
-Judy, right?

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:38.500
She flirted with you
before she was taken away.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:40.708
She even kissed your left armpit.

01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:42.666
How did I know? My cousin told me.

01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:46.208
That's totally wrong.

01:20:47.666 --> 01:20:48.833
Totally wrong!

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:51.208
-Do you dare to deny it?
-I don't.

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.833
But she didn't kiss my left armpit.

01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:54.083
Where did she kiss you then?

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:59.750
Man, trust me. I only love you.

01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02.500
I am willing to take
any punishment from you.

01:21:02.833 --> 01:21:04.125
Come on, punish me.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.458
Who has the time to punish you?

01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:10.125
Then I will punish you.

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:17.541
-You are so bad.
-You're hitting me?

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:22.708
Come on.

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.583
Where did you get this from?

01:21:32.666 --> 01:21:34.375
You told me to punish you.

01:21:34.708 --> 01:21:36.125
Can't I?

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:53.291
Are you scared?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.750
I'm really scared.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.125
Do you dare to let others kiss you again?

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:00.625
Do you?

01:22:09.041 --> 01:22:11.250
Untie me first.

01:22:12.041 --> 01:22:13.125
Hey.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:21.166
-What are you doing?
-Taking a shower.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:41.375
Let's not waste any time.

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:46.208
Honey, come over quickly.

01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:50.208
It's stuck.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.041
Punish me.

01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:03.625
What? It's you?

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:04.958
You are too nosy!

01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:07.208
Man!

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:08.500
You dragged Judy down.

01:23:09.541 --> 01:23:10.916
What? Say that again.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.458
I want to take revenge for Judy!

01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:15.125
I can't hear clearly.
Say that again. What revenge?

01:23:15.208 --> 01:23:17.250
I said I want to take revenge for Judy.

01:23:17.333 --> 01:23:18.875
I can't hear clearly. Can you repeat that?

01:23:18.958 --> 01:23:20.166
Are you making fun of me?

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:28.833
You want to peep?

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:31.750
Dragon Tail Swing!

01:23:31.833 --> 01:23:33.458
-Swing all you want!
-Don't!

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:38.083
I'm going to crush you!

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:53.250
Damn it, you poked me so many times.

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:55.208
Are you serious? Damn you!

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.583
I didn't poke you. I stabbed you!

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.666
What are you looking at?

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.541
I'm going to kill you!

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.291
No way.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.375
That has nothing to do with me.

01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:18.333
I know!

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.250
Are you done?

01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:36.083
It's my turn now.

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.000
Not exactly!

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.250
Thank you.

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:03.291
You think I am useless.

01:25:05.916 --> 01:25:07.750
I am having cramps.

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:14.666
These are the pictures Tailor Lam took
of Judy Tong and Cheng Man-ching.

01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:24.833
Cheng Man-ching is not only a lesbian.

01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:26.541
She is psychotic too.

01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:28.416
She has a strong inclination to violence.

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:30.750
She wants to kill everyone who loves Judy

01:25:30.916 --> 01:25:32.625
and everyone who harms Judy.

01:25:32.958 --> 01:25:34.333
So she killed Million Wong first.

01:25:34.666 --> 01:25:35.791
Then she killed Tailor.

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:38.083
Judy made a statement
about what happened that night.

01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:41.500
You can't fall for that fake Million Wong!

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:43.125
I don't want to be controlled.

01:25:43.333 --> 01:25:44.500
I know what I'm doing.

01:25:44.583 --> 01:25:46.083
That fake Million Wong should die...

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:49.458
so that you and I
can have a bright future.

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:50.958
You are crazy.

01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:52.250
I'm crazy?

01:25:52.875 --> 01:25:54.375
You've had a change of heart.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.166
Million beat you up.

01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:58.250
I took revenge for you, so I killed him.

01:25:58.875 --> 01:26:01.125
-You killed Million?
-So what?

01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:03.250
I killed Tailor too.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.250
You think I don't know.

01:26:05.416 --> 01:26:07.833
He took our naked pictures
to blackmail you.

01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:11.375
Such rubbish needs to be killed,
so that we won't be threatened.

01:26:12.958 --> 01:26:14.708
So it was you all along.

01:26:15.916 --> 01:26:16.875
Why?

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:19.583
I did everything for your sake.

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:22.666
I'm going to kill him now.

01:26:24.541 --> 01:26:25.916
I won't let you do so.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.666
Did you fall for that man?

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:28.791
Get lost!

01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:31.125
No!

01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:37.041
That's why she wanted
to kill me that night too.

01:26:38.541 --> 01:26:41.125
Cheng Man-ching was the one
who wanted to shoot me with an arrow?

01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:47.416
Why would Judy protect Cheng Man-ching?

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.500
She has a deep affection for her.

01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.125
So she acted on impulse
and took all the blame.

01:26:54.541 --> 01:26:55.791
She is really...

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:59.083
Really what?
It's none of your business, right?

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:00.125
Yes.

01:27:00.291 --> 01:27:01.166
That's good.

01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:02.500
You have done a great job.

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:04.166
You have another undercover case.

01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:06.083
-What?
-Are you kidding me?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.041
An order?

01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:10.375
You...

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.416
Be polite, call me Commandant Lek.

01:27:12.625 --> 01:27:15.083
ICAC admitted their mistake
and withdrew their charges against me.

01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:16.375
I have resumed duty now.

01:27:16.625 --> 01:27:17.750
Is that true?

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.250
Of course.

01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:20.708
What's the big deal?

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:23.291
-You have the same rank as me.
-You are wrong.

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:25.208
The boss said that
you always beat people up.

01:27:25.416 --> 01:27:26.875
You are suspended now.

01:27:27.125 --> 01:27:29.916
So I don't need to wait until 1997
before I deal with you.

01:27:30.125 --> 01:27:32.125
-You dare to hit me?
-So what?

01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:33.916
No! Stop!

01:27:34.083 --> 01:27:37.583
-What are you doing? Let me go.
-Stop! Hey!

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:40.500
Don't stop them. Just let them be.

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:42.083
Chow Sing-sing,
someone is looking for you.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:00.583
Hey, Big Mouth.

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:05.416
It's you, Big Nose. Are you all right?

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.916
Why wouldn't I be?
We are having a party tonight.

01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:10.166
I've invited many girls.

01:28:12.416 --> 01:28:13.625
Why are you still standing there?

01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:15.958
-Go and invite some boys.
-Yes, hurry up.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.291
Okay, I'll make it next time.

01:28:18.541 --> 01:28:20.458
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Okay!

01:28:23.875 --> 01:28:25.791
Wait for me!
