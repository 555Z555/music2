00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:10.942
100 years ago,

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.808
this island in Taiwan...

00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:16.043
had nothing

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.010
Only romance

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:23.344
Legend has it

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:25.370
There were two lovers

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:27.344
And one day

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.668
The man was fishing

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.111
His boat sank

00:01:34.912 --> 00:01:36.207
The woman...

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:38.836
saw it onshore

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.009
She swam out

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:45.373
No one ever saw them again

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:46.904
Some say

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.108
they became dolphins

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.838
All dolphins around this island...

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:58.942
came from them

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:09.964
They all make...

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.799
"Bu... Bu" noises

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:28.531
Nice story?

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:35.566
So snooty

00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:40.025
You told a horror story

00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:44.367
Don't get involved

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.902
Have some melon

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:49.463
No

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.492
You're like...

00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:52.100
those dolphins

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.757
So picky

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.126
You named me Bu

00:02:56.535 --> 00:03:01.160
I've told you so often

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.796
Don't mix Mandarin...

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:05.126
with Cantonese

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.595
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:09.823
are now both accented

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:15.823
You teach her Mandarin then

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.826
Get off my case

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.625
That's Cantonese again

00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:24.795
Which I don't speak

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.490
What did you say?

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:31.225
Tell me

00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:36.522
Skipper Restaurant

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.224
Open bar, folks

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.549
One more round

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.985
Drink up

00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:13.555
Go in and take a seat

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:17.055
Long time no see

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:25.148
One more round?

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:26.914
Not tonight

00:04:27.224 --> 00:04:28.712
Can't afford it

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:31.488
On the house

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.677
Bu, 6 beers, on me

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.314
They come everyday

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.454
Never pay

00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:41.050
Add water...

00:04:41.222 --> 00:04:42.449
to the beer

00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:45.552
That trick again?

00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:47.377
Bu Yes?

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:48.951
Hurry

00:04:49.487 --> 00:04:50.884
Here

00:04:51.054 --> 00:04:52.747
Did you add water?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.943
No!

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.946
No, very good

00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:57.419
C'mon

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:01.109
Cheers

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:12.450
Why, Bu?

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:15.440
Idiot

00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:18.410
You could've spared me

00:05:22.116 --> 00:05:23.445
They sing

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.806
Watch TV

00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:28.512
Or pick fights

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:30.844
This island

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:32.605
Has no room...

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:34.036
for romance

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.642
Done

00:05:57.545 --> 00:05:58.476
Beautiful

00:05:58.645 --> 00:05:59.338
I learned it...

00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:00.909
from a magazine

00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.808
Bu

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.236
I brought you something

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:15.464
I've never seen...

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.708
an oyster this big

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:21.499
Any pearls?

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:23.175
No

00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:29.106
Must be expensive

00:06:29.508 --> 00:06:30.599
NT$3,000

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:34.869
Thanks

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.404
And this

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.603
It's my friend's shop

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:42.997
He'll give us a discount

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.865
I'm...

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.396
Proposing?

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.264
No, I just want to...

00:06:50.438 --> 00:06:51.699
Yes, I'm proposing

00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:54.895
With...

00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:56.900
a big oyster?

00:06:57.205 --> 00:06:58.228
Of course not

00:06:58.404 --> 00:06:59.700
The oyster's not...

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.331
Marry me

00:07:04.837 --> 00:07:05.598
Okay

00:07:08.203 --> 00:07:09.362
I'll consider it

00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:25.193
Poor Longyi

00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:26.797
This oyster's not cheap

00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:30.626
He proposed to me

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:32.959
Really?

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.090
You love him?

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:38.995
Well, he's actually...

00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:40.992
Not bad

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.160
Your answer

00:07:43.332 --> 00:07:44.729
Shouldn't be over 4 words

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.488
You love him, or you don't

00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:03.685
You left Hong Kong...

00:08:03.863 --> 00:08:05.123
to marry dad, why?

00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:07.650
He was quite a hunk

00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:10.717
A good cook too

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:13.451
You're a good cook

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:15.053
He's better

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.290
He cooks with love

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.022
What's loving someone like?

00:08:28.393 --> 00:08:31.586
You miss him

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:35.185
The sight of him thrills you

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.816
You ache

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:39.324
When he's gone

00:08:43.925 --> 00:08:45.185
You could watch him forever

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:47.381
Even when he's sleeping

00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.379
You're in love

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.921
If you feel like that

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:54.618
Okay?

00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:10.776
You miss Hong Kong?

00:09:11.154 --> 00:09:14.551
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:15.747
I see

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.947
You don't love Longyi

00:09:21.187 --> 00:09:22.709
Take mama's advice

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:25.215
Trust your heart

00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:27.981
Do what you have to do

00:09:35.118 --> 00:09:36.277
Bu

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:50.805
Hey, kid

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:53.978
Got some news

00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:56.539
Longyi proposed

00:09:58.182 --> 00:09:59.408
Don't laugh

00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:05.244
Somebody said

00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:10.545
Men and women...

00:10:11.647 --> 00:10:12.907
exist in pairs

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:17.241
Till separated on earth

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:21.968
Then they go through life

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:25.110
Searching for one another

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:28.369
Bu

00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:30.541
Where are you going?

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.942
Bu!

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.962
I'm waiting for you!

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.436
Hong Kong, Albert?

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:08.762
How romantic!

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:05.787
You're telling me something?

00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:09.461
You choose for me

00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:07.148
You just decided my future

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:13.216
Excuse me

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.083
You know a good cafe?

00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:18.955
Sure, we'll go together

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:20.279
Thanks

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:31.049
Typical Taiwanese!

00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.248
Pardon me?

00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:35.286
You speak Cantonese?

00:13:35.487 --> 00:13:36.384
Surprised?

00:13:47.186 --> 00:13:48.811
Never flown before?

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:49.780
It shows?

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:51.413
Yes

00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:55.642
You can get lost in Hong Kong

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:57.575
I'll show you around

00:13:58.051 --> 00:13:59.346
I know...

00:13:59.718 --> 00:14:00.876
all the trendy spots

00:14:01.351 --> 00:14:03.374
I have fans everywhere

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.016
I'm a fun guy

00:14:05.517 --> 00:14:06.380
Okay?

00:14:16.182 --> 00:14:17.011
What?

00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:18.573
Are you twins?

00:14:21.848 --> 00:14:22.779
Please forgive me

00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:25.777
Excuse me

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:28.980
Gangster's girlfriend

00:14:29.148 --> 00:14:30.841
disappears

00:15:00.877 --> 00:15:03.240
Morning, sir, working out?

00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:05.775
No time

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.938
Bill, are you ready?

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.469
Good

00:15:28.507 --> 00:15:30.631
Let's start

00:15:34.606 --> 00:15:35.594
Morning, Mr. Chan

00:15:36.072 --> 00:15:38.334
Any news from Wall Street?

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:39.368
Lion Fund...

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:42.402
is borrowing heavily

00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:44.898
Even at...

00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:46.764
a 20% interbank rate

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.561
Check the following

00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:54.230
How many Nikkei Futures...

00:15:54.403 --> 00:15:56.130
did they short?

00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:59.130
Is Yen...

00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:00.927
appreciating?

00:16:01.668 --> 00:16:04.100
Is the lease for the US base...

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:05.393
in Japan expiring?

00:16:05.568 --> 00:16:08.261
If both answer are affirmative

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:09.898
Buy whatever they sell

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.395
But this hedge fund

00:16:11.567 --> 00:16:13.692
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:16.390
Should be invincible

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.957
They're too greedy

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.925
on margin trading

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:22.062
Leveraging 10 times their worth

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:23.324
They're doomed

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.822
So go ahead

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:25.965
Yes, Mr. Chan

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:26.891
Thank you

00:16:34.664 --> 00:16:36.289
Send this with 100 roses...

00:16:36.464 --> 00:16:38.054
to Carman

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.020
During office hours

00:16:41.097 --> 00:16:42.562
Didn't you break up?

00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:44.428
We're still friends

00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:49.521
Find someone and

00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:52.560
settle down

00:16:52.996 --> 00:16:53.757
Like who?

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:56.384
Those women around you

00:16:57.795 --> 00:17:00.955
All so beautiful and elegant

00:17:01.528 --> 00:17:03.016
Too elegant for me

00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:05.654
What do you want?

00:17:06.961 --> 00:17:08.052
Someone amusing

00:18:10.719 --> 00:18:12.651
Make yourself at home

00:18:16.018 --> 00:18:18.609
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

00:18:21.384 --> 00:18:22.611
And you came...

00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:24.749
all that way

00:18:25.784 --> 00:18:27.773
How brave and romantic

00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:34.174
However...

00:18:34.783 --> 00:18:35.806
What?

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.447
I...

00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:40.480
What?

00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:48.971
I'm gay

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:54.607
No

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:55.941
Yes

00:18:56.114 --> 00:18:56.841
Really?

00:18:57.214 --> 00:18:58.009
Really

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.139
No

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.102
Yes

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:00.802
Honest?

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:01.570
Honest

00:19:04.679 --> 00:19:07.201
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:08.940
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:09.112 --> 00:19:09.578
What?

00:19:09.746 --> 00:19:10.643
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:13.135
Such a waste

00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:14.809
Why?

00:19:15.177 --> 00:19:17.302
You're a hunk

00:19:17.478 --> 00:19:19.034
I'm not

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.474
That's stunning

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:34.998
That's what inspired you

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.265
I moved here because of it

00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:45.170
Find a motel tonight

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.006
Fly home tomorrow

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:50.396
I've never traveled

00:19:50.574 --> 00:19:52.267
This is a first

00:19:52.439 --> 00:19:53.769
Think I'll stay a while

00:19:54.573 --> 00:19:55.698
But Hong Kong...

00:19:56.206 --> 00:19:57.263
is boring

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.163
Fly back tomorrow

00:19:59.605 --> 00:20:01.400
My friend said

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:02.896
Hong Kong's fun

00:20:03.939 --> 00:20:06.665
Great restaurants too

00:20:07.171 --> 00:20:09.602
I'll find you...

00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:10.668
a motel

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:13.567
I can't afford one

00:20:13.803 --> 00:20:14.565
Hands off Wait

00:20:16.037 --> 00:20:17.969
Let me stay here

00:20:18.137 --> 00:20:19.693
Women can't stay here

00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:21.925
I'll go nuts

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:24.933
Please

00:20:25.103 --> 00:20:26.932
Sorry Please

00:20:31.968 --> 00:20:35.491
I came all this way

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.431
To such a big let down

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:42.258
I don't deserve this

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:46.821
Goodbye

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:53.497
Bu

00:20:53.666 --> 00:20:54.029
What?

00:20:54.199 --> 00:20:54.994
Your suitcase

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:18.054
Your bag

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:23.020
I can't stand crying

00:21:23.894 --> 00:21:25.326
Makes me feel so guilty

00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:26.852
Okay, stay

00:21:27.195 --> 00:21:30.160
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.655
I'm a makeup artist

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:36.255
Best...

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:38.717
in Hong Kong

00:21:49.925 --> 00:21:50.482
Exquisite

00:21:54.457 --> 00:21:55.047
That's it

00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:18.012
Hold that

00:22:21.054 --> 00:22:21.849
Good

00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:41.312
I'm starving

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:42.508
We'll wrap soon

00:22:43.084 --> 00:22:44.482
How much longer?

00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:46.541
6 hours

00:22:47.617 --> 00:22:49.139
What?

00:22:49.384 --> 00:22:52.316
Keep that door shut

00:22:52.817 --> 00:22:54.340
We're reloading

00:22:54.683 --> 00:22:56.239
You'll fog the film

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:36.304
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

00:23:36.678 --> 00:23:38.610
No... no emergency

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:41.502
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.974
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:49.107
Tell me, what's going on?

00:23:54.009 --> 00:23:55.202
Maybe you'd better go

00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:22.102
C.N. You're cruising and

00:24:22.273 --> 00:24:23.533
didn't invite me?

00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:26.171
Why bother, here you are

00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:28.129
The press says you're romancing my girl

00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:29.795
You believe them?

00:24:30.205 --> 00:24:31.397
Grow up, LW

00:24:33.704 --> 00:24:35.363
Is it true?

00:24:36.104 --> 00:24:36.626
Yes

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.627
We've been competing since grade school

00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:53.464
You've been interested in...

00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:54.566
our stock lately

00:24:54.835 --> 00:24:56.232
I'm interested in all stocks,

00:24:56.401 --> 00:24:57.492
not just yours

00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:00.098
My associates and I

00:25:00.434 --> 00:25:03.025
Hold a majority of the shares

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.857
You can't touch my company

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:06.825
We'll see

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.959
You're on my yacht

00:25:11.299 --> 00:25:12.595
Dating my girl

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.265
And you talk to me like this

00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:17.560
Why did you want me here?

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:21.631
For an apology

00:25:23.697 --> 00:25:25.458
To make it easier on you

00:25:25.697 --> 00:25:27.424
I'm leaving now

00:25:27.898 --> 00:25:29.863
Call me...

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.893
to apologize in...

00:25:32.897 --> 00:25:33.658
5 minutes

00:25:35.863 --> 00:25:36.886
What time is it?

00:25:38.463 --> 00:25:39.587
5:30

00:25:40.829 --> 00:25:41.920
Why wear...

00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:42.823
a watch

00:25:43.062 --> 00:25:44.084
That can't tell time

00:25:44.629 --> 00:25:46.322
I like the diamonds

00:25:48.228 --> 00:25:49.091
Watch him

00:25:50.694 --> 00:25:51.989
If he doesn't call me in five

00:25:52.528 --> 00:25:53.857
Throw him overboard

00:25:55.261 --> 00:25:56.658
But give him a buoy

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:57.553
Yes, boss

00:25:58.226 --> 00:25:58.749
Call me

00:26:11.758 --> 00:26:12.689
Bye, boss

00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:16.886
Call him

00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:18.312
Or you'll get wet

00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:20.252
Make it snappy

00:26:20.423 --> 00:26:22.855
I've got a hot date

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.881
Don't force us to do it

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.083
Get a buoy

00:26:27.257 --> 00:26:27.984
Right

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:29.380
Come

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.614
Hands off

00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:31.445
Easy

00:26:37.855 --> 00:26:38.843
Almost

00:26:45.587 --> 00:26:46.110
Bye

00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:47.612
Here comes the buoy

00:26:47.788 --> 00:26:48.481
It's Fatty

00:26:50.087 --> 00:26:51.417
Fatty fell over

00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:57.177
Don't go

00:27:04.752 --> 00:27:05.581
Help him up

00:27:05.785 --> 00:27:06.716
Over there

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.775
Scared me

00:27:54.812 --> 00:27:55.903
You okay?

00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:56.803
I'm fine

00:28:11.943 --> 00:28:12.670
Call you

00:28:22.975 --> 00:28:23.703
Where is he?

00:28:34.507 --> 00:28:36.064
Where is he?

00:28:36.774 --> 00:28:37.467
You okay?

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.037
Don't fall over again

00:28:43.106 --> 00:28:44.969
You! He's here!

00:28:47.172 --> 00:28:47.933
In the rear

00:28:48.738 --> 00:28:50.068
Help...

00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:53.432
Hold tight

00:28:54.138 --> 00:28:55.399
Close

00:28:59.238 --> 00:29:00.225
You see him?

00:29:00.971 --> 00:29:01.527
No

00:29:01.871 --> 00:29:02.336
Look again

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.027
Over there

00:29:37.532 --> 00:29:38.828
He got away

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:39.623
Wait

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:41.589
The boss wanted him...

00:29:41.766 --> 00:29:43.595
overboard with a buoy

00:29:43.831 --> 00:29:44.956
Job's done, right?

00:29:45.232 --> 00:29:46.129
Right

00:29:46.397 --> 00:29:47.886
It's a wrap

00:30:17.094 --> 00:30:18.082
Thanks

00:30:18.927 --> 00:30:19.722
You okay?

00:30:21.993 --> 00:30:23.619
You're...

00:30:24.626 --> 00:30:25.388
Name's Bu

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.316
Bu?

00:30:29.292 --> 00:30:30.121
You a refugee?

00:30:31.658 --> 00:30:32.749
Yes

00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:34.947
From Vietnam?

00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:37.748
Right again

00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:40.121
How many of you?

00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:41.782
Just me, why?

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:44.213
Who's driving?

00:30:57.956 --> 00:30:58.853
Give me a hand

00:30:59.388 --> 00:31:03.615
I can't, I'm starving

00:31:04.388 --> 00:31:05.410
Aren't you?

00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:09.181
No, but I could use a snack

00:31:17.587 --> 00:31:21.848
Let's talk

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:23.007
so I forget the hunger

00:31:23.853 --> 00:31:24.580
About what?

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:29.284
What do you like?

00:31:31.985 --> 00:31:33.973
Nothing?

00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:36.847
Not even cars and women?

00:31:39.617 --> 00:31:42.174
Don't just smile

00:31:42.816 --> 00:31:44.873
Okay, what don't you like?

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.912
Nosy people

00:32:01.948 --> 00:32:03.277
What don't you like?

00:32:06.447 --> 00:32:10.344
Growing up,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.507
I like being naughty

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.441
Nosy?

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:15.977
Naughty

00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:17.173
Naughty

00:32:17.378 --> 00:32:18.173
And no one...

00:32:18.812 --> 00:32:21.300
pampers you anymore

00:32:21.778 --> 00:32:22.540
What do you like?

00:32:24.878 --> 00:32:26.844
A shower when I'm sweaty

00:32:27.811 --> 00:32:28.969
Snap out of bed...

00:32:29.377 --> 00:32:31.002
to a cup of coffee

00:32:34.777 --> 00:32:36.106
I'd like one now

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:41.502
Hong Kong stars are lovely

00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:43.931
Stars are...

00:32:44.576 --> 00:32:46.666
the same everywhere

00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:49.637
If you care to look at them

00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:55.298
What?

00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:56.907
Shooting star!

00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:58.335
Really?

00:32:58.507 --> 00:33:01.234
Mom said when you see one

00:33:01.407 --> 00:33:03.838
Touch your pocket and make a wish

00:33:04.006 --> 00:33:04.903
And it'll come true

00:33:05.339 --> 00:33:06.896
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

00:33:08.673 --> 00:33:10.002
Another one

00:33:21.304 --> 00:33:22.429
What's your wish?

00:33:23.404 --> 00:33:25.427
Can't tell you

00:33:31.303 --> 00:33:33.098
Or it won't come true

00:33:36.836 --> 00:33:37.767
I'm so sleepy

00:34:31.662 --> 00:34:32.889
A boat! Help!

00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:41.683
Over here!

00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:21.250
The Silicon Valley stocks?

00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:26.320
They'll go even higher

00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:32.314
Check one thing

00:35:33.188 --> 00:35:34.847
Does LW control...

00:35:35.253 --> 00:35:36.049
his company's shares?

00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:56.509
Buy me a new mobile

00:35:58.151 --> 00:35:59.117
It drowned

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.481
There's no transport...

00:36:11.649 --> 00:36:13.138
around here

00:36:13.316 --> 00:36:14.645
I'll give you a ride

00:36:15.515 --> 00:36:18.242
Just tell me where I am

00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:19.506
and I'll walk back

00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:21.510
We're out

00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:24.306
in the boonies, Miss

00:36:24.748 --> 00:36:25.805
Name's Bu

00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:28.137
Boo? Bu!

00:36:28.314 --> 00:36:29.870
Just get in

00:36:30.081 --> 00:36:30.637
Sure

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.743
Not you, this lady here

00:36:36.979 --> 00:36:39.706
There are only 2 seats

00:36:40.279 --> 00:36:41.040
I know

00:36:41.546 --> 00:36:42.909
Here's 20 bucks

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:45.670
Around the corner...

00:36:45.845 --> 00:36:47.606
are buses and cabs

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.964
Compulsive liar

00:37:17.374 --> 00:37:18.170
Come in

00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:22.606
Huge place, you live alone?

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.863
There's a butler

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.430
Must get crowded

00:37:28.406 --> 00:37:29.429
Wait here

00:37:29.707 --> 00:37:30.536
Can I look around?

00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:31.502
Help yourself

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:32.262
Thanks

00:37:47.237 --> 00:37:48.066
I'm starving

00:37:54.437 --> 00:37:56.369
Some food please!

00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:37.958
Need something?

00:38:38.831 --> 00:38:40.023
Fish food

00:38:40.464 --> 00:38:42.487
They're electronic fish

00:38:44.396 --> 00:38:46.056
Come over here

00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:47.761
Why electronic fish?

00:38:48.396 --> 00:38:49.884
I never change the water

00:38:50.063 --> 00:38:51.824
Fish never die, it's perfect

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.027
And if the power's out?

00:38:55.995 --> 00:38:58.859
You invite friends over?

00:38:59.395 --> 00:39:00.122
Don't have any

00:39:00.594 --> 00:39:01.457
So boring, and lonely

00:39:14.759 --> 00:39:15.486
Now what?

00:39:17.392 --> 00:39:18.517
You like to fight?

00:39:19.292 --> 00:39:20.519
Some golf,

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.585
some race horses

00:39:23.292 --> 00:39:25.019
I box and work out

00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:27.818
What's the octopus for?

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:29.290
You're so nosy

00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:30.617
Sorry

00:39:38.956 --> 00:39:41.183
This should fit, change in there

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:56.719
Betty, call me a cab

00:39:57.988 --> 00:39:59.214
20 minutes? Great

00:40:27.483 --> 00:40:28.642
There's a room...

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.210
behind the mirror

00:40:33.783 --> 00:40:36.476
How would I have known?

00:40:38.982 --> 00:40:39.505
Hungry?

00:40:40.149 --> 00:40:41.705
Starving

00:40:42.082 --> 00:40:43.241
Me too

00:40:43.948 --> 00:40:46.243
Any Chinese pot rice?

00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:48.071
What?

00:41:01.179 --> 00:41:03.111
Best take out food ever

00:41:03.646 --> 00:41:05.111
My favorite

00:41:06.645 --> 00:41:08.270
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:10.035
I hate the smell

00:41:14.045 --> 00:41:16.272
Don't stare. Eat up

00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:17.573
Sure

00:41:34.808 --> 00:41:35.604
Now what?

00:41:35.975 --> 00:41:37.441
You're amusing when you eat

00:41:43.441 --> 00:41:44.270
Are you rich?

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.635
I guess so

00:41:47.573 --> 00:41:48.334
What do you do?

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.834
I'm into trash

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:51.473
C'mon

00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:52.962
No, I sell trash

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.930
Be that way

00:42:06.238 --> 00:42:08.101
Can I have a soda?

00:42:08.471 --> 00:42:09.595
Juice is better for you

00:42:33.934 --> 00:42:36.900
Bu took the lift down

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.364
What's wrong?

00:43:09.996 --> 00:43:12.518
Stop moaning

00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:16.823
You know

00:43:17.262 --> 00:43:20.853
That bottle's very special

00:43:21.062 --> 00:43:21.959
So special that...

00:43:22.528 --> 00:43:24.187
all of a sudden

00:43:24.361 --> 00:43:26.224
I'm feeding and sheltering you

00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:27.156
Just like that

00:43:27.495 --> 00:43:30.392
Remember I told you about...

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.526
C. N? More than once

00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:34.852
Last night...

00:43:35.027 --> 00:43:37.322
You told me that too

00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:41.724
I think he's... nice

00:43:41.925 --> 00:43:42.652
Nice?

00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:48.518
These magazines are published weekly

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:51.385
And he changes girlfriends just as often

00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:55.423
He's not nice, he's a playboy

00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:56.386
Let's see

00:43:57.157 --> 00:43:58.521
An ex-girlfriend says

00:44:02.923 --> 00:44:06.286
He doesn't say sweet words

00:44:06.756 --> 00:44:09.847
But he's a romantic man

00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:13.612
He appears stem and talks tough

00:44:14.222 --> 00:44:16.279
Inside he's like a kid

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:20.243
He's competitive and chases novelty

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.218
Never regrets any decision

00:44:24.187 --> 00:44:25.118
With him...

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.647
You feel insecure

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.751
Meaning?

00:44:30.286 --> 00:44:32.376
Chases novelty, so he fools around

00:44:32.986 --> 00:44:34.508
No regrets,

00:44:34.853 --> 00:44:36.182
so he enjoys dumping women

00:44:36.419 --> 00:44:38.317
Maybe those women deserved it

00:44:38.585 --> 00:44:39.949
They were insecure...

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:42.641
to begin with

00:44:42.918 --> 00:44:44.042
Spare me

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.674
Hong Kong's boring anyway

00:44:51.484 --> 00:44:52.108
Going home?

00:44:52.584 --> 00:44:55.447
No, C.N. Is fun

00:44:57.316 --> 00:44:59.305
You have to hook him first

00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:00.643
Can't just walk up

00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:02.610
And take off your clothes

00:45:02.915 --> 00:45:04.710
That sure won't work

00:45:04.882 --> 00:45:06.438
But you never know

00:45:06.882 --> 00:45:07.938
He's competitive and

00:45:08.115 --> 00:45:10.240
chases novelty

00:45:10.547 --> 00:45:12.513
I have a plan, I need your help

00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:13.374
No way

00:45:14.247 --> 00:45:15.713
Please

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:17.976
Sorry

00:45:20.713 --> 00:45:21.804
Please tell me

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.809
where your daughter is

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.770
She found a bottle

00:45:25.946 --> 00:45:27.310
She's in Hong Kong

00:45:29.379 --> 00:45:31.641
I have to get Bu back

00:45:32.512 --> 00:45:33.307
Chow Yun Fat!

00:45:34.112 --> 00:45:37.441
Mr. Chow

00:45:39.244 --> 00:45:40.800
Wrong guy

00:45:40.977 --> 00:45:41.943
You speak Mandarin?

00:45:42.311 --> 00:45:44.140
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.970
Don't try to fool me

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.870
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

00:45:48.943 --> 00:45:51.171
Mr. Chow, you're back!

00:45:51.442 --> 00:45:52.567
Fresh form Hollywood?

00:45:52.743 --> 00:45:53.936
Please sign Can I take a picture?

00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:56.632
You mind? OK

00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:00.472
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

00:46:00.642 --> 00:46:03.903
My turn, miss

00:46:04.274 --> 00:46:06.535
Point a gun at me

00:46:06.707 --> 00:46:09.138
Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

00:46:09.974 --> 00:46:12.599
Thank you, Mr. Chow

00:46:13.173 --> 00:46:15.730
Give me a hug

00:46:18.606 --> 00:46:21.003
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

00:46:21.306 --> 00:46:22.601
I'll send you the photos

00:46:22.772 --> 00:46:24.068
Bye You're so sweet

00:46:24.238 --> 00:46:25.100
Same as the photo

00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:26.159
Print me a copy

00:46:28.005 --> 00:46:29.630
He's such a hunk Bye

00:46:29.804 --> 00:46:30.667
Bye

00:46:32.838 --> 00:46:33.633
My bag!

00:46:40.269 --> 00:46:41.667
We checked LW's company

00:46:42.003 --> 00:46:43.162
Last year,

00:46:43.336 --> 00:46:44.665
rumover grew 13%

00:46:44.902 --> 00:46:47.595
Profit: Over HK$1 billion

00:46:47.969 --> 00:46:50.594
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

00:46:51.035 --> 00:46:52.160
We have acquired...

00:46:52.335 --> 00:46:54.527
16% of the company

00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:58.059
LW and his associates...

00:46:58.234 --> 00:47:00.496
still hold 65%

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.857
But...

00:47:03.134 --> 00:47:04.599
they're not selling

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.357
Dump all my stocks

00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:11.296
If we dump them,

00:47:11.466 --> 00:47:12.591
the price will plunge

00:47:12.766 --> 00:47:16.925
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

00:47:17.432 --> 00:47:19.397
Just do it

00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:23.631
I need to see K.K.

00:47:23.931 --> 00:47:24.624
Yes, sir

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:26.326
Who's K. K?

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.291
Head of Environmental Protection

00:48:28.689 --> 00:48:30.655
Going up or down?

00:48:31.123 --> 00:48:33.418
I was seeing friends upstairs

00:48:33.955 --> 00:48:34.784
There's no upstairs

00:48:36.022 --> 00:48:36.817
Really?

00:48:38.222 --> 00:48:41.187
Actually they live downstairs

00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:42.079
Names?

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:44.985
I forgot

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.477
So quiet here

00:48:50.853 --> 00:48:53.285
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

00:48:53.486 --> 00:48:54.975
You messed up my wall

00:48:56.986 --> 00:48:58.009
Excuse me?

00:49:05.585 --> 00:49:07.312
Look!

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.041
Easy there

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:17.743
Let go

00:49:17.917 --> 00:49:18.712
Who sent you?

00:49:19.583 --> 00:49:20.378
Let go first

00:49:22.882 --> 00:49:23.643
Like my writing?

00:49:35.414 --> 00:49:38.039
Enough. I don't know kungfu

00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:39.539
I'm just a messenger

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.404
Message?

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.107
My back pocket

00:49:51.779 --> 00:49:56.370
Bully. You messed up my arm

00:49:56.545 --> 00:49:57.533
Happy reading

00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:00.443
Gangster's girlfriend...

00:50:00.612 --> 00:50:01.202
disappears

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.203
What happened?

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.201
Fell down some stairs

00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:11.035
You okay?

00:50:11.277 --> 00:50:11.640
I'll live

00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:14.267
Will he buy...

00:50:14.443 --> 00:50:15.773
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

00:50:16.009 --> 00:50:17.134
How should I know?

00:50:17.709 --> 00:50:18.834
Will it work?

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.365
Of course

00:50:22.675 --> 00:50:23.698
What's next?

00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:25.965
Showtime

00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:27.504
Where are your pals?

00:50:35.374 --> 00:50:36.930
You know we're bad

00:50:37.107 --> 00:50:38.629
We're here to waste you

00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:40.170
React!

00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:41.999
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

00:50:42.173 --> 00:50:45.627
Is a Taiwanese gangster

00:50:45.806 --> 00:50:47.271
The sworn enemy of our boss

00:50:47.439 --> 00:50:49.462
He wants you defaced

00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:51.536
Frog, your turn

00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.327
Believe it or not

00:50:53.671 --> 00:50:55.500
You're front page news

00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:58.630
Everyone's looking for you now

00:51:01.904 --> 00:51:03.164
Yes. Looking awesome

00:51:29.434 --> 00:51:30.024
You okay?

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.629
Yes, and you?

00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:34.394
It's you!

00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:35.098
You okay?

00:51:35.299 --> 00:51:35.923
Yes

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.396
I don't know these goons

00:51:42.565 --> 00:51:43.155
What?

00:51:43.498 --> 00:51:43.929
Nothing

00:52:15.428 --> 00:52:16.688
You can't be ID'ed

00:52:18.328 --> 00:52:19.816
They're damn good actors

00:53:30.718 --> 00:53:31.877
Back off

00:53:33.651 --> 00:53:34.082
Stay here

00:53:34.251 --> 00:53:36.308
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

00:53:36.617 --> 00:53:37.708
You're bleeding

00:53:39.784 --> 00:53:41.511
We'll spare you today

00:53:41.784 --> 00:53:43.647
Don't provoke him

00:53:44.716 --> 00:53:46.909
Cops will go after them

00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:47.739
Not us

00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:50.915
Hi, there

00:53:51.282 --> 00:53:57.544
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

00:53:58.114 --> 00:53:58.875
Thanks

00:53:59.381 --> 00:54:01.108
Someone reported a fight

00:54:01.281 --> 00:54:02.008
We were attacked

00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:03.371
They leave any evidence?

00:54:03.714 --> 00:54:04.771
Baseball bats

00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:08.442
Sunny, smell

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.170
Any clues?

00:54:22.145 --> 00:54:24.441
Sunny, you're clueless

00:54:25.078 --> 00:54:26.509
Let's get help

00:54:31.544 --> 00:54:33.032
My site, very safe

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:36.169
It's so trashy

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.839
I told you I sell trash

00:54:38.176 --> 00:54:39.801
Expensive stuff too

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.103
Expensive? Trash is trash

00:54:43.842 --> 00:54:45.068
Before you were...

00:54:45.375 --> 00:54:46.432
a Vietnamese refugee

00:54:46.808 --> 00:54:48.035
Now you're...

00:54:48.342 --> 00:54:50.364
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

00:54:50.908 --> 00:54:52.305
So who are you, really?

00:54:52.808 --> 00:54:55.602
A dangerous woman

00:54:55.874 --> 00:54:56.737
Scared?

00:54:57.507 --> 00:54:58.370
Never

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.499
Thrilled to be with me?

00:55:05.906 --> 00:55:08.201
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

00:55:10.005 --> 00:55:12.698
I lived near a police station

00:55:12.972 --> 00:55:15.733
with posters of wanted criminals

00:55:16.338 --> 00:55:20.565
One of them was a hunk

00:55:21.004 --> 00:55:23.492
I saw his poster everyday

00:55:24.137 --> 00:55:26.898
And I fell in love

00:55:27.203 --> 00:55:27.930
And?

00:55:28.803 --> 00:55:32.098
I found him, stole his heart

00:55:33.036 --> 00:55:34.525
How was he?

00:55:35.602 --> 00:55:39.159
Cute, a great dancer

00:55:41.368 --> 00:55:42.856
Really romantic

00:55:44.568 --> 00:55:45.795
For being a dancer?

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.757
You dance?

00:55:49.334 --> 00:55:49.958
Of course

00:55:53.134 --> 00:55:54.031
This?

00:55:56.099 --> 00:55:56.758
Sure

00:55:58.666 --> 00:55:59.825
Tango?

00:56:04.532 --> 00:56:05.293
That too

00:56:06.232 --> 00:56:09.322
So common, nothing more exciting?

00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:11.060
Sure Really?

00:56:11.531 --> 00:56:12.928
Teach me

00:56:14.797 --> 00:56:15.626
You'll be scared

00:56:15.864 --> 00:56:16.761
No way

00:56:19.297 --> 00:56:20.285
Hold me

00:56:20.764 --> 00:56:21.922
Give me your legs

00:56:22.196 --> 00:56:23.127
Right

00:56:24.163 --> 00:56:24.787
Ready?

00:56:27.995 --> 00:56:28.858
Help!

00:56:35.061 --> 00:56:35.652
Exciting enough?

00:56:35.828 --> 00:56:36.316
Yes

00:56:36.928 --> 00:56:37.417
No more?

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:38.485
You aren't scared?

00:56:38.694 --> 00:56:39.353
Never

00:56:39.994 --> 00:56:40.960
More moves?

00:56:44.927 --> 00:56:46.790
Just hold tight and

00:56:46.993 --> 00:56:47.720
stay still

00:56:48.093 --> 00:56:49.184
Enjoy the variations

00:56:49.459 --> 00:56:49.823
Really? Okay?

00:56:49.993 --> 00:56:50.549
Okay...

00:56:50.726 --> 00:56:51.384
There

00:56:52.092 --> 00:56:53.648
Run, 1, 2, 3

00:57:02.658 --> 00:57:05.351
Wow! This is fun

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:09.183
Man's so busy

00:57:09.591 --> 00:57:10.783
Making trash

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.583
The recycling business is a gold mine

00:57:15.189 --> 00:57:15.655
They say...

00:57:15.823 --> 00:57:17.617
What others abandon, I take

00:57:19.123 --> 00:57:20.349
You did well last time

00:57:21.155 --> 00:57:23.678
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:26.554
They all know you're my protégé

00:57:26.821 --> 00:57:27.650
I'm flattered

00:57:27.922 --> 00:57:28.546
Thank you

00:57:29.254 --> 00:57:32.618
Don't thank me, thank yourself

00:57:33.254 --> 00:57:35.651
Any new plans?

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.511
I heard you're buying LW's company

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.542
You know

00:57:43.886 --> 00:57:45.681
what's the best win?

00:57:47.852 --> 00:57:50.511
Winning one's battle...

00:57:51.152 --> 00:57:53.709
with the enemy's respect

00:58:00.784 --> 00:58:01.807
Stock Exchange's closed

00:58:01.984 --> 00:58:02.711
And?

00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:06.673
Our stock dropped 20%

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.975
Closed at $6.50

00:58:11.283 --> 00:58:12.510
Our drop in asset value?

00:58:13.682 --> 00:58:15.511
Over 2 billion

00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:17.947
It's Chan,

00:58:18.115 --> 00:58:19.240
he's dumping our shares

00:58:21.448 --> 00:58:23.310
What's the news on him?

00:58:24.181 --> 00:58:26.442
Rumors are he wants...

00:58:26.648 --> 00:58:27.943
to buy our company

00:58:28.947 --> 00:58:30.572
Then...

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.807
why dump his shares?

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:37.636
After buying them so high?

00:58:39.279 --> 00:58:42.541
What's he up to?

00:58:43.245 --> 00:58:44.040
Boss

00:58:49.378 --> 00:58:50.275
What happened to you?

00:58:50.645 --> 00:58:52.167
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

00:58:52.478 --> 00:58:53.307
Was he hurt?

00:58:53.944 --> 00:58:55.341
Not a scratch

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:56.940
Thank God

00:58:57.377 --> 00:58:58.138
Else...

00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:59.503
I'd blame myself

00:58:59.943 --> 00:59:00.966
And if...

00:59:01.143 --> 00:59:03.506
Well,

00:59:03.676 --> 00:59:04.937
you actually were hurt

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:07.965
And see, I feel guilty

00:59:08.142 --> 00:59:09.698
It was your dad's idea

00:59:11.375 --> 00:59:12.932
He screwed up

00:59:13.441 --> 00:59:15.066
Ordering an ambush

00:59:15.441 --> 00:59:16.963
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

00:59:17.507 --> 00:59:19.735
That's much faster

00:59:20.108 --> 00:59:22.232
Let's do it

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.435
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

00:59:27.773 --> 00:59:29.796
Challenge him openly

00:59:30.906 --> 00:59:32.167
Right

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:36.862
Yes!

00:59:37.938 --> 00:59:40.234
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

00:59:41.471 --> 00:59:42.596
Tougher

00:59:44.005 --> 00:59:45.766
Smaller

00:59:46.937 --> 00:59:47.766
And...

00:59:48.237 --> 00:59:49.634
Handsomer than Chan

00:59:50.037 --> 00:59:52.093
He'll be devastated

01:00:00.602 --> 01:00:01.192
What's that?

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:06.667
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

01:00:07.334 --> 01:00:08.129
Tricky signals

01:00:17.734 --> 01:00:19.495
Have you seen her?

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:22.731
That's Mary

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.990
No, that's Bunny

01:00:25.266 --> 01:00:26.357
No, that's Mary

01:00:26.533 --> 01:00:28.930
That's Bunny, come with me

01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:32.063
No, that way

01:00:32.431 --> 01:00:34.021
No

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.322
Another Bunny?

01:00:37.098 --> 01:00:38.859
A masseuse

01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:40.720
A masseuse?

01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:41.963
Why not?

01:01:03.628 --> 01:01:05.025
Oh my God, what's he doing?

01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:25.787
Albert!

01:01:28.691 --> 01:01:30.384
Do I look pretty?

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:31.886
Yes

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.019
What?

01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:37.322
Your outfit

01:01:37.557 --> 01:01:39.579
My Sunday best

01:01:41.257 --> 01:01:42.779
Go to...

01:01:42.956 --> 01:01:44.148
Jean-Paul's Boutique

01:01:44.322 --> 01:01:45.618
I'll call him,

01:01:45.855 --> 01:01:47.014
let him dress you

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:49.921
You feed, shelter,

01:01:50.089 --> 01:01:51.918
and clothe me

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:52.985
You're my guardian angel

01:01:54.054 --> 01:01:55.111
Your wish is...

01:01:55.421 --> 01:01:57.477
my command

01:01:57.754 --> 01:01:58.344
Bye

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:00.884
What?

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.352
How should I behave at dinner?

01:02:04.486 --> 01:02:06.543
You're playing a gangster's lady

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.083
Use method acting

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:13.242
Teach me

01:02:13.552 --> 01:02:14.449
Just act snooty

01:02:15.418 --> 01:02:17.008
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

01:02:18.751 --> 01:02:20.774
I'm an angel

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:25.443
She forgot something?

01:02:27.516 --> 01:02:28.504
Yes?

01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:31.044
Help!

01:02:31.216 --> 01:02:31.977
It's you!

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:39.047
Where's Bu?

01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:48.139
Please tell me where she is

01:03:00.246 --> 01:03:00.836
Mr. Chan

01:03:01.046 --> 01:03:01.534
Thanks

01:03:06.446 --> 01:03:06.877
Mr. Chan

01:03:26.142 --> 01:03:26.767
What's this?

01:03:27.576 --> 01:03:28.473
Excuse me

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:30.670
The lady's so lovely

01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:33.397
She deserves some wind effect

01:03:35.675 --> 01:03:36.436
You look gorgeous

01:03:36.741 --> 01:03:37.435
I know

01:03:48.339 --> 01:03:49.134
Well?

01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:52.430
A vintage wine, from '82

01:03:58.005 --> 01:04:01.494
But I can also tell

01:04:03.072 --> 01:04:05.469
The grape-picker was born in '60

01:04:08.304 --> 01:04:09.065
Let's order

01:04:13.403 --> 01:04:14.334
You order

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.336
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:22.431
Just kidding

01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:23.764
Thank God!

01:04:28.568 --> 01:04:31.193
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

01:04:33.867 --> 01:04:35.696
We don't want to be crowded

01:04:41.866 --> 01:04:42.763
Excuse me

01:04:44.933 --> 01:04:46.592
You booked the whole place?

01:04:47.932 --> 01:04:49.522
Just you and me

01:04:50.732 --> 01:04:52.254
I was hoping

01:04:52.498 --> 01:04:54.794
To run into celebrities

01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:57.219
You must really...

01:04:57.398 --> 01:04:58.954
hate crowds

01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:00.391
What about your friends?

01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:06.827
Here comes one

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.752
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

01:05:13.562 --> 01:05:16.790
Why'd you do it?

01:05:17.262 --> 01:05:19.989
Dump my company's shares?

01:05:20.195 --> 01:05:20.956
I'm at dinner,

01:05:21.128 --> 01:05:22.116
call me tomorrow

01:05:24.695 --> 01:05:27.354
You're hurting me

01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:29.389
And yourself too

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:32.559
Mr. Lo, please leave

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:33.889
Sir

01:05:34.493 --> 01:05:35.822
You look intelligent

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.584
I am intelligent

01:05:38.126 --> 01:05:40.024
Then stay home and think

01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:41.715
Devise a way...

01:05:41.892 --> 01:05:43.721
to save your company

01:05:45.425 --> 01:05:46.914
Who are you?

01:05:47.391 --> 01:05:48.448
C.N.'s friend

01:05:48.758 --> 01:05:50.724
He booked the whole place for me

01:05:51.358 --> 01:05:53.324
You're disturbing us

01:05:53.757 --> 01:05:55.950
That's so rude

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:01.517
Let's talk outside

01:06:02.823 --> 01:06:03.686
We've talked enough

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:06.485
See you outside

01:06:10.455 --> 01:06:13.852
That signal means "Follow me"

01:06:14.422 --> 01:06:15.410
Wrong again?

01:06:20.721 --> 01:06:21.845
You're snooty

01:06:22.654 --> 01:06:24.482
So are my friends

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.016
it rubs off

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:30.574
You have to go?

01:06:32.886 --> 01:06:35.875
It'll just take a minute

01:06:45.551 --> 01:06:46.346
C.N.

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.775
Watch your back

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:01.309
Watch your back

01:07:02.915 --> 01:07:03.539
I called,

01:07:03.915 --> 01:07:06.608
cleared it with your boss

01:07:07.015 --> 01:07:08.480
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

01:07:08.648 --> 01:07:11.409
Close the parking lot for us

01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:14.739
Relax, I'm footing the bill

01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:15.571
Fine, Mr. Lo

01:07:16.013 --> 01:07:17.445
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

01:07:20.147 --> 01:07:21.806
Have fun, Mr. Chan

01:07:23.713 --> 01:07:24.303
LW

01:07:25.179 --> 01:07:26.042
What's up?

01:07:26.513 --> 01:07:28.206
I want you to meet someone

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.237
I hired him from overseas

01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:32.342
Ladies and gentlemen

01:07:34.178 --> 01:07:35.041
Alan

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:44.065
An undefeated light-weight champion

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.874
He'll fight you one-on-one

01:07:50.676 --> 01:07:51.937
But...

01:07:52.143 --> 01:07:53.506
I'm a middle-weight

01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:55.199
Too much of an edge

01:07:55.442 --> 01:07:58.669
But if you lose

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:02.269
Think of the disgrace

01:08:04.007 --> 01:08:06.564
Grow up

01:08:06.807 --> 01:08:07.830
Nuts

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:09.736
Play this music for me

01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:10.804
No problem

01:09:02.933 --> 01:09:04.364
You have no choice

01:09:06.932 --> 01:09:07.989
Why the gloves?

01:09:08.299 --> 01:09:10.356
This is a boxing match

01:09:10.599 --> 01:09:11.565
I'm not...

01:09:11.766 --> 01:09:12.424
into crippling people

01:09:13.033 --> 01:09:14.623
With gloves, it won't hurt?

01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:17.094
Sure it'll hurt

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:18.958
But much less

01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:24.489
All set

01:09:25.264 --> 01:09:25.922
Watch your head

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:28.989
Music

01:09:29.764 --> 01:09:31.229
Knock me down anyway you can

01:09:32.397 --> 01:09:33.953
But no dirty tricks

01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:39.821
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

01:09:42.828 --> 01:09:46.590
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

01:09:52.128 --> 01:09:53.094
You ask for it

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:55.349
Are you ready?

01:09:55.527 --> 01:09:56.151
Of course

01:10:00.027 --> 01:10:00.720
Alan's losing big time

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.457
No, Alan's just testing him

01:10:03.759 --> 01:10:05.248
He's wearing Chan down

01:10:20.224 --> 01:10:23.519
Wait Good

01:10:32.188 --> 01:10:33.347
Changing gloves, why?

01:10:33.922 --> 01:10:34.887
Even the odds

01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:36.719
Bigger the glove,

01:10:36.955 --> 01:10:38.182
bigger the handicap

01:10:38.588 --> 01:10:41.179
Chan's punches are soft

01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:48.247
I've come a long way,

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.042
I don't want a short game

01:10:53.552 --> 01:10:54.518
Every boxer trains...

01:10:54.853 --> 01:10:55.876
to his own music

01:10:56.053 --> 01:10:56.916
When he fights,

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.779
it give him rhythm

01:10:59.152 --> 01:11:00.811
And rhythm paces his steps

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.710
Chan has no rhythm

01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:09.183
He's controlled by Alan

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:11.314
You're an expert

01:11:11.484 --> 01:11:12.041
You should be fighting

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:13.074
Right

01:11:13.584 --> 01:11:15.311
C.N. And I used to box

01:11:15.517 --> 01:11:16.812
But I always lost

01:11:17.317 --> 01:11:18.509
So I quit and became a...

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:19.741
Commentator

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:20.574
Wow!

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:22.281
You like that better?

01:11:22.815 --> 01:11:25.474
Sure. I sound so invincible

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.113
But I'm just like you guys

01:11:27.615 --> 01:11:29.205
Helpless

01:11:36.948 --> 01:11:39.140
Chan used to have brilliant moves

01:11:39.381 --> 01:11:40.210
Now he's a mess

01:11:41.513 --> 01:11:44.308
Buying companies...

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.241
instead of training

01:11:45.413 --> 01:11:47.402
Loser!

01:12:16.342 --> 01:12:19.570
Chan's nervous, it's over

01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:27.592
Good hit, but not enough power

01:13:46.031 --> 01:13:46.928
Come on

01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:28.313
You okay?

01:14:29.959 --> 01:14:30.925
You win

01:14:33.758 --> 01:14:35.849
We won

01:14:36.192 --> 01:14:38.555
Let's kick him while he's down

01:14:38.858 --> 01:14:39.982
Good idea

01:14:43.857 --> 01:14:45.050
Don't be...

01:14:45.657 --> 01:14:47.486
such cowards

01:14:48.256 --> 01:14:49.619
Ganging up on a downed man

01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:51.721
There's no honor in that

01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.916
You're good

01:15:00.888 --> 01:15:01.512
Get the car

01:15:07.921 --> 01:15:10.216
My joy is done. He's good

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.814
C.N., you okay?

01:15:21.286 --> 01:15:22.945
You must be delighted

01:15:24.452 --> 01:15:27.384
No, but I thought I would be

01:15:31.651 --> 01:15:33.083
You need help?

01:15:37.117 --> 01:15:37.912
Damn it

01:15:43.183 --> 01:15:45.671
C.N., call me

01:16:20.545 --> 01:16:21.272
You didn't leave?

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.243
You asked me to wait

01:16:24.044 --> 01:16:26.407
I came to find you

01:16:28.777 --> 01:16:31.265
Did they gang up on you?

01:16:31.577 --> 01:16:34.633
No, one-on-one, I lost

01:16:36.043 --> 01:16:39.304
You'll get used to it

01:16:41.109 --> 01:16:42.166
Just kidding

01:16:42.976 --> 01:16:46.339
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:51.105
I'll train, but not for them

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:53.567
For what then?

01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:58.463
A strong body, a quick mind

01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:01.600
I haven't trained in ages

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.103
Your huge gym, what a waste

01:17:07.973 --> 01:17:09.268
I hate training alone

01:17:11.972 --> 01:17:13.961
I'll join you

01:17:16.705 --> 01:17:17.693
Why be so nice to me?

01:17:18.937 --> 01:17:20.062
You're rich

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:24.126
You're cute when you smile

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.635
You looked grouchy just now

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.727
That's why you lost

01:17:31.536 --> 01:17:32.900
Stick with smiling

01:17:34.369 --> 01:17:36.926
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

01:17:41.234 --> 01:17:42.700
Take tomorrow off

01:17:42.968 --> 01:17:43.626
Why?

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.261
Say yes first

01:17:45.467 --> 01:17:45.865
Why?

01:17:46.234 --> 01:17:47.358
Say yes first

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.491
Yes, now why?

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:51.627
Play!

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.198
Memories are so many

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.424
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

01:18:01.999 --> 01:18:06.363
I sketch a hazy future

01:18:07.298 --> 01:18:11.696
Knowing this illusion is love

01:18:12.064 --> 01:18:16.360
The tides of a lifetime

01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:21.591
Widen the shores slowly

01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:26.518
Quietly you and I meet

01:18:27.029 --> 01:18:32.120
Our love proves life is ever changing

01:18:33.262 --> 01:18:38.421
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:18:38.595 --> 01:18:43.390
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.390
Like eternity

01:18:47.393 --> 01:18:51.983
Is the night really still young?

01:18:53.426 --> 01:18:58.585
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

01:18:58.758 --> 01:19:03.587
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

01:19:03.757 --> 01:19:07.553
I can think no more

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:09.919
But this love

01:19:10.623 --> 01:19:14.919
Links the sea with the sky

01:19:38.687 --> 01:19:42.948
My eyes have been raining

01:19:43.686 --> 01:19:48.015
I can't hold on with both hands

01:19:48.586 --> 01:19:52.813
I cry as we seek happiness

01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:58.411
You're just like a shooting star

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:03.148
Those happy moments

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:08.443
Lock you between my brows

01:20:08.816 --> 01:20:13.145
No matter how the world dazzles

01:20:13.748 --> 01:20:18.908
It pales next to your eternal splendor

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:25.270
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:30.038
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:20:30.213 --> 01:20:33.269
Like eternity

01:20:34.379 --> 01:20:38.970
Is the night really still young?

01:20:39.612 --> 01:20:40.407
You love me?

01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:43.976
I think you're quite...

01:20:44.145 --> 01:20:46.508
Answer the question

01:20:47.711 --> 01:20:48.472
The fact is...

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.576
C'mon

01:20:51.277 --> 01:20:54.368
Answer in 4 words or less

01:20:54.877 --> 01:20:57.968
I love you

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:01.734
Or I don't

01:21:23.138 --> 01:21:25.366
When did you slip in?

01:21:25.604 --> 01:21:29.730
I'm in love

01:21:29.904 --> 01:21:35.302
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

01:21:35.836 --> 01:21:40.893
So don't get fooled by love

01:21:42.735 --> 01:21:45.826
You're such an optimist

01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:49.863
I have news for you

01:21:50.467 --> 01:21:51.195
What?

01:21:51.434 --> 01:21:52.661
Longyi's here

01:21:55.667 --> 01:21:56.996
He almost strangled me

01:21:57.367 --> 01:21:59.491
But I calmed him down

01:21:59.967 --> 01:22:01.523
He's been drunk ever since

01:22:02.866 --> 01:22:04.526
My fault

01:22:04.799 --> 01:22:08.561
No way

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.730
Listen, love is not sympathy

01:22:12.098 --> 01:22:14.155
You're tangled up...

01:22:14.332 --> 01:22:15.319
with Chan

01:22:15.498 --> 01:22:16.486
Don't let Longyi see you

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:23.928
Wine please No

01:22:24.097 --> 01:22:25.323
Wait

01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:26.493
Let go

01:22:26.963 --> 01:22:27.622
No

01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:28.820
Kitchen time

01:22:28.996 --> 01:22:29.552
Kitchen

01:22:31.829 --> 01:22:32.852
I need...

01:22:37.495 --> 01:22:38.325
What?

01:22:38.895 --> 01:22:39.758
I...

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:42.219
I need a glass

01:22:42.394 --> 01:22:43.791
I'll get it

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:46.253
Go inside

01:22:47.927 --> 01:22:49.051
No pushing

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:54.222
Albert

01:22:56.893 --> 01:22:58.222
Where's the opener?

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:02.454
Albert

01:23:04.258 --> 01:23:05.189
Smooth move

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:07.984
So cold!

01:23:08.158 --> 01:23:09.055
Albert

01:23:11.324 --> 01:23:12.381
Now what?

01:23:13.257 --> 01:23:16.620
I need the opener

01:23:20.057 --> 01:23:21.613
Where is it?

01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:23.217
Hurry!

01:23:28.856 --> 01:23:29.753
What's that?

01:23:31.621 --> 01:23:34.087
The family above us

01:23:34.255 --> 01:23:35.743
Has a brat

01:23:36.954 --> 01:23:38.420
It's from above us?

01:23:39.588 --> 01:23:41.951
Where else?

01:23:56.219 --> 01:23:57.650
It's from above us

01:23:58.418 --> 01:24:01.009
It's that brat again

01:24:02.084 --> 01:24:03.311
Opener

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:04.712
Forget it

01:24:06.984 --> 01:24:08.915
Drink it this way

01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:11.543
Wait Come

01:24:13.083 --> 01:24:13.548
Drink with me

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:17.374
You okay?

01:24:17.716 --> 01:24:21.079
I must tell C.N.

01:24:21.249 --> 01:24:22.475
A game...

01:24:22.648 --> 01:24:23.807
is fun

01:24:23.982 --> 01:24:26.243
Till its secret is revealed

01:24:26.648 --> 01:24:30.340
I know he loves me

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:34.812
He skips work to be with me

01:24:35.147 --> 01:24:38.170
I miss him day and night

01:24:38.813 --> 01:24:41.108
I'm like a child again

01:24:41.346 --> 01:24:44.278
Getting so attached to him

01:24:45.012 --> 01:24:46.773
I see something beautiful

01:24:47.145 --> 01:24:48.805
I want it for him

01:24:49.245 --> 01:24:52.642
Something happens, I want to tell him

01:24:53.078 --> 01:24:56.339
I'm so happy

01:24:56.877 --> 01:24:57.639
And...

01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:58.637
so cold!

01:24:59.377 --> 01:25:00.933
You're in love

01:25:04.176 --> 01:25:04.835
Need something?

01:25:05.443 --> 01:25:06.703
Sake

01:25:07.043 --> 01:25:08.168
Finish your wine first

01:25:08.343 --> 01:25:09.933
I want sake

01:25:10.275 --> 01:25:12.468
Just wait outside Sake

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.035
Hang on

01:25:18.675 --> 01:25:19.970
Excuse me

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:30.171
Let's sing

01:25:30.373 --> 01:25:32.429
This is not a Karaoke bar

01:25:33.439 --> 01:25:34.735
We don't have time

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.962
We'll split this

01:25:36.139 --> 01:25:36.696
Too much

01:25:36.972 --> 01:25:38.370
Not at all

01:25:38.638 --> 01:25:39.899
Enough

01:25:41.538 --> 01:25:42.765
Cheers

01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:47.337
You'll get drunk

01:25:49.504 --> 01:25:51.527
Drink it

01:25:56.237 --> 01:25:57.497
1... 2... 3...

01:25:57.670 --> 01:25:58.601
Down!

01:26:10.268 --> 01:26:11.460
Still kicking. Thank God

01:26:32.399 --> 01:26:34.126
She's safe here

01:26:39.431 --> 01:26:40.692
Here she is

01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:54.818
Gloria, Bu

01:26:55.196 --> 01:26:56.253
Gloria's a good friend

01:26:57.563 --> 01:26:59.391
She's the one impersonating me?

01:26:59.862 --> 01:27:00.259
Yes!

01:27:00.428 --> 01:27:01.325
Not bad

01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:08.417
You knew all along

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.319
Why con me?

01:27:13.726 --> 01:27:14.885
You started it

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:20.017
All the love I felt between us

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:24.818
That was just an act?

01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:27.614
Our happiness was no act

01:27:28.459 --> 01:27:29.447
If you like,

01:27:30.258 --> 01:27:31.655
stay in Hong Kong

01:27:33.257 --> 01:27:34.621
What am I?

01:27:36.191 --> 01:27:37.884
One of your women?

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.381
The bottle sent me to you

01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:49.619
A fairy tale becomes...

01:27:51.422 --> 01:27:53.081
a nightmare

01:28:10.453 --> 01:28:11.680
My big mouth

01:28:12.486 --> 01:28:13.543
No

01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:15.407
Get her back

01:28:15.718 --> 01:28:16.241
No

01:28:21.019 --> 01:28:23.143
Weren't we on the same plane?

01:28:25.051 --> 01:28:25.948
Back to Taiwan?

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:26.706
Yes

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:28.273
You had fun?

01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:29.878
It was okay

01:28:30.717 --> 01:28:32.080
I bought a lot,

01:28:32.317 --> 01:28:33.283
what about you?

01:28:35.316 --> 01:28:36.509
I...

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.212
I bought a story

01:28:38.616 --> 01:28:39.911
A story!

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:41.445
Is it in an office building?

01:28:55.381 --> 01:28:56.176
The government passed a law...

01:28:56.347 --> 01:28:57.937
prohibiting the use...

01:28:58.413 --> 01:28:59.572
of non-bio-degradable

01:28:59.747 --> 01:29:01.679
styrofoam

01:29:02.046 --> 01:29:02.740
LW's stock...

01:29:02.913 --> 01:29:05.970
dropped drastically

01:29:06.479 --> 01:29:08.877
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

01:29:09.245 --> 01:29:10.767
Major stockholders,

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.206
are dumping them

01:29:12.512 --> 01:29:13.136
You knew...

01:29:13.312 --> 01:29:15.209
the law would be passed?

01:29:16.545 --> 01:29:18.306
It was only a matter of time

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.307
Should we borrow money?

01:29:20.478 --> 01:29:21.773
Up to you guys

01:29:22.211 --> 01:29:22.835
Mr. Chan,

01:29:23.011 --> 01:29:25.408
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:27.573
Just to...

01:29:27.743 --> 01:29:28.674
get even

01:29:28.976 --> 01:29:30.237
I won't

01:29:31.543 --> 01:29:32.668
That's all for today

01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:33.399
The acquisition...

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:35.565
is a go?

01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:36.533
I'll let you know

01:30:52.298 --> 01:31:01.821
Love is like falling maples

01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:04.255
Like what?

01:31:05.463 --> 01:31:10.327
Like falling maples

01:31:10.496 --> 01:31:12.086
What does that mean?

01:31:12.929 --> 01:31:13.758
I don't know

01:31:16.095 --> 01:31:18.617
I've never seen you like this

01:31:18.795 --> 01:31:20.352
Paper everywhere

01:31:21.095 --> 01:31:22.560
Just do...

01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:24.626
what you have to do

01:31:25.328 --> 01:31:25.986
Again?

01:31:26.528 --> 01:31:27.652
Forget it

01:31:28.961 --> 01:31:29.517
What?

01:31:29.961 --> 01:31:31.256
Nothing

01:31:31.493 --> 01:31:32.981
Leave me alone

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:39.483
Fine, be that way

01:31:42.192 --> 01:31:43.919
You broke it?

01:31:44.292 --> 01:31:44.950
Good guess

01:31:46.358 --> 01:31:46.847
Sir

01:31:47.024 --> 01:31:47.820
Call 911

01:31:48.124 --> 01:31:49.112
They'll stop me

01:31:49.458 --> 01:31:50.116
Just call

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:01.416
See

01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:02.385
What do you want?

01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:03.914
You ruined our boss,

01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:05.120
lost us our jobs

01:32:05.922 --> 01:32:07.411
We came for payback

01:32:09.922 --> 01:32:11.148
Mr. Chan

01:32:13.288 --> 01:32:14.844
I heard you're back in training

01:32:15.088 --> 01:32:15.644
Yes, I am

01:32:16.088 --> 01:32:16.815
Rematch?

01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:18.344
Mr. Lo sent you?

01:32:18.588 --> 01:32:19.554
Mr. Lo is broke

01:32:20.321 --> 01:32:21.582
It's not about money

01:32:23.354 --> 01:32:24.785
Not now

01:32:25.753 --> 01:32:26.878
You got no choice

01:32:30.819 --> 01:32:32.910
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

01:32:34.385 --> 01:32:35.783
Only with the best

01:32:42.618 --> 01:32:45.708
What are they talking about?

01:32:46.251 --> 01:32:47.648
You never learned English...

01:32:47.817 --> 01:32:48.612
in school?

01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:49.714
C'mon, tell me

01:32:50.784 --> 01:32:51.306
No

01:32:55.482 --> 01:32:56.379
Okay

01:33:02.449 --> 01:33:03.210
Rules?

01:33:03.381 --> 01:33:04.278
No rules

01:33:06.515 --> 01:33:10.140
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

01:33:18.713 --> 01:33:19.940
You like white

01:33:30.378 --> 01:33:31.207
Are you sure?

01:33:32.911 --> 01:33:33.774
I'm sure

01:34:55.968 --> 01:34:56.797
Good training

01:35:51.928 --> 01:35:52.984
Wait

01:36:14.724 --> 01:36:15.712
Now what?

01:36:17.157 --> 01:36:19.146
"What's you okay?" In English?

01:36:19.623 --> 01:36:20.816
Are you okay?

01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:22.485
Are you okay?

01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:25.820
Okay

01:36:44.321 --> 01:36:45.116
Pretty good

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:48.415
I'm coming

01:37:54.145 --> 01:37:54.838
Ready?

01:38:25.041 --> 01:38:25.768
Come on

01:38:29.307 --> 01:38:31.739
Smile, don't worry

01:39:09.536 --> 01:39:10.433
Are you ready?

01:39:28.866 --> 01:39:30.764
Come on

01:40:35.125 --> 01:40:36.954
Don't worry, be happy

01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:13.649
Let's dance

01:41:36.284 --> 01:41:36.977
Let's finish

01:42:58.173 --> 01:42:59.298
Get up

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:00.437
On your feet

01:43:07.072 --> 01:43:08.060
You okay?

01:43:19.338 --> 01:43:20.099
Yes

01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:22.800
You won

01:43:23.137 --> 01:43:23.728
I lost

01:43:24.437 --> 01:43:24.993
Why?

01:43:25.836 --> 01:43:26.563
Pound for pound

01:43:26.736 --> 01:43:29.202
He'd have beaten me in no time

01:43:30.336 --> 01:43:31.427
See if he's all right

01:43:34.868 --> 01:43:35.925
You smell turpentine?

01:43:36.302 --> 01:43:37.733
The boss is setting a fire

01:43:39.802 --> 01:43:41.028
Fantastic

01:43:41.834 --> 01:43:42.857
But we'll go to jail

01:43:43.034 --> 01:43:43.931
Prison!

01:43:45.034 --> 01:43:46.522
This is nuts

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:47.966
Watch it

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:50.026
No sweat

01:43:50.733 --> 01:43:52.824
Hey, jail sucks, boss

01:43:54.633 --> 01:43:59.462
You checked there's nobody inside?

01:43:59.699 --> 01:44:00.824
Sure did

01:44:00.999 --> 01:44:02.056
Good

01:44:02.598 --> 01:44:05.393
Give this to dad

01:44:05.831 --> 01:44:07.694
Tell him I love him

01:44:08.631 --> 01:44:10.426
Give this to C.N.

01:44:10.664 --> 01:44:13.596
Tell him I hate him

01:44:14.230 --> 01:44:16.457
This is for the cops

01:44:16.964 --> 01:44:19.293
I'm claiming all responsibility

01:44:19.596 --> 01:44:21.528
Really?

01:44:21.696 --> 01:44:22.787
You're going to jail, not us?

01:44:26.929 --> 01:44:28.019
Me neither

01:44:29.895 --> 01:44:31.225
Stand aside

01:44:33.095 --> 01:44:34.822
C.N. And I go down together

01:44:34.994 --> 01:44:36.620
Don't do it, boss

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.450
My eyes hurt

01:44:40.493 --> 01:44:42.220
But so what?

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.787
I'm going to die anyway

01:44:45.226 --> 01:44:47.555
Bye, Mary

01:44:51.326 --> 01:44:52.848
Calm down, LW

01:44:53.492 --> 01:44:56.946
It's all your fault

01:44:57.191 --> 01:44:58.248
You took it too far

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.022
Dad kicked me off the Board

01:45:00.224 --> 01:45:02.281
I have nothing now

01:45:02.457 --> 01:45:03.582
I'm finished

01:45:04.657 --> 01:45:06.748
What about us, boss?

01:45:06.957 --> 01:45:08.150
Are we finished too?

01:45:08.656 --> 01:45:09.145
You're asking me?

01:45:09.324 --> 01:45:10.381
Yes

01:45:11.190 --> 01:45:12.212
Shut up

01:45:14.656 --> 01:45:15.951
Boss

01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:18.450
Okay now?

01:45:18.622 --> 01:45:19.451
Warmer still

01:45:20.655 --> 01:45:21.211
How's that?

01:45:21.522 --> 01:45:22.317
Just right

01:45:24.092 --> 01:45:24.989
Your eyes still hurt?

01:45:27.459 --> 01:45:28.550
Why be so nice to me?

01:45:28.892 --> 01:45:29.721
You wanted to ruin me

01:45:31.559 --> 01:45:32.217
Styrofoam's bad...

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:34.414
for the environment

01:45:35.058 --> 01:45:36.853
It needs to be regulated

01:45:37.059 --> 01:45:39.819
That motivated my acquisition

01:45:40.224 --> 01:45:41.519
Let's be partners

01:45:41.824 --> 01:45:44.756
In recycling paper

01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:47.745
That's not like you

01:45:48.491 --> 01:45:49.922
Ever since grade school

01:45:50.257 --> 01:45:51.517
You've had to beat me

01:45:52.156 --> 01:45:53.850
In whatever we do

01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:56.113
You stole my girlfriends

01:45:56.656 --> 01:45:59.554
And then dumped them

01:45:59.723 --> 01:46:00.711
Never really loved them

01:46:01.423 --> 01:46:02.286
I hated you so

01:46:03.289 --> 01:46:04.516
I hated you too

01:46:05.022 --> 01:46:06.578
Really? What for?

01:46:06.655 --> 01:46:07.643
For always laughing

01:46:08.255 --> 01:46:09.914
For being born so rich

01:46:10.988 --> 01:46:12.079
For your name

01:46:12.555 --> 01:46:14.645
Low Wow is a stupid name

01:46:16.122 --> 01:46:17.451
I hated you most

01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:19.914
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

01:46:21.235 --> 01:46:23.030
So it boils down to Ann

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.459
But she dumped me

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:31.865
She married that...

01:46:32.034 --> 01:46:35.363
Andy Law Andy Law

01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.583
That nerd

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.551
So dull

01:46:43.819 --> 01:46:45.046
We fought for so many years

01:46:46.053 --> 01:46:48.109
But we each haven't committed

01:46:48.752 --> 01:46:50.513
To loving only one woman

01:46:50.918 --> 01:46:53.713
But what about Mary?

01:46:53.885 --> 01:46:54.942
She's nothing

01:46:55.384 --> 01:46:56.441
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

01:46:57.284 --> 01:46:58.772
Weren't you engaged?

01:46:58.851 --> 01:46:59.874
What happened?

01:47:02.051 --> 01:47:04.107
I copped out

01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:08.740
but she's one great dame

01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:13.036
We were so happy together

01:47:13.716 --> 01:47:16.681
Laughing all day long

01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:21.205
Wish I could turn the clock back

01:47:23.614 --> 01:47:26.546
But she moved overseas

01:47:27.914 --> 01:47:29.504
I lost track of her

01:47:32.247 --> 01:47:34.405
What's wrong?

01:47:37.113 --> 01:47:37.942
See you later

01:47:39.246 --> 01:47:42.643
Did I say something?

01:47:47.379 --> 01:47:48.174
Skipper

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:49.943
Your Bu is back

01:47:50.312 --> 01:47:54.574
Yes, she is. Cheers

01:47:54.945 --> 01:47:58.536
Skipper, cheers

01:48:10.909 --> 01:48:11.738
What's that?

01:48:13.576 --> 01:48:14.633
Going to college?

01:48:15.975 --> 01:48:17.168
Considering it

01:48:20.409 --> 01:48:21.567
You've changed

01:48:23.141 --> 01:48:25.573
Love changes people

01:48:28.941 --> 01:48:30.304
Don't rush...

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.269
to forget him

01:48:34.673 --> 01:48:37.003
Or it'll get worse

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.062
One day

01:48:39.673 --> 01:48:41.036
You take a shower

01:48:41.206 --> 01:48:41.864
Listen to music

01:48:42.606 --> 01:48:44.503
And suddenly remember him

01:48:45.505 --> 01:48:48.266
Then you've forgotten him

01:48:53.138 --> 01:48:55.069
You're pretty when you smile

01:48:58.970 --> 01:48:59.765
Bu

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:04.530
Albert

01:49:04.703 --> 01:49:06.032
Where have you been?

01:49:06.602 --> 01:49:08.465
I was so worried

01:49:13.368 --> 01:49:14.527
You're not...

01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:16.299
really my type

01:49:19.835 --> 01:49:22.062
I like older men

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:23.597
I'm older than you

01:49:25.834 --> 01:49:27.094
I mean here

01:49:28.099 --> 01:49:29.030
Here?

01:49:29.833 --> 01:49:31.458
If I were your girl

01:49:31.766 --> 01:49:33.595
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

01:49:37.465 --> 01:49:38.725
You'll get it

01:49:39.132 --> 01:49:39.893
I miss you so

01:49:40.299 --> 01:49:41.628
I was so worried about you

01:49:43.464 --> 01:49:45.191
This must be your mother

01:49:45.664 --> 01:49:46.323
This is...

01:49:46.697 --> 01:49:48.822
Albert, my pal

01:49:52.463 --> 01:49:55.553
Can you be my adopted brother?

01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:57.352
Good idea

01:49:57.696 --> 01:49:58.593
I'm the adopted mother?

01:49:59.696 --> 01:50:00.457
Wait

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:03.593
Why not? Mom

01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.694
Son

01:50:05.195 --> 01:50:05.661
Mom

01:50:06.361 --> 01:50:08.350
My Albert

01:50:08.528 --> 01:50:08.959
Mom

01:50:41.057 --> 01:50:42.148
Bu! Bu!

01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:43.149
I missed you

01:50:45.123 --> 01:50:46.453
You miss me?

01:50:52.255 --> 01:50:53.186
Come back

01:50:54.055 --> 01:50:54.783
Bu!

01:50:57.655 --> 01:50:58.484
Bu!

01:51:30.051 --> 01:51:30.948
Bu!

01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:34.209
Scram

01:51:34.917 --> 01:51:37.008
It's you who bullied my daughter

01:51:37.184 --> 01:51:37.945
No, I didn't

01:51:38.284 --> 01:51:39.147
You did too

01:51:39.817 --> 01:51:42.839
She used to laugh all the time

01:51:43.216 --> 01:51:45.909
Now she hardly smiles

01:51:46.283 --> 01:51:49.180
My heart aches for her

01:51:49.749 --> 01:51:52.237
What did you do to her?

01:51:52.815 --> 01:51:54.338
Nothing

01:51:54.614 --> 01:51:56.341
Then why is she like this?

01:51:56.948 --> 01:51:58.675
Please let me talk to her

01:51:58.914 --> 01:52:00.607
Just...

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:03.837
leave her alone

01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:05.544
I don't speak Taiwanese

01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:07.541
He said leave her alone

01:52:07.712 --> 01:52:08.643
Beat it

01:52:12.046 --> 01:52:12.602
Bu!

01:52:14.345 --> 01:52:15.208
Bu!

01:52:15.845 --> 01:52:16.334
Get lost

01:52:16.512 --> 01:52:17.000
Bu

01:52:17.245 --> 01:52:17.710
Hit the road

01:52:19.145 --> 01:52:19.667
I...

01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:36.571
It's all right

01:52:47.008 --> 01:52:48.598
You bullied my niece

01:53:06.572 --> 01:53:07.196
Sir

01:53:18.604 --> 01:53:20.069
I'll just sit here

01:53:20.603 --> 01:53:22.069
Don't walk past me

01:53:23.236 --> 01:53:25.498
You dad's a cool dude

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:32.358
Sir, you okay?

01:53:33.335 --> 01:53:34.232
Are you hurt?

01:53:34.602 --> 01:53:36.760
Leave us alone

01:53:37.635 --> 01:53:38.965
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

01:53:39.134 --> 01:53:41.066
Waste of time

01:53:41.468 --> 01:53:42.728
Bu, I...

01:53:42.901 --> 01:53:44.060
Shut up

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.293
Bu!

01:53:48.567 --> 01:53:49.396
Shut up

01:53:50.799 --> 01:53:51.322
Bu!

01:53:51.632 --> 01:53:52.257
Shut up

01:53:53.666 --> 01:53:54.155
Bu!

01:53:56.032 --> 01:53:57.396
I'm warning you

01:53:58.065 --> 01:53:58.894
Either you kill me

01:53:59.865 --> 01:54:01.263
Or let me talk to her

01:54:05.598 --> 01:54:08.961
All right, come

01:54:10.464 --> 01:54:12.521
Speak up

01:54:14.896 --> 01:54:18.794
Now or never

01:54:19.162 --> 01:54:20.560
Don't disturb them

01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:21.956
I want to hear

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:29.992
Why bother?

01:54:34.494 --> 01:54:36.050
You left these

01:54:38.394 --> 01:54:39.620
I have plenty

01:54:45.026 --> 01:54:46.924
I brought Chinese pot rice

01:54:48.592 --> 01:54:50.524
It's cold, but it's your favorite

01:54:54.325 --> 01:54:58.256
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

01:55:01.558 --> 01:55:03.114
There's more

01:55:12.789 --> 01:55:14.220
I put a note in each one

01:55:15.322 --> 01:55:16.379
Saying what?

01:55:17.456 --> 01:55:19.546
I love you, I miss you

01:55:20.155 --> 01:55:21.518
Never over 4 words

01:55:22.022 --> 01:55:23.351
took me hours

01:55:25.854 --> 01:55:27.286
Too much work

01:55:27.821 --> 01:55:29.480
Just put $1,000 in each

01:55:29.854 --> 01:55:30.979
And you have me

01:55:44.086 --> 01:55:46.415
So do you love me?

01:55:47.618 --> 01:55:48.379
I love you

01:55:50.185 --> 01:55:51.741
Since when?

01:55:52.718 --> 01:55:54.274
Since you stole my name-card

01:55:56.451 --> 01:55:58.212
What wish did you make...

01:55:58.384 --> 01:55:59.576
on the boat?

01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:03.738
It's already come true

01:56:07.716 --> 01:56:09.545
Why do you cry?

01:56:12.482 --> 01:56:13.448
Kiss her

01:56:14.449 --> 01:56:16.676
Kiss her

01:56:16.915 --> 01:56:18.847
I'll say it in Cantonese

01:56:19.581 --> 01:56:20.569
Kiss her

01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:30.741
You're...

01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.238
Xiaojun

01:56:32.612 --> 01:56:34.271
Do I know you?

01:56:35.079 --> 01:56:36.443
I'm your neighbor

01:56:36.912 --> 01:56:38.741
Wow, fantastic!

01:56:39.145 --> 01:56:39.701
Why?

01:56:40.845 --> 01:56:41.833
Oh, weather is fine

01:56:56.609 --> 01:56:57.597
Look at them

01:57:12.008 --> 01:57:13.598
The women here are gorgeous

01:57:13.808 --> 01:57:14.239
I should have...

01:57:14.407 --> 01:57:15.100
Go to hell

01:57:15.674 --> 01:57:18.162
I want you to meet my dolphin

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:19.129
Really?

01:57:19.406 --> 01:57:22.167
Bu! Bu!

01:57:22.406 --> 01:57:23.167
Wow!
