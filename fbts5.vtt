00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:05.942
100 years ago,

00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:09.808
this island in Taiwan...

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:11.043
had nothing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.010
Only romance

00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:18.344
Legend has it

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.370
There were two lovers

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.344
And one day

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.668
The man was fishing

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.111
His boat sank

00:01:29.912 --> 00:01:31.207
The woman...

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:33.836
saw it onshore

00:01:34.578 --> 00:01:36.009
She swam out

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:40.373
No one ever saw them again

00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:41.904
Some say

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.108
they became dolphins

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:49.838
All dolphins around this island...

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.942
came from them

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:04.964
They all make...

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.799
"Bu... Bu" noises

00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:23.531
Nice story?

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:30.566
So snooty

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:35.025
You told a horror story

00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:39.367
Don't get involved

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.902
Have some melon

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:44.463
No

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.492
You're like...

00:02:45.668 --> 00:02:47.100
those dolphins

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.757
So picky

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.126
You named me Bu

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:56.160
I've told you so often

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.796
Don't mix Mandarin...

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:00.126
with Cantonese

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.595
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.823
are now both accented

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.823
You teach her Mandarin then

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.826
Get off my case

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.625
That's Cantonese again

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:19.795
Which I don't speak

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:23.490
What did you say?

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:26.225
Tell me

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:31.522
Skipper Restaurant

00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:52.224
Open bar, folks

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.549
One more round

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.985
Drink up

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.555
Go in and take a seat

00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:12.055
Long time no see

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:20.148
One more round?

00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:21.914
Not tonight

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:23.712
Can't afford it

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:26.488
On the house

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.677
Bu, 6 beers, on me

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.314
They come everyday

00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:34.454
Never pay

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:36.050
Add water...

00:04:36.222 --> 00:04:37.449
to the beer

00:04:38.155 --> 00:04:40.552
That trick again?

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:42.377
Bu Yes?

00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:43.951
Hurry

00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:45.884
Here

00:04:46.054 --> 00:04:47.747
Did you add water?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.943
No!

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.946
No, very good

00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:52.419
C'mon

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.109
Cheers

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:07.450
Why, Bu?

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:10.440
Idiot

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:13.410
You could've spared me

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.445
They sing

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.806
Watch TV

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:23.512
Or pick fights

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.844
This island

00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:27.605
Has no room...

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:29.036
for romance

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.642
Done

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:53.476
Beautiful

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.338
I learned it...

00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:55.909
from a magazine

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:02.808
Bu

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.236
I brought you something

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:10.464
I've never seen...

00:06:11.243 --> 00:06:13.708
an oyster this big

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:16.499
Any pearls?

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.175
No

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.106
Must be expensive

00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:25.599
NT$3,000

00:06:29.074 --> 00:06:29.869
Thanks

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.404
And this

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.603
It's my friend's shop

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:37.997
He'll give us a discount

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:39.865
I'm...

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:42.396
Proposing?

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.264
No, I just want to...

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.699
Yes, I'm proposing

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:49.895
With...

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:51.900
a big oyster?

00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:53.228
Of course not

00:06:53.404 --> 00:06:54.700
The oyster's not...

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.331
Marry me

00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:00.598
Okay

00:07:03.203 --> 00:07:04.362
I'll consider it

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.193
Poor Longyi

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:21.797
This oyster's not cheap

00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:25.626
He proposed to me

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:27.959
Really?

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:30.090
You love him?

00:07:32.166 --> 00:07:33.995
Well, he's actually...

00:07:34.732 --> 00:07:35.992
Not bad

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.160
Your answer

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:39.729
Shouldn't be over 4 words

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:41.488
You love him, or you don't

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:58.685
You left Hong Kong...

00:07:58.863 --> 00:08:00.123
to marry dad, why?

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:02.650
He was quite a hunk

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.717
A good cook too

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:08.451
You're a good cook

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:10.053
He's better

00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.290
He cooks with love

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.022
What's loving someone like?

00:08:23.393 --> 00:08:26.586
You miss him

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:30.185
The sight of him thrills you

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:31.816
You ache

00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:34.324
When he's gone

00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:40.185
You could watch him forever

00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:42.381
Even when he's sleeping

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.379
You're in love

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.921
If you feel like that

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:49.618
Okay?

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:05.776
You miss Hong Kong?

00:09:06.154 --> 00:09:09.551
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

00:09:10.053 --> 00:09:10.747
I see

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.947
You don't love Longyi

00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:17.709
Take mama's advice

00:09:18.352 --> 00:09:20.215
Trust your heart

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.981
Do what you have to do

00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:31.277
Bu

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.805
Hey, kid

00:09:47.183 --> 00:09:48.978
Got some news

00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:51.539
Longyi proposed

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:54.408
Don't laugh

00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:00.244
Somebody said

00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:05.545
Men and women...

00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:07.907
exist in pairs

00:10:08.446 --> 00:10:12.241
Till separated on earth

00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:16.968
Then they go through life

00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:20.110
Searching for one another

00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:23.369
Bu

00:10:24.178 --> 00:10:25.541
Where are you going?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.942
Bu!

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.962
I'm waiting for you!

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.436
Hong Kong, Albert?

00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:03.762
How romantic!

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:00.787
You're telling me something?

00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:04.461
You choose for me

00:13:00.057 --> 00:13:02.148
You just decided my future

00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:08.216
Excuse me

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.083
You know a good cafe?

00:13:12.523 --> 00:13:13.955
Sure, we'll go together

00:13:14.256 --> 00:13:15.279
Thanks

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:26.049
Typical Taiwanese!

00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:28.248
Pardon me?

00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:30.286
You speak Cantonese?

00:13:30.487 --> 00:13:31.384
Surprised?

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.811
Never flown before?

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:44.780
It shows?

00:13:45.153 --> 00:13:46.413
Yes

00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:50.642
You can get lost in Hong Kong

00:13:50.985 --> 00:13:52.575
I'll show you around

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:54.346
I know...

00:13:54.718 --> 00:13:55.876
all the trendy spots

00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.374
I have fans everywhere

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.016
I'm a fun guy

00:14:00.517 --> 00:14:01.380
Okay?

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:12.011
What?

00:14:12.516 --> 00:14:13.573
Are you twins?

00:14:16.848 --> 00:14:17.779
Please forgive me

00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:20.777
Excuse me

00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:23.980
Gangster's girlfriend

00:14:24.148 --> 00:14:25.841
disappears

00:14:55.877 --> 00:14:58.240
Morning, sir, working out?

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:00.775
No time

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.938
Bill, are you ready?

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.469
Good

00:15:23.507 --> 00:15:25.631
Let's start

00:15:29.606 --> 00:15:30.594
Morning, Mr. Chan

00:15:31.072 --> 00:15:33.334
Any news from Wall Street?

00:15:33.538 --> 00:15:34.368
Lion Fund...

00:15:34.538 --> 00:15:37.402
is borrowing heavily

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.898
Even at...

00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:41.764
a 20% interbank rate

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.561
Check the following

00:15:48.003 --> 00:15:49.230
How many Nikkei Futures...

00:15:49.403 --> 00:15:51.130
did they short?

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:54.130
Is Yen...

00:15:54.302 --> 00:15:55.927
appreciating?

00:15:56.668 --> 00:15:59.100
Is the lease for the US base...

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:00.393
in Japan expiring?

00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:03.261
If both answer are affirmative

00:16:03.535 --> 00:16:04.898
Buy whatever they sell

00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:06.395
But this hedge fund

00:16:06.567 --> 00:16:08.692
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:11.390
Should be invincible

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.957
They're too greedy

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.925
on margin trading

00:16:15.234 --> 00:16:17.062
Leveraging 10 times their worth

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:18.324
They're doomed

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.822
So go ahead

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:20.965
Yes, Mr. Chan

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:21.891
Thank you

00:16:29.664 --> 00:16:31.289
Send this with 100 roses...

00:16:31.464 --> 00:16:33.054
to Carman

00:16:33.464 --> 00:16:35.020
During office hours

00:16:36.097 --> 00:16:37.562
Didn't you break up?

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:39.428
We're still friends

00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:44.521
Find someone and

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:47.560
settle down

00:16:47.996 --> 00:16:48.757
Like who?

00:16:49.895 --> 00:16:51.384
Those women around you

00:16:52.795 --> 00:16:55.955
All so beautiful and elegant

00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:58.016
Too elegant for me

00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:00.654
What do you want?

00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:03.052
Someone amusing

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:07.651
Make yourself at home

00:18:11.018 --> 00:18:13.609
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:17.611
And you came...

00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:19.749
all that way

00:18:20.784 --> 00:18:22.773
How brave and romantic

00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:29.174
However...

00:18:29.783 --> 00:18:30.806
What?

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.447
I...

00:18:34.583 --> 00:18:35.480
What?

00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:43.971
I'm gay

00:18:48.414 --> 00:18:49.607
No

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.941
Yes

00:18:51.114 --> 00:18:51.841
Really?

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.009
Really

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.139
No

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.102
Yes

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:55.802
Honest?

00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:56.570
Honest

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.201
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:03.940
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:04.578
What?

00:19:04.746 --> 00:19:05.643
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:08.135
Such a waste

00:19:08.411 --> 00:19:09.809
Why?

00:19:10.177 --> 00:19:12.302
You're a hunk

00:19:12.478 --> 00:19:14.034
I'm not

00:19:24.043 --> 00:19:25.474
That's stunning

00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:29.998
That's what inspired you

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:33.265
I moved here because of it

00:19:37.874 --> 00:19:40.170
Find a motel tonight

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.006
Fly home tomorrow

00:19:42.407 --> 00:19:45.396
I've never traveled

00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:47.267
This is a first

00:19:47.439 --> 00:19:48.769
Think I'll stay a while

00:19:49.573 --> 00:19:50.698
But Hong Kong...

00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:52.263
is boring

00:19:53.072 --> 00:19:54.163
Fly back tomorrow

00:19:54.605 --> 00:19:56.400
My friend said

00:19:56.805 --> 00:19:57.896
Hong Kong's fun

00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:01.665
Great restaurants too

00:20:02.171 --> 00:20:04.602
I'll find you...

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:05.668
a motel

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.567
I can't afford one

00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:09.565
Hands off Wait

00:20:11.037 --> 00:20:12.969
Let me stay here

00:20:13.137 --> 00:20:14.693
Women can't stay here

00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:16.925
I'll go nuts

00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:19.933
Please

00:20:20.103 --> 00:20:21.932
Sorry Please

00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:30.491
I came all this way

00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:33.431
To such a big let down

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:37.258
I don't deserve this

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:41.821
Goodbye

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:48.497
Bu

00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:49.029
What?

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:49.994
Your suitcase

00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:13.054
Your bag

00:21:15.862 --> 00:21:18.020
I can't stand crying

00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:20.326
Makes me feel so guilty

00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:21.852
Okay, stay

00:21:22.195 --> 00:21:25.160
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.655
I'm a makeup artist

00:21:28.993 --> 00:21:31.255
Best...

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:33.717
in Hong Kong

00:21:44.925 --> 00:21:45.482
Exquisite

00:21:49.457 --> 00:21:50.047
That's it

00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:13.012
Hold that

00:22:16.054 --> 00:22:16.849
Good

00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:36.312
I'm starving

00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:37.508
We'll wrap soon

00:22:38.084 --> 00:22:39.482
How much longer?

00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:41.541
6 hours

00:22:42.617 --> 00:22:44.139
What?

00:22:44.384 --> 00:22:47.316
Keep that door shut

00:22:47.817 --> 00:22:49.340
We're reloading

00:22:49.683 --> 00:22:51.239
You'll fog the film

00:23:28.645 --> 00:23:31.304
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:33.610
No... no emergency

00:23:33.877 --> 00:23:36.502
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.974
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

00:23:42.709 --> 00:23:44.107
Tell me, what's going on?

00:23:49.009 --> 00:23:50.202
Maybe you'd better go

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:17.102
C.N. You're cruising and

00:24:17.273 --> 00:24:18.533
didn't invite me?

00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:21.171
Why bother, here you are

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:23.129
The press says you're romancing my girl

00:24:23.738 --> 00:24:24.795
You believe them?

00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:26.397
Grow up, LW

00:24:28.704 --> 00:24:30.363
Is it true?

00:24:31.104 --> 00:24:31.626
Yes

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.627
We've been competing since grade school

00:24:47.135 --> 00:24:48.464
You've been interested in...

00:24:48.635 --> 00:24:49.566
our stock lately

00:24:49.835 --> 00:24:51.232
I'm interested in all stocks,

00:24:51.401 --> 00:24:52.492
not just yours

00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:55.098
My associates and I

00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:58.025
Hold a majority of the shares

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.857
You can't touch my company

00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:01.825
We'll see

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.959
You're on my yacht

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:07.595
Dating my girl

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.265
And you talk to me like this

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:12.560
Why did you want me here?

00:25:15.665 --> 00:25:16.631
For an apology

00:25:18.697 --> 00:25:20.458
To make it easier on you

00:25:20.697 --> 00:25:22.424
I'm leaving now

00:25:22.898 --> 00:25:24.863
Call me...

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.893
to apologize in...

00:25:27.897 --> 00:25:28.658
5 minutes

00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:31.886
What time is it?

00:25:33.463 --> 00:25:34.587
5:30

00:25:35.829 --> 00:25:36.920
Why wear...

00:25:37.096 --> 00:25:37.823
a watch

00:25:38.062 --> 00:25:39.084
That can't tell time

00:25:39.629 --> 00:25:41.322
I like the diamonds

00:25:43.228 --> 00:25:44.091
Watch him

00:25:45.694 --> 00:25:46.989
If he doesn't call me in five

00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:48.857
Throw him overboard

00:25:50.261 --> 00:25:51.658
But give him a buoy

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.553
Yes, boss

00:25:53.226 --> 00:25:53.749
Call me

00:26:06.758 --> 00:26:07.689
Bye, boss

00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:11.886
Call him

00:26:12.324 --> 00:26:13.312
Or you'll get wet

00:26:14.491 --> 00:26:15.252
Make it snappy

00:26:15.423 --> 00:26:17.855
I've got a hot date

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.881
Don't force us to do it

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.083
Get a buoy

00:26:22.257 --> 00:26:22.984
Right

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.380
Come

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.614
Hands off

00:26:25.923 --> 00:26:26.445
Easy

00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:33.843
Almost

00:26:40.587 --> 00:26:41.110
Bye

00:26:41.521 --> 00:26:42.612
Here comes the buoy

00:26:42.788 --> 00:26:43.481
It's Fatty

00:26:45.087 --> 00:26:46.417
Fatty fell over

00:26:51.086 --> 00:26:52.177
Don't go

00:26:59.752 --> 00:27:00.581
Help him up

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:01.716
Over there

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.775
Scared me

00:27:49.812 --> 00:27:50.903
You okay?

00:27:51.179 --> 00:27:51.803
I'm fine

00:28:06.943 --> 00:28:07.670
Call you

00:28:17.975 --> 00:28:18.703
Where is he?

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:31.064
Where is he?

00:28:31.774 --> 00:28:32.467
You okay?

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.037
Don't fall over again

00:28:38.106 --> 00:28:39.969
You! He's here!

00:28:42.172 --> 00:28:42.933
In the rear

00:28:43.738 --> 00:28:45.068
Help...

00:28:47.172 --> 00:28:48.432
Hold tight

00:28:49.138 --> 00:28:50.399
Close

00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:55.225
You see him?

00:28:55.971 --> 00:28:56.527
No

00:28:56.871 --> 00:28:57.336
Look again

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.027
Over there

00:29:32.532 --> 00:29:33.828
He got away

00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:34.623
Wait

00:29:34.999 --> 00:29:36.589
The boss wanted him...

00:29:36.766 --> 00:29:38.595
overboard with a buoy

00:29:38.831 --> 00:29:39.956
Job's done, right?

00:29:40.232 --> 00:29:41.129
Right

00:29:41.397 --> 00:29:42.886
It's a wrap

00:30:12.094 --> 00:30:13.082
Thanks

00:30:13.927 --> 00:30:14.722
You okay?

00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:18.619
You're...

00:30:19.626 --> 00:30:20.388
Name's Bu

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.316
Bu?

00:30:24.292 --> 00:30:25.121
You a refugee?

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.749
Yes

00:30:28.959 --> 00:30:29.947
From Vietnam?

00:30:31.191 --> 00:30:32.748
Right again

00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:35.121
How many of you?

00:30:35.691 --> 00:30:36.782
Just me, why?

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.213
Who's driving?

00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:53.853
Give me a hand

00:30:54.388 --> 00:30:58.615
I can't, I'm starving

00:30:59.388 --> 00:31:00.410
Aren't you?

00:31:00.988 --> 00:31:04.181
No, but I could use a snack

00:31:12.587 --> 00:31:16.848
Let's talk

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:18.007
so I forget the hunger

00:31:18.853 --> 00:31:19.580
About what?

00:31:21.818 --> 00:31:24.284
What do you like?

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.973
Nothing?

00:31:29.518 --> 00:31:31.847
Not even cars and women?

00:31:34.617 --> 00:31:37.174
Don't just smile

00:31:37.816 --> 00:31:39.873
Okay, what don't you like?

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.912
Nosy people

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.277
What don't you like?

00:32:01.447 --> 00:32:05.344
Growing up,

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.507
I like being naughty

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.441
Nosy?

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:10.977
Naughty

00:32:11.479 --> 00:32:12.173
Naughty

00:32:12.378 --> 00:32:13.173
And no one...

00:32:13.812 --> 00:32:16.300
pampers you anymore

00:32:16.778 --> 00:32:17.540
What do you like?

00:32:19.878 --> 00:32:21.844
A shower when I'm sweaty

00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:23.969
Snap out of bed...

00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:26.002
to a cup of coffee

00:32:29.777 --> 00:32:31.106
I'd like one now

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:36.502
Hong Kong stars are lovely

00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:38.931
Stars are...

00:32:39.576 --> 00:32:41.666
the same everywhere

00:32:42.342 --> 00:32:44.637
If you care to look at them

00:32:49.741 --> 00:32:50.298
What?

00:32:50.941 --> 00:32:51.907
Shooting star!

00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:53.335
Really?

00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:56.234
Mom said when you see one

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:58.838
Touch your pocket and make a wish

00:32:59.006 --> 00:32:59.903
And it'll come true

00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:01.896
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

00:33:03.673 --> 00:33:05.002
Another one

00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:17.429
What's your wish?

00:33:18.404 --> 00:33:20.427
Can't tell you

00:33:26.303 --> 00:33:28.098
Or it won't come true

00:33:31.836 --> 00:33:32.767
I'm so sleepy

00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:27.889
A boat! Help!

00:34:34.195 --> 00:34:36.683
Over here!

00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:16.250
The Silicon Valley stocks?

00:35:18.922 --> 00:35:21.320
They'll go even higher

00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:27.314
Check one thing

00:35:28.188 --> 00:35:29.847
Does LW control...

00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:31.049
his company's shares?

00:35:50.418 --> 00:35:51.509
Buy me a new mobile

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:54.117
It drowned

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.481
There's no transport...

00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:08.138
around here

00:36:08.316 --> 00:36:09.645
I'll give you a ride

00:36:10.515 --> 00:36:13.242
Just tell me where I am

00:36:13.415 --> 00:36:14.506
and I'll walk back

00:36:14.681 --> 00:36:16.510
We're out

00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:19.306
in the boonies, Miss

00:36:19.748 --> 00:36:20.805
Name's Bu

00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:23.137
Boo? Bu!

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:24.870
Just get in

00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:25.637
Sure

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.743
Not you, this lady here

00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:34.706
There are only 2 seats

00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:36.040
I know

00:36:36.546 --> 00:36:37.909
Here's 20 bucks

00:36:38.079 --> 00:36:40.670
Around the corner...

00:36:40.845 --> 00:36:42.606
are buses and cabs

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.964
Compulsive liar

00:37:12.374 --> 00:37:13.170
Come in

00:37:15.674 --> 00:37:17.606
Huge place, you live alone?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.863
There's a butler

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.430
Must get crowded

00:37:23.406 --> 00:37:24.429
Wait here

00:37:24.707 --> 00:37:25.536
Can I look around?

00:37:25.706 --> 00:37:26.502
Help yourself

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:27.262
Thanks

00:37:42.237 --> 00:37:43.066
I'm starving

00:37:49.437 --> 00:37:51.369
Some food please!

00:38:32.264 --> 00:38:32.958
Need something?

00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:35.023
Fish food

00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:37.487
They're electronic fish

00:38:39.396 --> 00:38:41.056
Come over here

00:38:41.363 --> 00:38:42.761
Why electronic fish?

00:38:43.396 --> 00:38:44.884
I never change the water

00:38:45.063 --> 00:38:46.824
Fish never die, it's perfect

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:48.027
And if the power's out?

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:53.859
You invite friends over?

00:38:54.395 --> 00:38:55.122
Don't have any

00:38:55.594 --> 00:38:56.457
So boring, and lonely

00:39:09.759 --> 00:39:10.486
Now what?

00:39:12.392 --> 00:39:13.517
You like to fight?

00:39:14.292 --> 00:39:15.519
Some golf,

00:39:16.325 --> 00:39:17.585
some race horses

00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:20.019
I box and work out

00:39:21.591 --> 00:39:22.818
What's the octopus for?

00:39:23.324 --> 00:39:24.290
You're so nosy

00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:25.617
Sorry

00:39:33.956 --> 00:39:36.183
This should fit, change in there

00:39:49.288 --> 00:39:51.719
Betty, call me a cab

00:39:52.988 --> 00:39:54.214
20 minutes? Great

00:40:22.483 --> 00:40:23.642
There's a room...

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.210
behind the mirror

00:40:28.783 --> 00:40:31.476
How would I have known?

00:40:33.982 --> 00:40:34.505
Hungry?

00:40:35.149 --> 00:40:36.705
Starving

00:40:37.082 --> 00:40:38.241
Me too

00:40:38.948 --> 00:40:41.243
Any Chinese pot rice?

00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:43.071
What?

00:40:56.179 --> 00:40:58.111
Best take out food ever

00:40:58.646 --> 00:41:00.111
My favorite

00:41:01.645 --> 00:41:03.270
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:05.035
I hate the smell

00:41:09.045 --> 00:41:11.272
Don't stare. Eat up

00:41:11.778 --> 00:41:12.573
Sure

00:41:29.808 --> 00:41:30.604
Now what?

00:41:30.975 --> 00:41:32.441
You're amusing when you eat

00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:39.270
Are you rich?

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.635
I guess so

00:41:42.573 --> 00:41:43.334
What do you do?

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:44.834
I'm into trash

00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:46.473
C'mon

00:41:46.939 --> 00:41:47.962
No, I sell trash

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.930
Be that way

00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:03.101
Can I have a soda?

00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:04.595
Juice is better for you

00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:31.900
Bu took the lift down

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.364
What's wrong?

00:43:04.996 --> 00:43:07.518
Stop moaning

00:43:10.096 --> 00:43:11.823
You know

00:43:12.262 --> 00:43:15.853
That bottle's very special

00:43:16.062 --> 00:43:16.959
So special that...

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:19.187
all of a sudden

00:43:19.361 --> 00:43:21.224
I'm feeding and sheltering you

00:43:21.395 --> 00:43:22.156
Just like that

00:43:22.495 --> 00:43:25.392
Remember I told you about...

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.526
C. N? More than once

00:43:27.694 --> 00:43:29.852
Last night...

00:43:30.027 --> 00:43:32.322
You told me that too

00:43:32.826 --> 00:43:36.724
I think he's... nice

00:43:36.925 --> 00:43:37.652
Nice?

00:43:40.825 --> 00:43:43.518
These magazines are published weekly

00:43:43.692 --> 00:43:46.385
And he changes girlfriends just as often

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:50.423
He's not nice, he's a playboy

00:43:50.591 --> 00:43:51.386
Let's see

00:43:52.157 --> 00:43:53.521
An ex-girlfriend says

00:43:57.923 --> 00:44:01.286
He doesn't say sweet words

00:44:01.756 --> 00:44:04.847
But he's a romantic man

00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:08.612
He appears stem and talks tough

00:44:09.222 --> 00:44:11.279
Inside he's like a kid

00:44:12.254 --> 00:44:15.243
He's competitive and chases novelty

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.218
Never regrets any decision

00:44:19.187 --> 00:44:20.118
With him...

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.647
You feel insecure

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.751
Meaning?

00:44:25.286 --> 00:44:27.376
Chases novelty, so he fools around

00:44:27.986 --> 00:44:29.508
No regrets,

00:44:29.853 --> 00:44:31.182
so he enjoys dumping women

00:44:31.419 --> 00:44:33.317
Maybe those women deserved it

00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:34.949
They were insecure...

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:37.641
to begin with

00:44:37.918 --> 00:44:39.042
Spare me

00:44:42.651 --> 00:44:44.674
Hong Kong's boring anyway

00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:47.108
Going home?

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:50.447
No, C.N. Is fun

00:44:52.316 --> 00:44:54.305
You have to hook him first

00:44:54.949 --> 00:44:55.643
Can't just walk up

00:44:55.815 --> 00:44:57.610
And take off your clothes

00:44:57.915 --> 00:44:59.710
That sure won't work

00:44:59.882 --> 00:45:01.438
But you never know

00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:02.938
He's competitive and

00:45:03.115 --> 00:45:05.240
chases novelty

00:45:05.547 --> 00:45:07.513
I have a plan, I need your help

00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:08.374
No way

00:45:09.247 --> 00:45:10.713
Please

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:12.976
Sorry

00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:16.804
Please tell me

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.809
where your daughter is

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.770
She found a bottle

00:45:20.946 --> 00:45:22.310
She's in Hong Kong

00:45:24.379 --> 00:45:26.641
I have to get Bu back

00:45:27.512 --> 00:45:28.307
Chow Yun Fat!

00:45:29.112 --> 00:45:32.441
Mr. Chow

00:45:34.244 --> 00:45:35.800
Wrong guy

00:45:35.977 --> 00:45:36.943
You speak Mandarin?

00:45:37.311 --> 00:45:39.140
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:40.970
Don't try to fool me

00:45:41.143 --> 00:45:42.870
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

00:45:43.943 --> 00:45:46.171
Mr. Chow, you're back!

00:45:46.442 --> 00:45:47.567
Fresh form Hollywood?

00:45:47.743 --> 00:45:48.936
Please sign Can I take a picture?

00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:51.632
You mind? OK

00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:55.472
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

00:45:55.642 --> 00:45:58.903
My turn, miss

00:45:59.274 --> 00:46:01.535
Point a gun at me

00:46:01.707 --> 00:46:04.138
Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:07.599
Thank you, Mr. Chow

00:46:08.173 --> 00:46:10.730
Give me a hug

00:46:13.606 --> 00:46:16.003
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:17.601
I'll send you the photos

00:46:17.772 --> 00:46:19.068
Bye You're so sweet

00:46:19.238 --> 00:46:20.100
Same as the photo

00:46:20.171 --> 00:46:21.159
Print me a copy

00:46:23.005 --> 00:46:24.630
He's such a hunk Bye

00:46:24.804 --> 00:46:25.667
Bye

00:46:27.838 --> 00:46:28.633
My bag!

00:46:35.269 --> 00:46:36.667
We checked LW's company

00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:38.162
Last year,

00:46:38.336 --> 00:46:39.665
rumover grew 13%

00:46:39.902 --> 00:46:42.595
Profit: Over HK$1 billion

00:46:42.969 --> 00:46:45.594
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

00:46:46.035 --> 00:46:47.160
We have acquired...

00:46:47.335 --> 00:46:49.527
16% of the company

00:46:49.935 --> 00:46:53.059
LW and his associates...

00:46:53.234 --> 00:46:55.496
still hold 65%

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.857
But...

00:46:58.134 --> 00:46:59.599
they're not selling

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.357
Dump all my stocks

00:47:03.933 --> 00:47:06.296
If we dump them,

00:47:06.466 --> 00:47:07.591
the price will plunge

00:47:07.766 --> 00:47:11.925
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

00:47:12.432 --> 00:47:14.397
Just do it

00:47:17.665 --> 00:47:18.631
I need to see K.K.

00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:19.624
Yes, sir

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:21.326
Who's K. K?

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.291
Head of Environmental Protection

00:48:23.689 --> 00:48:25.655
Going up or down?

00:48:26.123 --> 00:48:28.418
I was seeing friends upstairs

00:48:28.955 --> 00:48:29.784
There's no upstairs

00:48:31.022 --> 00:48:31.817
Really?

00:48:33.222 --> 00:48:36.187
Actually they live downstairs

00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:37.079
Names?

00:48:38.587 --> 00:48:39.985
I forgot

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.477
So quiet here

00:48:45.853 --> 00:48:48.285
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

00:48:48.486 --> 00:48:49.975
You messed up my wall

00:48:51.986 --> 00:48:53.009
Excuse me?

00:49:00.585 --> 00:49:02.312
Look!

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.041
Easy there

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.743
Let go

00:49:12.917 --> 00:49:13.712
Who sent you?

00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:15.378
Let go first

00:49:17.882 --> 00:49:18.643
Like my writing?

00:49:30.414 --> 00:49:33.039
Enough. I don't know kungfu

00:49:33.381 --> 00:49:34.539
I'm just a messenger

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.404
Message?

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.107
My back pocket

00:49:46.779 --> 00:49:51.370
Bully. You messed up my arm

00:49:51.545 --> 00:49:52.533
Happy reading

00:49:55.011 --> 00:49:55.443
Gangster's girlfriend...

00:49:55.612 --> 00:49:56.202
disappears

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.203
What happened?

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:05.201
Fell down some stairs

00:50:05.377 --> 00:50:06.035
You okay?

00:50:06.277 --> 00:50:06.640
I'll live

00:50:07.177 --> 00:50:09.267
Will he buy...

00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:10.773
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

00:50:11.009 --> 00:50:12.134
How should I know?

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:13.834
Will it work?

00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:15.365
Of course

00:50:17.675 --> 00:50:18.698
What's next?

00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:20.965
Showtime

00:50:21.141 --> 00:50:22.504
Where are your pals?

00:50:30.374 --> 00:50:31.930
You know we're bad

00:50:32.107 --> 00:50:33.629
We're here to waste you

00:50:34.273 --> 00:50:35.170
React!

00:50:35.772 --> 00:50:36.999
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

00:50:37.173 --> 00:50:40.627
Is a Taiwanese gangster

00:50:40.806 --> 00:50:42.271
The sworn enemy of our boss

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.462
He wants you defaced

00:50:44.639 --> 00:50:46.536
Frog, your turn

00:50:46.771 --> 00:50:48.327
Believe it or not

00:50:48.671 --> 00:50:50.500
You're front page news

00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:53.630
Everyone's looking for you now

00:50:56.904 --> 00:50:58.164
Yes. Looking awesome

00:51:24.434 --> 00:51:25.024
You okay?

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.629
Yes, and you?

00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:29.394
It's you!

00:51:29.633 --> 00:51:30.098
You okay?

00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:30.923
Yes

00:51:36.465 --> 00:51:37.396
I don't know these goons

00:51:37.565 --> 00:51:38.155
What?

00:51:38.498 --> 00:51:38.929
Nothing

00:52:10.428 --> 00:52:11.688
You can't be ID'ed

00:52:13.328 --> 00:52:14.816
They're damn good actors

00:53:25.718 --> 00:53:26.877
Back off

00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:29.082
Stay here

00:53:29.251 --> 00:53:31.308
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

00:53:31.617 --> 00:53:32.708
You're bleeding

00:53:34.784 --> 00:53:36.511
We'll spare you today

00:53:36.784 --> 00:53:38.647
Don't provoke him

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.909
Cops will go after them

00:53:42.183 --> 00:53:42.739
Not us

00:53:44.949 --> 00:53:45.915
Hi, there

00:53:46.282 --> 00:53:52.544
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

00:53:53.114 --> 00:53:53.875
Thanks

00:53:54.381 --> 00:53:56.108
Someone reported a fight

00:53:56.281 --> 00:53:57.008
We were attacked

00:53:57.281 --> 00:53:58.371
They leave any evidence?

00:53:58.714 --> 00:53:59.771
Baseball bats

00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:03.442
Sunny, smell

00:54:04.613 --> 00:54:06.170
Any clues?

00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:19.441
Sunny, you're clueless

00:54:20.078 --> 00:54:21.509
Let's get help

00:54:26.544 --> 00:54:28.032
My site, very safe

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.169
It's so trashy

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:32.839
I told you I sell trash

00:54:33.176 --> 00:54:34.801
Expensive stuff too

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:38.103
Expensive? Trash is trash

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:40.068
Before you were...

00:54:40.375 --> 00:54:41.432
a Vietnamese refugee

00:54:41.808 --> 00:54:43.035
Now you're...

00:54:43.342 --> 00:54:45.364
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:47.305
So who are you, really?

00:54:47.808 --> 00:54:50.602
A dangerous woman

00:54:50.874 --> 00:54:51.737
Scared?

00:54:52.507 --> 00:54:53.370
Never

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.499
Thrilled to be with me?

00:55:00.906 --> 00:55:03.201
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

00:55:05.005 --> 00:55:07.698
I lived near a police station

00:55:07.972 --> 00:55:10.733
with posters of wanted criminals

00:55:11.338 --> 00:55:15.565
One of them was a hunk

00:55:16.004 --> 00:55:18.492
I saw his poster everyday

00:55:19.137 --> 00:55:21.898
And I fell in love

00:55:22.203 --> 00:55:22.930
And?

00:55:23.803 --> 00:55:27.098
I found him, stole his heart

00:55:28.036 --> 00:55:29.525
How was he?

00:55:30.602 --> 00:55:34.159
Cute, a great dancer

00:55:36.368 --> 00:55:37.856
Really romantic

00:55:39.568 --> 00:55:40.795
For being a dancer?

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.757
You dance?

00:55:44.334 --> 00:55:44.958
Of course

00:55:48.134 --> 00:55:49.031
This?

00:55:51.099 --> 00:55:51.758
Sure

00:55:53.666 --> 00:55:54.825
Tango?

00:55:59.532 --> 00:56:00.293
That too

00:56:01.232 --> 00:56:04.322
So common, nothing more exciting?

00:56:04.731 --> 00:56:06.060
Sure Really?

00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:07.928
Teach me

00:56:09.797 --> 00:56:10.626
You'll be scared

00:56:10.864 --> 00:56:11.761
No way

00:56:14.297 --> 00:56:15.285
Hold me

00:56:15.764 --> 00:56:16.922
Give me your legs

00:56:17.196 --> 00:56:18.127
Right

00:56:19.163 --> 00:56:19.787
Ready?

00:56:22.995 --> 00:56:23.858
Help!

00:56:30.061 --> 00:56:30.652
Exciting enough?

00:56:30.828 --> 00:56:31.316
Yes

00:56:31.928 --> 00:56:32.417
No more?

00:56:32.894 --> 00:56:33.485
You aren't scared?

00:56:33.694 --> 00:56:34.353
Never

00:56:34.994 --> 00:56:35.960
More moves?

00:56:39.927 --> 00:56:41.790
Just hold tight and

00:56:41.993 --> 00:56:42.720
stay still

00:56:43.093 --> 00:56:44.184
Enjoy the variations

00:56:44.459 --> 00:56:44.823
Really? Okay?

00:56:44.993 --> 00:56:45.549
Okay...

00:56:45.726 --> 00:56:46.384
There

00:56:47.092 --> 00:56:48.648
Run, 1, 2, 3

00:56:57.658 --> 00:57:00.351
Wow! This is fun

00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:04.183
Man's so busy

00:57:04.591 --> 00:57:05.783
Making trash

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.583
The recycling business is a gold mine

00:57:10.189 --> 00:57:10.655
They say...

00:57:10.823 --> 00:57:12.617
What others abandon, I take

00:57:14.123 --> 00:57:15.349
You did well last time

00:57:16.155 --> 00:57:18.678
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:21.554
They all know you're my protégé

00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:22.650
I'm flattered

00:57:22.922 --> 00:57:23.546
Thank you

00:57:24.254 --> 00:57:27.618
Don't thank me, thank yourself

00:57:28.254 --> 00:57:30.651
Any new plans?

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:34.511
I heard you're buying LW's company

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.542
You know

00:57:38.886 --> 00:57:40.681
what's the best win?

00:57:42.852 --> 00:57:45.511
Winning one's battle...

00:57:46.152 --> 00:57:48.709
with the enemy's respect

00:57:55.784 --> 00:57:56.807
Stock Exchange's closed

00:57:56.984 --> 00:57:57.711
And?

00:57:58.617 --> 00:58:01.673
Our stock dropped 20%

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:02.975
Closed at $6.50

00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:07.510
Our drop in asset value?

00:58:08.682 --> 00:58:10.511
Over 2 billion

00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:12.947
It's Chan,

00:58:13.115 --> 00:58:14.240
he's dumping our shares

00:58:16.448 --> 00:58:18.310
What's the news on him?

00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:21.442
Rumors are he wants...

00:58:21.648 --> 00:58:22.943
to buy our company

00:58:23.947 --> 00:58:25.572
Then...

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.807
why dump his shares?

00:58:29.079 --> 00:58:32.636
After buying them so high?

00:58:34.279 --> 00:58:37.541
What's he up to?

00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:39.040
Boss

00:58:44.378 --> 00:58:45.275
What happened to you?

00:58:45.645 --> 00:58:47.167
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

00:58:47.478 --> 00:58:48.307
Was he hurt?

00:58:48.944 --> 00:58:50.341
Not a scratch

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.940
Thank God

00:58:52.377 --> 00:58:53.138
Else...

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:54.503
I'd blame myself

00:58:54.943 --> 00:58:55.966
And if...

00:58:56.143 --> 00:58:58.506
Well,

00:58:58.676 --> 00:58:59.937
you actually were hurt

00:59:01.409 --> 00:59:02.965
And see, I feel guilty

00:59:03.142 --> 00:59:04.698
It was your dad's idea

00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:07.932
He screwed up

00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:10.066
Ordering an ambush

00:59:10.441 --> 00:59:11.963
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:14.735
That's much faster

00:59:15.108 --> 00:59:17.232
Let's do it

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.435
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

00:59:22.773 --> 00:59:24.796
Challenge him openly

00:59:25.906 --> 00:59:27.167
Right

00:59:28.839 --> 00:59:31.862
Yes!

00:59:32.938 --> 00:59:35.234
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.596
Tougher

00:59:39.005 --> 00:59:40.766
Smaller

00:59:41.937 --> 00:59:42.766
And...

00:59:43.237 --> 00:59:44.634
Handsomer than Chan

00:59:45.037 --> 00:59:47.093
He'll be devastated

00:59:55.602 --> 00:59:56.192
What's that?

00:59:57.269 --> 01:00:01.667
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:03.129
Tricky signals

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:14.495
Have you seen her?

01:00:15.799 --> 01:00:17.731
That's Mary

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.990
No, that's Bunny

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:21.357
No, that's Mary

01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:23.930
That's Bunny, come with me

01:00:24.132 --> 01:00:27.063
No, that way

01:00:27.431 --> 01:00:29.021
No

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:31.322
Another Bunny?

01:00:32.098 --> 01:00:33.859
A masseuse

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.720
A masseuse?

01:00:35.997 --> 01:00:36.963
Why not?

01:00:58.628 --> 01:01:00.025
Oh my God, what's he doing?

01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:20.787
Albert!

01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:25.384
Do I look pretty?

01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:26.886
Yes

01:01:29.257 --> 01:01:30.019
What?

01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:32.322
Your outfit

01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:34.579
My Sunday best

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:37.779
Go to...

01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:39.148
Jean-Paul's Boutique

01:01:39.322 --> 01:01:40.618
I'll call him,

01:01:40.855 --> 01:01:42.014
let him dress you

01:01:43.455 --> 01:01:44.921
You feed, shelter,

01:01:45.089 --> 01:01:46.918
and clothe me

01:01:47.088 --> 01:01:47.985
You're my guardian angel

01:01:49.054 --> 01:01:50.111
Your wish is...

01:01:50.421 --> 01:01:52.477
my command

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:53.344
Bye

01:01:55.487 --> 01:01:55.884
What?

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.352
How should I behave at dinner?

01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:01.543
You're playing a gangster's lady

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.083
Use method acting

01:02:07.186 --> 01:02:08.242
Teach me

01:02:08.552 --> 01:02:09.449
Just act snooty

01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:12.008
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

01:02:13.751 --> 01:02:15.774
I'm an angel

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.443
She forgot something?

01:02:22.516 --> 01:02:23.504
Yes?

01:02:25.249 --> 01:02:26.044
Help!

01:02:26.216 --> 01:02:26.977
It's you!

01:02:27.149 --> 01:02:34.047
Where's Bu?

01:02:39.514 --> 01:02:43.139
Please tell me where she is

01:02:55.246 --> 01:02:55.836
Mr. Chan

01:02:56.046 --> 01:02:56.534
Thanks

01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:01.877
Mr. Chan

01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:21.767
What's this?

01:03:22.576 --> 01:03:23.473
Excuse me

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:25.670
The lady's so lovely

01:03:25.909 --> 01:03:28.397
She deserves some wind effect

01:03:30.675 --> 01:03:31.436
You look gorgeous

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:32.435
I know

01:03:43.339 --> 01:03:44.134
Well?

01:03:45.373 --> 01:03:47.430
A vintage wine, from '82

01:03:53.005 --> 01:03:56.494
But I can also tell

01:03:58.072 --> 01:04:00.469
The grape-picker was born in '60

01:04:03.304 --> 01:04:04.065
Let's order

01:04:08.403 --> 01:04:09.334
You order

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.336
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

01:04:16.135 --> 01:04:17.431
Just kidding

01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:18.764
Thank God!

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:26.193
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

01:04:28.867 --> 01:04:30.696
We don't want to be crowded

01:04:36.866 --> 01:04:37.763
Excuse me

01:04:39.933 --> 01:04:41.592
You booked the whole place?

01:04:42.932 --> 01:04:44.522
Just you and me

01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:47.254
I was hoping

01:04:47.498 --> 01:04:49.794
To run into celebrities

01:04:51.231 --> 01:04:52.219
You must really...

01:04:52.398 --> 01:04:53.954
hate crowds

01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:55.391
What about your friends?

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.827
Here comes one

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.752
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

01:05:08.562 --> 01:05:11.790
Why'd you do it?

01:05:12.262 --> 01:05:14.989
Dump my company's shares?

01:05:15.195 --> 01:05:15.956
I'm at dinner,

01:05:16.128 --> 01:05:17.116
call me tomorrow

01:05:19.695 --> 01:05:22.354
You're hurting me

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:24.389
And yourself too

01:05:24.593 --> 01:05:27.559
Mr. Lo, please leave

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:28.889
Sir

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:30.822
You look intelligent

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.584
I am intelligent

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:35.024
Then stay home and think

01:05:35.192 --> 01:05:36.715
Devise a way...

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:38.721
to save your company

01:05:40.425 --> 01:05:41.914
Who are you?

01:05:42.391 --> 01:05:43.448
C.N.'s friend

01:05:43.758 --> 01:05:45.724
He booked the whole place for me

01:05:46.358 --> 01:05:48.324
You're disturbing us

01:05:48.757 --> 01:05:50.950
That's so rude

01:05:54.756 --> 01:05:56.517
Let's talk outside

01:05:57.823 --> 01:05:58.686
We've talked enough

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.485
See you outside

01:06:05.455 --> 01:06:08.852
That signal means "Follow me"

01:06:09.422 --> 01:06:10.410
Wrong again?

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:16.845
You're snooty

01:06:17.654 --> 01:06:19.482
So are my friends

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.016
it rubs off

01:06:24.586 --> 01:06:25.574
You have to go?

01:06:27.886 --> 01:06:30.875
It'll just take a minute

01:06:40.551 --> 01:06:41.346
C.N.

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:44.775
Watch your back

01:06:55.082 --> 01:06:56.309
Watch your back

01:06:57.915 --> 01:06:58.539
I called,

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:01.608
cleared it with your boss

01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:03.480
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

01:07:03.648 --> 01:07:06.409
Close the parking lot for us

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:09.739
Relax, I'm footing the bill

01:07:09.981 --> 01:07:10.571
Fine, Mr. Lo

01:07:11.013 --> 01:07:12.445
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

01:07:15.147 --> 01:07:16.806
Have fun, Mr. Chan

01:07:18.713 --> 01:07:19.303
LW

01:07:20.179 --> 01:07:21.042
What's up?

01:07:21.513 --> 01:07:23.206
I want you to meet someone

01:07:23.578 --> 01:07:25.237
I hired him from overseas

01:07:26.445 --> 01:07:27.342
Ladies and gentlemen

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.041
Alan

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:39.065
An undefeated light-weight champion

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:43.874
He'll fight you one-on-one

01:07:45.676 --> 01:07:46.937
But...

01:07:47.143 --> 01:07:48.506
I'm a middle-weight

01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:50.199
Too much of an edge

01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:53.669
But if you lose

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:57.269
Think of the disgrace

01:07:59.007 --> 01:08:01.564
Grow up

01:08:01.807 --> 01:08:02.830
Nuts

01:08:03.907 --> 01:08:04.736
Play this music for me

01:08:04.907 --> 01:08:05.804
No problem

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.364
You have no choice

01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:02.989
Why the gloves?

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:05.356
This is a boxing match

01:09:05.599 --> 01:09:06.565
I'm not...

01:09:06.766 --> 01:09:07.424
into crippling people

01:09:08.033 --> 01:09:09.623
With gloves, it won't hurt?

01:09:10.265 --> 01:09:12.094
Sure it'll hurt

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:13.958
But much less

01:09:18.398 --> 01:09:19.489
All set

01:09:20.264 --> 01:09:20.922
Watch your head

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:23.989
Music

01:09:24.764 --> 01:09:26.229
Knock me down anyway you can

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:28.953
But no dirty tricks

01:09:32.162 --> 01:09:34.821
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:41.590
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

01:09:47.128 --> 01:09:48.094
You ask for it

01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:50.349
Are you ready?

01:09:50.527 --> 01:09:51.151
Of course

01:09:55.027 --> 01:09:55.720
Alan's losing big time

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.457
No, Alan's just testing him

01:09:58.759 --> 01:10:00.248
He's wearing Chan down

01:10:15.224 --> 01:10:18.519
Wait Good

01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:28.347
Changing gloves, why?

01:10:28.922 --> 01:10:29.887
Even the odds

01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:31.719
Bigger the glove,

01:10:31.955 --> 01:10:33.182
bigger the handicap

01:10:33.588 --> 01:10:36.179
Chan's punches are soft

01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:43.247
I've come a long way,

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.042
I don't want a short game

01:10:48.552 --> 01:10:49.518
Every boxer trains...

01:10:49.853 --> 01:10:50.876
to his own music

01:10:51.053 --> 01:10:51.916
When he fights,

01:10:52.119 --> 01:10:53.779
it give him rhythm

01:10:54.152 --> 01:10:55.811
And rhythm paces his steps

01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:01.710
Chan has no rhythm

01:11:02.251 --> 01:11:04.183
He's controlled by Alan

01:11:05.417 --> 01:11:06.314
You're an expert

01:11:06.484 --> 01:11:07.041
You should be fighting

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:08.074
Right

01:11:08.584 --> 01:11:10.311
C.N. And I used to box

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.812
But I always lost

01:11:12.317 --> 01:11:13.509
So I quit and became a...

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:14.741
Commentator

01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:15.574
Wow!

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:17.281
You like that better?

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.474
Sure. I sound so invincible

01:11:20.715 --> 01:11:22.113
But I'm just like you guys

01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:24.205
Helpless

01:11:31.948 --> 01:11:34.140
Chan used to have brilliant moves

01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:35.210
Now he's a mess

01:11:36.513 --> 01:11:39.308
Buying companies...

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.241
instead of training

01:11:40.413 --> 01:11:42.402
Loser!

01:12:11.342 --> 01:12:14.570
Chan's nervous, it's over

01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:22.592
Good hit, but not enough power

01:13:41.031 --> 01:13:41.928
Come on

01:14:22.326 --> 01:14:23.313
You okay?

01:14:24.959 --> 01:14:25.925
You win

01:14:28.758 --> 01:14:30.849
We won

01:14:31.192 --> 01:14:33.555
Let's kick him while he's down

01:14:33.858 --> 01:14:34.982
Good idea

01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:40.050
Don't be...

01:14:40.657 --> 01:14:42.486
such cowards

01:14:43.256 --> 01:14:44.619
Ganging up on a downed man

01:14:44.789 --> 01:14:46.721
There's no honor in that

01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.916
You're good

01:14:55.888 --> 01:14:56.512
Get the car

01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:05.216
My joy is done. He's good

01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:13.814
C.N., you okay?

01:15:16.286 --> 01:15:17.945
You must be delighted

01:15:19.452 --> 01:15:22.384
No, but I thought I would be

01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:28.083
You need help?

01:15:32.117 --> 01:15:32.912
Damn it

01:15:38.183 --> 01:15:40.671
C.N., call me

01:16:15.545 --> 01:16:16.272
You didn't leave?

01:16:16.778 --> 01:16:18.243
You asked me to wait

01:16:19.044 --> 01:16:21.407
I came to find you

01:16:23.777 --> 01:16:26.265
Did they gang up on you?

01:16:26.577 --> 01:16:29.633
No, one-on-one, I lost

01:16:31.043 --> 01:16:34.304
You'll get used to it

01:16:36.109 --> 01:16:37.166
Just kidding

01:16:37.976 --> 01:16:41.339
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

01:16:42.741 --> 01:16:46.105
I'll train, but not for them

01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:48.567
For what then?

01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:53.463
A strong body, a quick mind

01:16:54.873 --> 01:16:56.600
I haven't trained in ages

01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:01.103
Your huge gym, what a waste

01:17:02.973 --> 01:17:04.268
I hate training alone

01:17:06.972 --> 01:17:08.961
I'll join you

01:17:11.705 --> 01:17:12.693
Why be so nice to me?

01:17:13.937 --> 01:17:15.062
You're rich

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:19.126
You're cute when you smile

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.635
You looked grouchy just now

01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:25.727
That's why you lost

01:17:26.536 --> 01:17:27.900
Stick with smiling

01:17:29.369 --> 01:17:31.926
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.700
Take tomorrow off

01:17:37.968 --> 01:17:38.626
Why?

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:40.261
Say yes first

01:17:40.467 --> 01:17:40.865
Why?

01:17:41.234 --> 01:17:42.358
Say yes first

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.491
Yes, now why?

01:17:45.866 --> 01:17:46.627
Play!

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:51.198
Memories are so many

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.424
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

01:17:56.999 --> 01:18:01.363
I sketch a hazy future

01:18:02.298 --> 01:18:06.696
Knowing this illusion is love

01:18:07.064 --> 01:18:11.360
The tides of a lifetime

01:18:11.897 --> 01:18:16.591
Widen the shores slowly

01:18:17.029 --> 01:18:21.518
Quietly you and I meet

01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:27.120
Our love proves life is ever changing

01:18:28.262 --> 01:18:33.421
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:18:33.595 --> 01:18:38.390
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.390
Like eternity

01:18:42.393 --> 01:18:46.983
Is the night really still young?

01:18:48.426 --> 01:18:53.585
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

01:18:53.758 --> 01:18:58.587
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:58.757 --> 01:19:02.553
I can think no more

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:04.919
But this love

01:19:05.623 --> 01:19:09.919
Links the sea with the sky

01:19:33.687 --> 01:19:37.948
My eyes have been raining

01:19:38.686 --> 01:19:43.015
I can't hold on with both hands

01:19:43.586 --> 01:19:47.813
I cry as we seek happiness

01:19:48.251 --> 01:19:53.411
You're just like a shooting star

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:58.148
Those happy moments

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:03.443
Lock you between my brows

01:20:03.816 --> 01:20:08.145
No matter how the world dazzles

01:20:08.748 --> 01:20:13.908
It pales next to your eternal splendor

01:20:14.748 --> 01:20:20.270
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:20:20.447 --> 01:20:25.038
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:20:25.213 --> 01:20:28.269
Like eternity

01:20:29.379 --> 01:20:33.970
Is the night really still young?

01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:35.407
You love me?

01:20:38.045 --> 01:20:38.976
I think you're quite...

01:20:39.145 --> 01:20:41.508
Answer the question

01:20:42.711 --> 01:20:43.472
The fact is...

01:20:43.644 --> 01:20:45.576
C'mon

01:20:46.277 --> 01:20:49.368
Answer in 4 words or less

01:20:49.877 --> 01:20:52.968
I love you

01:20:54.109 --> 01:20:56.734
Or I don't

01:21:18.138 --> 01:21:20.366
When did you slip in?

01:21:20.604 --> 01:21:24.730
I'm in love

01:21:24.904 --> 01:21:30.302
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

01:21:30.836 --> 01:21:35.893
So don't get fooled by love

01:21:37.735 --> 01:21:40.826
You're such an optimist

01:21:43.034 --> 01:21:44.863
I have news for you

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.195
What?

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.661
Longyi's here

01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:51.996
He almost strangled me

01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:54.491
But I calmed him down

01:21:54.967 --> 01:21:56.523
He's been drunk ever since

01:21:57.866 --> 01:21:59.526
My fault

01:21:59.799 --> 01:22:03.561
No way

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:06.730
Listen, love is not sympathy

01:22:07.098 --> 01:22:09.155
You're tangled up...

01:22:09.332 --> 01:22:10.319
with Chan

01:22:10.498 --> 01:22:11.486
Don't let Longyi see you

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:18.928
Wine please No

01:22:19.097 --> 01:22:20.323
Wait

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:21.493
Let go

01:22:21.963 --> 01:22:22.622
No

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:23.820
Kitchen time

01:22:23.996 --> 01:22:24.552
Kitchen

01:22:26.829 --> 01:22:27.852
I need...

01:22:32.495 --> 01:22:33.325
What?

01:22:33.895 --> 01:22:34.758
I...

01:22:35.129 --> 01:22:37.219
I need a glass

01:22:37.394 --> 01:22:38.791
I'll get it

01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:41.253
Go inside

01:22:42.927 --> 01:22:44.051
No pushing

01:22:46.926 --> 01:22:49.222
Albert

01:22:51.893 --> 01:22:53.222
Where's the opener?

01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:57.454
Albert

01:22:59.258 --> 01:23:00.189
Smooth move

01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:02.984
So cold!

01:23:03.158 --> 01:23:04.055
Albert

01:23:06.324 --> 01:23:07.381
Now what?

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:11.620
I need the opener

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:16.613
Where is it?

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:18.217
Hurry!

01:23:23.856 --> 01:23:24.753
What's that?

01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:29.087
The family above us

01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:30.743
Has a brat

01:23:31.954 --> 01:23:33.420
It's from above us?

01:23:34.588 --> 01:23:36.951
Where else?

01:23:51.219 --> 01:23:52.650
It's from above us

01:23:53.418 --> 01:23:56.009
It's that brat again

01:23:57.084 --> 01:23:58.311
Opener

01:23:58.917 --> 01:23:59.712
Forget it

01:24:01.984 --> 01:24:03.915
Drink it this way

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:06.543
Wait Come

01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:08.548
Drink with me

01:24:11.716 --> 01:24:12.374
You okay?

01:24:12.716 --> 01:24:16.079
I must tell C.N.

01:24:16.249 --> 01:24:17.475
A game...

01:24:17.648 --> 01:24:18.807
is fun

01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:21.243
Till its secret is revealed

01:24:21.648 --> 01:24:25.340
I know he loves me

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.812
He skips work to be with me

01:24:30.147 --> 01:24:33.170
I miss him day and night

01:24:33.813 --> 01:24:36.108
I'm like a child again

01:24:36.346 --> 01:24:39.278
Getting so attached to him

01:24:40.012 --> 01:24:41.773
I see something beautiful

01:24:42.145 --> 01:24:43.805
I want it for him

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:47.642
Something happens, I want to tell him

01:24:48.078 --> 01:24:51.339
I'm so happy

01:24:51.877 --> 01:24:52.639
And...

01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:53.637
so cold!

01:24:54.377 --> 01:24:55.933
You're in love

01:24:59.176 --> 01:24:59.835
Need something?

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:01.703
Sake

01:25:02.043 --> 01:25:03.168
Finish your wine first

01:25:03.343 --> 01:25:04.933
I want sake

01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:07.468
Just wait outside Sake

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.035
Hang on

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:14.970
Excuse me

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.171
Let's sing

01:25:25.373 --> 01:25:27.429
This is not a Karaoke bar

01:25:28.439 --> 01:25:29.735
We don't have time

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:30.962
We'll split this

01:25:31.139 --> 01:25:31.696
Too much

01:25:31.972 --> 01:25:33.370
Not at all

01:25:33.638 --> 01:25:34.899
Enough

01:25:36.538 --> 01:25:37.765
Cheers

01:25:39.871 --> 01:25:42.337
You'll get drunk

01:25:44.504 --> 01:25:46.527
Drink it

01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:52.497
1... 2... 3...

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:53.601
Down!

01:26:05.268 --> 01:26:06.460
Still kicking. Thank God

01:26:27.399 --> 01:26:29.126
She's safe here

01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:35.692
Here she is

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:49.818
Gloria, Bu

01:26:50.196 --> 01:26:51.253
Gloria's a good friend

01:26:52.563 --> 01:26:54.391
She's the one impersonating me?

01:26:54.862 --> 01:26:55.259
Yes!

01:26:55.428 --> 01:26:56.325
Not bad

01:27:01.395 --> 01:27:03.417
You knew all along

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.319
Why con me?

01:27:08.726 --> 01:27:09.885
You started it

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.017
All the love I felt between us

01:27:15.193 --> 01:27:19.818
That was just an act?

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:22.614
Our happiness was no act

01:27:23.459 --> 01:27:24.447
If you like,

01:27:25.258 --> 01:27:26.655
stay in Hong Kong

01:27:28.257 --> 01:27:29.621
What am I?

01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:32.884
One of your women?

01:27:37.824 --> 01:27:40.381
The bottle sent me to you

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:44.619
A fairy tale becomes...

01:27:46.422 --> 01:27:48.081
a nightmare

01:28:05.453 --> 01:28:06.680
My big mouth

01:28:07.486 --> 01:28:08.543
No

01:28:09.419 --> 01:28:10.407
Get her back

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:11.241
No

01:28:16.019 --> 01:28:18.143
Weren't we on the same plane?

01:28:20.051 --> 01:28:20.948
Back to Taiwan?

01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:21.706
Yes

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.273
You had fun?

01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:24.878
It was okay

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.080
I bought a lot,

01:28:27.317 --> 01:28:28.283
what about you?

01:28:30.316 --> 01:28:31.509
I...

01:28:31.917 --> 01:28:33.212
I bought a story

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:34.911
A story!

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:36.445
Is it in an office building?

01:28:50.381 --> 01:28:51.176
The government passed a law...

01:28:51.347 --> 01:28:52.937
prohibiting the use...

01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:54.572
of non-bio-degradable

01:28:54.747 --> 01:28:56.679
styrofoam

01:28:57.046 --> 01:28:57.740
LW's stock...

01:28:57.913 --> 01:29:00.970
dropped drastically

01:29:01.479 --> 01:29:03.877
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

01:29:04.245 --> 01:29:05.767
Major stockholders,

01:29:05.945 --> 01:29:07.206
are dumping them

01:29:07.512 --> 01:29:08.136
You knew...

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:10.209
the law would be passed?

01:29:11.545 --> 01:29:13.306
It was only a matter of time

01:29:13.478 --> 01:29:15.307
Should we borrow money?

01:29:15.478 --> 01:29:16.773
Up to you guys

01:29:17.211 --> 01:29:17.835
Mr. Chan,

01:29:18.011 --> 01:29:20.408
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:22.573
Just to...

01:29:22.743 --> 01:29:23.674
get even

01:29:23.976 --> 01:29:25.237
I won't

01:29:26.543 --> 01:29:27.668
That's all for today

01:29:27.843 --> 01:29:28.399
The acquisition...

01:29:28.576 --> 01:29:30.565
is a go?

01:29:30.875 --> 01:29:31.533
I'll let you know

01:30:47.298 --> 01:30:56.821
Love is like falling maples

01:30:58.630 --> 01:30:59.255
Like what?

01:31:00.463 --> 01:31:05.327
Like falling maples

01:31:05.496 --> 01:31:07.086
What does that mean?

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:08.758
I don't know

01:31:11.095 --> 01:31:13.617
I've never seen you like this

01:31:13.795 --> 01:31:15.352
Paper everywhere

01:31:16.095 --> 01:31:17.560
Just do...

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:19.626
what you have to do

01:31:20.328 --> 01:31:20.986
Again?

01:31:21.528 --> 01:31:22.652
Forget it

01:31:23.961 --> 01:31:24.517
What?

01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:26.256
Nothing

01:31:26.493 --> 01:31:27.981
Leave me alone

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:34.483
Fine, be that way

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:38.919
You broke it?

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:39.950
Good guess

01:31:41.358 --> 01:31:41.847
Sir

01:31:42.024 --> 01:31:42.820
Call 911

01:31:43.124 --> 01:31:44.112
They'll stop me

01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.116
Just call

01:31:54.723 --> 01:31:56.416
See

01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:57.385
What do you want?

01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:58.914
You ruined our boss,

01:31:59.189 --> 01:32:00.120
lost us our jobs

01:32:00.922 --> 01:32:02.411
We came for payback

01:32:04.922 --> 01:32:06.148
Mr. Chan

01:32:08.288 --> 01:32:09.844
I heard you're back in training

01:32:10.088 --> 01:32:10.644
Yes, I am

01:32:11.088 --> 01:32:11.815
Rematch?

01:32:12.321 --> 01:32:13.344
Mr. Lo sent you?

01:32:13.588 --> 01:32:14.554
Mr. Lo is broke

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:16.582
It's not about money

01:32:18.354 --> 01:32:19.785
Not now

01:32:20.753 --> 01:32:21.878
You got no choice

01:32:25.819 --> 01:32:27.910
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

01:32:29.385 --> 01:32:30.783
Only with the best

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:40.708
What are they talking about?

01:32:41.251 --> 01:32:42.648
You never learned English...

01:32:42.817 --> 01:32:43.612
in school?

01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:44.714
C'mon, tell me

01:32:45.784 --> 01:32:46.306
No

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.379
Okay

01:32:57.449 --> 01:32:58.210
Rules?

01:32:58.381 --> 01:32:59.278
No rules

01:33:01.515 --> 01:33:05.140
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:14.940
You like white

01:33:25.378 --> 01:33:26.207
Are you sure?

01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:28.774
I'm sure

01:34:50.968 --> 01:34:51.797
Good training

01:35:46.928 --> 01:35:47.984
Wait

01:36:09.724 --> 01:36:10.712
Now what?

01:36:12.157 --> 01:36:14.146
"What's you okay?" In English?

01:36:14.623 --> 01:36:15.816
Are you okay?

01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:17.485
Are you okay?

01:36:19.889 --> 01:36:20.820
Okay

01:36:39.321 --> 01:36:40.116
Pretty good

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.415
I'm coming

01:37:49.145 --> 01:37:49.838
Ready?

01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:20.768
Come on

01:38:24.307 --> 01:38:26.739
Smile, don't worry

01:39:04.536 --> 01:39:05.433
Are you ready?

01:39:23.866 --> 01:39:25.764
Come on

01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:31.954
Don't worry, be happy

01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:08.649
Let's dance

01:41:31.284 --> 01:41:31.977
Let's finish

01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:54.298
Get up

01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:55.437
On your feet

01:43:02.072 --> 01:43:03.060
You okay?

01:43:14.338 --> 01:43:15.099
Yes

01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:17.800
You won

01:43:18.137 --> 01:43:18.728
I lost

01:43:19.437 --> 01:43:19.993
Why?

01:43:20.836 --> 01:43:21.563
Pound for pound

01:43:21.736 --> 01:43:24.202
He'd have beaten me in no time

01:43:25.336 --> 01:43:26.427
See if he's all right

01:43:29.868 --> 01:43:30.925
You smell turpentine?

01:43:31.302 --> 01:43:32.733
The boss is setting a fire

01:43:34.802 --> 01:43:36.028
Fantastic

01:43:36.834 --> 01:43:37.857
But we'll go to jail

01:43:38.034 --> 01:43:38.931
Prison!

01:43:40.034 --> 01:43:41.522
This is nuts

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:42.966
Watch it

01:43:43.833 --> 01:43:45.026
No sweat

01:43:45.733 --> 01:43:47.824
Hey, jail sucks, boss

01:43:49.633 --> 01:43:54.462
You checked there's nobody inside?

01:43:54.699 --> 01:43:55.824
Sure did

01:43:55.999 --> 01:43:57.056
Good

01:43:57.598 --> 01:44:00.393
Give this to dad

01:44:00.831 --> 01:44:02.694
Tell him I love him

01:44:03.631 --> 01:44:05.426
Give this to C.N.

01:44:05.664 --> 01:44:08.596
Tell him I hate him

01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:11.457
This is for the cops

01:44:11.964 --> 01:44:14.293
I'm claiming all responsibility

01:44:14.596 --> 01:44:16.528
Really?

01:44:16.696 --> 01:44:17.787
You're going to jail, not us?

01:44:21.929 --> 01:44:23.019
Me neither

01:44:24.895 --> 01:44:26.225
Stand aside

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.822
C.N. And I go down together

01:44:29.994 --> 01:44:31.620
Don't do it, boss

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.450
My eyes hurt

01:44:35.493 --> 01:44:37.220
But so what?

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:38.787
I'm going to die anyway

01:44:40.226 --> 01:44:42.555
Bye, Mary

01:44:46.326 --> 01:44:47.848
Calm down, LW

01:44:48.492 --> 01:44:51.946
It's all your fault

01:44:52.191 --> 01:44:53.248
You took it too far

01:44:53.625 --> 01:44:55.022
Dad kicked me off the Board

01:44:55.224 --> 01:44:57.281
I have nothing now

01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:58.582
I'm finished

01:44:59.657 --> 01:45:01.748
What about us, boss?

01:45:01.957 --> 01:45:03.150
Are we finished too?

01:45:03.656 --> 01:45:04.145
You're asking me?

01:45:04.324 --> 01:45:05.381
Yes

01:45:06.190 --> 01:45:07.212
Shut up

01:45:09.656 --> 01:45:10.951
Boss

01:45:12.689 --> 01:45:13.450
Okay now?

01:45:13.622 --> 01:45:14.451
Warmer still

01:45:15.655 --> 01:45:16.211
How's that?

01:45:16.522 --> 01:45:17.317
Just right

01:45:19.092 --> 01:45:19.989
Your eyes still hurt?

01:45:22.459 --> 01:45:23.550
Why be so nice to me?

01:45:23.892 --> 01:45:24.721
You wanted to ruin me

01:45:26.559 --> 01:45:27.217
Styrofoam's bad...

01:45:27.392 --> 01:45:29.414
for the environment

01:45:30.058 --> 01:45:31.853
It needs to be regulated

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:34.819
That motivated my acquisition

01:45:35.224 --> 01:45:36.519
Let's be partners

01:45:36.824 --> 01:45:39.756
In recycling paper

01:45:41.257 --> 01:45:42.745
That's not like you

01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:44.922
Ever since grade school

01:45:45.257 --> 01:45:46.517
You've had to beat me

01:45:47.156 --> 01:45:48.850
In whatever we do

01:45:49.056 --> 01:45:51.113
You stole my girlfriends

01:45:51.656 --> 01:45:54.554
And then dumped them

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:55.711
Never really loved them

01:45:56.423 --> 01:45:57.286
I hated you so

01:45:58.289 --> 01:45:59.516
I hated you too

01:46:00.022 --> 01:46:01.578
Really? What for?

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:02.643
For always laughing

01:46:03.255 --> 01:46:04.914
For being born so rich

01:46:05.988 --> 01:46:07.079
For your name

01:46:07.555 --> 01:46:09.645
Low Wow is a stupid name

01:46:11.122 --> 01:46:12.451
I hated you most

01:46:12.722 --> 01:46:14.914
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

01:46:16.235 --> 01:46:18.030
So it boils down to Ann

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.459
But she dumped me

01:46:24.967 --> 01:46:26.865
She married that...

01:46:27.034 --> 01:46:30.363
Andy Law Andy Law

01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.583
That nerd

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:34.551
So dull

01:46:38.819 --> 01:46:40.046
We fought for so many years

01:46:41.053 --> 01:46:43.109
But we each haven't committed

01:46:43.752 --> 01:46:45.513
To loving only one woman

01:46:45.918 --> 01:46:48.713
But what about Mary?

01:46:48.885 --> 01:46:49.942
She's nothing

01:46:50.384 --> 01:46:51.441
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

01:46:52.284 --> 01:46:53.772
Weren't you engaged?

01:46:53.851 --> 01:46:54.874
What happened?

01:46:57.051 --> 01:46:59.107
I copped out

01:47:02.150 --> 01:47:03.740
but she's one great dame

01:47:04.173 --> 01:47:08.036
We were so happy together

01:47:08.716 --> 01:47:11.681
Laughing all day long

01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:16.205
Wish I could turn the clock back

01:47:18.614 --> 01:47:21.546
But she moved overseas

01:47:22.914 --> 01:47:24.504
I lost track of her

01:47:27.247 --> 01:47:29.405
What's wrong?

01:47:32.113 --> 01:47:32.942
See you later

01:47:34.246 --> 01:47:37.643
Did I say something?

01:47:42.379 --> 01:47:43.174
Skipper

01:47:44.046 --> 01:47:44.943
Your Bu is back

01:47:45.312 --> 01:47:49.574
Yes, she is. Cheers

01:47:49.945 --> 01:47:53.536
Skipper, cheers

01:48:05.909 --> 01:48:06.738
What's that?

01:48:08.576 --> 01:48:09.633
Going to college?

01:48:10.975 --> 01:48:12.168
Considering it

01:48:15.409 --> 01:48:16.567
You've changed

01:48:18.141 --> 01:48:20.573
Love changes people

01:48:23.941 --> 01:48:25.304
Don't rush...

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.269
to forget him

01:48:29.673 --> 01:48:32.003
Or it'll get worse

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.062
One day

01:48:34.673 --> 01:48:36.036
You take a shower

01:48:36.206 --> 01:48:36.864
Listen to music

01:48:37.606 --> 01:48:39.503
And suddenly remember him

01:48:40.505 --> 01:48:43.266
Then you've forgotten him

01:48:48.138 --> 01:48:50.069
You're pretty when you smile

01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:54.765
Bu

01:48:58.803 --> 01:48:59.530
Albert

01:48:59.703 --> 01:49:01.032
Where have you been?

01:49:01.602 --> 01:49:03.465
I was so worried

01:49:08.368 --> 01:49:09.527
You're not...

01:49:09.901 --> 01:49:11.299
really my type

01:49:14.835 --> 01:49:17.062
I like older men

01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:18.597
I'm older than you

01:49:20.834 --> 01:49:22.094
I mean here

01:49:23.099 --> 01:49:24.030
Here?

01:49:24.833 --> 01:49:26.458
If I were your girl

01:49:26.766 --> 01:49:28.595
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:33.725
You'll get it

01:49:34.132 --> 01:49:34.893
I miss you so

01:49:35.299 --> 01:49:36.628
I was so worried about you

01:49:38.464 --> 01:49:40.191
This must be your mother

01:49:40.664 --> 01:49:41.323
This is...

01:49:41.697 --> 01:49:43.822
Albert, my pal

01:49:47.463 --> 01:49:50.553
Can you be my adopted brother?

01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:52.352
Good idea

01:49:52.696 --> 01:49:53.593
I'm the adopted mother?

01:49:54.696 --> 01:49:55.457
Wait

01:49:57.162 --> 01:49:58.593
Why not? Mom

01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.694
Son

01:50:00.195 --> 01:50:00.661
Mom

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:03.350
My Albert

01:50:03.528 --> 01:50:03.959
Mom

01:50:36.057 --> 01:50:37.148
Bu! Bu!

01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:38.149
I missed you

01:50:40.123 --> 01:50:41.453
You miss me?

01:50:47.255 --> 01:50:48.186
Come back

01:50:49.055 --> 01:50:49.783
Bu!

01:50:52.655 --> 01:50:53.484
Bu!

01:51:25.051 --> 01:51:25.948
Bu!

01:51:28.551 --> 01:51:29.209
Scram

01:51:29.917 --> 01:51:32.008
It's you who bullied my daughter

01:51:32.184 --> 01:51:32.945
No, I didn't

01:51:33.284 --> 01:51:34.147
You did too

01:51:34.817 --> 01:51:37.839
She used to laugh all the time

01:51:38.216 --> 01:51:40.909
Now she hardly smiles

01:51:41.283 --> 01:51:44.180
My heart aches for her

01:51:44.749 --> 01:51:47.237
What did you do to her?

01:51:47.815 --> 01:51:49.338
Nothing

01:51:49.614 --> 01:51:51.341
Then why is she like this?

01:51:51.948 --> 01:51:53.675
Please let me talk to her

01:51:53.914 --> 01:51:55.607
Just...

01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.837
leave her alone

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:00.544
I don't speak Taiwanese

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.541
He said leave her alone

01:52:02.712 --> 01:52:03.643
Beat it

01:52:07.046 --> 01:52:07.602
Bu!

01:52:09.345 --> 01:52:10.208
Bu!

01:52:10.845 --> 01:52:11.334
Get lost

01:52:11.512 --> 01:52:12.000
Bu

01:52:12.245 --> 01:52:12.710
Hit the road

01:52:14.145 --> 01:52:14.667
I...

01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:31.571
It's all right

01:52:42.008 --> 01:52:43.598
You bullied my niece

01:53:01.572 --> 01:53:02.196
Sir

01:53:13.604 --> 01:53:15.069
I'll just sit here

01:53:15.603 --> 01:53:17.069
Don't walk past me

01:53:18.236 --> 01:53:20.498
You dad's a cool dude

01:53:24.836 --> 01:53:27.358
Sir, you okay?

01:53:28.335 --> 01:53:29.232
Are you hurt?

01:53:29.602 --> 01:53:31.760
Leave us alone

01:53:32.635 --> 01:53:33.965
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

01:53:34.134 --> 01:53:36.066
Waste of time

01:53:36.468 --> 01:53:37.728
Bu, I...

01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:39.060
Shut up

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.293
Bu!

01:53:43.567 --> 01:53:44.396
Shut up

01:53:45.799 --> 01:53:46.322
Bu!

01:53:46.632 --> 01:53:47.257
Shut up

01:53:48.666 --> 01:53:49.155
Bu!

01:53:51.032 --> 01:53:52.396
I'm warning you

01:53:53.065 --> 01:53:53.894
Either you kill me

01:53:54.865 --> 01:53:56.263
Or let me talk to her

01:54:00.598 --> 01:54:03.961
All right, come

01:54:05.464 --> 01:54:07.521
Speak up

01:54:09.896 --> 01:54:13.794
Now or never

01:54:14.162 --> 01:54:15.560
Don't disturb them

01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:16.956
I want to hear

01:54:24.095 --> 01:54:24.992
Why bother?

01:54:29.494 --> 01:54:31.050
You left these

01:54:33.394 --> 01:54:34.620
I have plenty

01:54:40.026 --> 01:54:41.924
I brought Chinese pot rice

01:54:43.592 --> 01:54:45.524
It's cold, but it's your favorite

01:54:49.325 --> 01:54:53.256
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

01:54:56.558 --> 01:54:58.114
There's more

01:55:07.789 --> 01:55:09.220
I put a note in each one

01:55:10.322 --> 01:55:11.379
Saying what?

01:55:12.456 --> 01:55:14.546
I love you, I miss you

01:55:15.155 --> 01:55:16.518
Never over 4 words

01:55:17.022 --> 01:55:18.351
took me hours

01:55:20.854 --> 01:55:22.286
Too much work

01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:24.480
Just put $1,000 in each

01:55:24.854 --> 01:55:25.979
And you have me

01:55:39.086 --> 01:55:41.415
So do you love me?

01:55:42.618 --> 01:55:43.379
I love you

01:55:45.185 --> 01:55:46.741
Since when?

01:55:47.718 --> 01:55:49.274
Since you stole my name-card

01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:53.212
What wish did you make...

01:55:53.384 --> 01:55:54.576
on the boat?

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:58.738
It's already come true

01:56:02.716 --> 01:56:04.545
Why do you cry?

01:56:07.482 --> 01:56:08.448
Kiss her

01:56:09.449 --> 01:56:11.676
Kiss her

01:56:11.915 --> 01:56:13.847
I'll say it in Cantonese

01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:15.569
Kiss her

01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:25.741
You're...

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.238
Xiaojun

01:56:27.612 --> 01:56:29.271
Do I know you?

01:56:30.079 --> 01:56:31.443
I'm your neighbor

01:56:31.912 --> 01:56:33.741
Wow, fantastic!

01:56:34.145 --> 01:56:34.701
Why?

01:56:35.845 --> 01:56:36.833
Oh, weather is fine

01:56:51.609 --> 01:56:52.597
Look at them

01:57:07.008 --> 01:57:08.598
The women here are gorgeous

01:57:08.808 --> 01:57:09.239
I should have...

01:57:09.407 --> 01:57:10.100
Go to hell

01:57:10.674 --> 01:57:13.162
I want you to meet my dolphin

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:14.129
Really?

01:57:14.406 --> 01:57:17.167
Bu! Bu!

01:57:17.406 --> 01:57:18.167
Wow!
