00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:11.942
100 years ago,

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:15.808
this island in Taiwan...

00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:17.043
had nothing

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.010
Only romance

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.344
Legend has it

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.370
There were two lovers

00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:28.344
And one day

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.668
The man was fishing

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.111
His boat sank

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:37.207
The woman...

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:39.836
saw it onshore

00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:42.009
She swam out

00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:46.373
No one ever saw them again

00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:47.904
Some say

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.108
they became dolphins

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:55.838
All dolphins around this island...

00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.942
came from them

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:10.964
They all make...

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.799
"Bu... Bu" noises

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:29.531
Nice story?

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.566
So snooty

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:41.025
You told a horror story

00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:45.367
Don't get involved

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.902
Have some melon

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.463
No

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:51.492
You're like...

00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:53.100
those dolphins

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.757
So picky

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.126
You named me Bu

00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:02.160
I've told you so often

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.796
Don't mix Mandarin...

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:06.126
with Cantonese

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.595
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.823
are now both accented

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:16.823
You teach her Mandarin then

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.826
Get off my case

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.625
That's Cantonese again

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:25.795
Which I don't speak

00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:29.490
What did you say?

00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:32.225
Tell me

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:37.522
Skipper Restaurant

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.224
Open bar, folks

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.549
One more round

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.985
Drink up

00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:14.555
Go in and take a seat

00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:18.055
Long time no see

00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:26.148
One more round?

00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:27.914
Not tonight

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:29.712
Can't afford it

00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:32.488
On the house

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.677
Bu, 6 beers, on me

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.314
They come everyday

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:40.454
Never pay

00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:42.050
Add water...

00:04:42.222 --> 00:04:43.449
to the beer

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:46.552
That trick again?

00:04:46.855 --> 00:04:48.377
Bu Yes?

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:49.951
Hurry

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:51.884
Here

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:53.747
Did you add water?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.943
No!

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.946
No, very good

00:04:57.453 --> 00:04:58.419
C'mon

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:02.109
Cheers

00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:13.450
Why, Bu?

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:16.440
Idiot

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.410
You could've spared me

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:24.445
They sing

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.806
Watch TV

00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:29.512
Or pick fights

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:31.844
This island

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:33.605
Has no room...

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:35.036
for romance

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:57.642
Done

00:05:58.545 --> 00:05:59.476
Beautiful

00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:00.338
I learned it...

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:01.909
from a magazine

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:08.808
Bu

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.236
I brought you something

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:16.464
I've never seen...

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.708
an oyster this big

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:22.499
Any pearls?

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.175
No

00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:30.106
Must be expensive

00:06:30.508 --> 00:06:31.599
NT$3,000

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:35.869
Thanks

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.404
And this

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.603
It's my friend's shop

00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:43.997
He'll give us a discount

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:45.865
I'm...

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:48.396
Proposing?

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.264
No, I just want to...

00:06:51.438 --> 00:06:52.699
Yes, I'm proposing

00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:55.895
With...

00:06:56.071 --> 00:06:57.900
a big oyster?

00:06:58.205 --> 00:06:59.228
Of course not

00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:00.700
The oyster's not...

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.331
Marry me

00:07:05.837 --> 00:07:06.598
Okay

00:07:09.203 --> 00:07:10.362
I'll consider it

00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:26.193
Poor Longyi

00:07:26.434 --> 00:07:27.797
This oyster's not cheap

00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:31.626
He proposed to me

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:33.959
Really?

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.090
You love him?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.995
Well, he's actually...

00:07:40.732 --> 00:07:41.992
Not bad

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:44.160
Your answer

00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:45.729
Shouldn't be over 4 words

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.488
You love him, or you don't

00:08:02.163 --> 00:08:04.685
You left Hong Kong...

00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:06.123
to marry dad, why?

00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:08.650
He was quite a hunk

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.717
A good cook too

00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:14.451
You're a good cook

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.053
He's better

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.290
He cooks with love

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.022
What's loving someone like?

00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:32.586
You miss him

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:36.185
The sight of him thrills you

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:37.816
You ache

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:40.324
When he's gone

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.185
You could watch him forever

00:08:46.824 --> 00:08:48.381
Even when he's sleeping

00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:51.379
You're in love

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.921
If you feel like that

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:55.618
Okay?

00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:11.776
You miss Hong Kong?

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:15.551
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

00:09:16.053 --> 00:09:16.747
I see

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.947
You don't love Longyi

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.709
Take mama's advice

00:09:24.352 --> 00:09:26.215
Trust your heart

00:09:26.685 --> 00:09:28.981
Do what you have to do

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:37.277
Bu

00:09:50.283 --> 00:09:51.805
Hey, kid

00:09:53.183 --> 00:09:54.978
Got some news

00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:57.539
Longyi proposed

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.408
Don't laugh

00:10:03.881 --> 00:10:06.244
Somebody said

00:10:07.181 --> 00:10:11.545
Men and women...

00:10:12.647 --> 00:10:13.907
exist in pairs

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:18.241
Till separated on earth

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:22.968
Then they go through life

00:10:24.212 --> 00:10:26.110
Searching for one another

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.369
Bu

00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:31.541
Where are you going?

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.942
Bu!

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.962
I'm waiting for you!

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.436
Hong Kong, Albert?

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:09.762
How romantic!

00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:06.787
You're telling me something?

00:12:08.132 --> 00:12:10.461
You choose for me

00:13:06.057 --> 00:13:08.148
You just decided my future

00:13:13.024 --> 00:13:14.216
Excuse me

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.083
You know a good cafe?

00:13:18.523 --> 00:13:19.955
Sure, we'll go together

00:13:20.256 --> 00:13:21.279
Thanks

00:13:30.288 --> 00:13:32.049
Typical Taiwanese!

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.248
Pardon me?

00:13:34.821 --> 00:13:36.286
You speak Cantonese?

00:13:36.487 --> 00:13:37.384
Surprised?

00:13:48.186 --> 00:13:49.811
Never flown before?

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:50.780
It shows?

00:13:51.153 --> 00:13:52.413
Yes

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:56.642
You can get lost in Hong Kong

00:13:56.985 --> 00:13:58.575
I'll show you around

00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:00.346
I know...

00:14:00.718 --> 00:14:01.876
all the trendy spots

00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:04.374
I have fans everywhere

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.016
I'm a fun guy

00:14:06.517 --> 00:14:07.380
Okay?

00:14:17.182 --> 00:14:18.011
What?

00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:19.573
Are you twins?

00:14:22.848 --> 00:14:23.779
Please forgive me

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.777
Excuse me

00:14:29.014 --> 00:14:29.980
Gangster's girlfriend

00:14:30.148 --> 00:14:31.841
disappears

00:15:01.877 --> 00:15:04.240
Morning, sir, working out?

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:06.775
No time

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.938
Bill, are you ready?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.469
Good

00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:31.631
Let's start

00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:36.594
Morning, Mr. Chan

00:15:37.072 --> 00:15:39.334
Any news from Wall Street?

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.368
Lion Fund...

00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:43.402
is borrowing heavily

00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.898
Even at...

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.764
a 20% interbank rate

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.561
Check the following

00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:55.230
How many Nikkei Futures...

00:15:55.403 --> 00:15:57.130
did they short?

00:15:57.369 --> 00:16:00.130
Is Yen...

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.927
appreciating?

00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:05.100
Is the lease for the US base...

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.393
in Japan expiring?

00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:09.261
If both answer are affirmative

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.898
Buy whatever they sell

00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:12.395
But this hedge fund

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:14.692
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

00:16:14.868 --> 00:16:17.390
Should be invincible

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.957
They're too greedy

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.925
on margin trading

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:23.062
Leveraging 10 times their worth

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:24.324
They're doomed

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.822
So go ahead

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:26.965
Yes, Mr. Chan

00:16:27.233 --> 00:16:27.891
Thank you

00:16:35.664 --> 00:16:37.289
Send this with 100 roses...

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.054
to Carman

00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:41.020
During office hours

00:16:42.097 --> 00:16:43.562
Didn't you break up?

00:16:44.497 --> 00:16:45.428
We're still friends

00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:50.521
Find someone and

00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:53.560
settle down

00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:54.757
Like who?

00:16:55.895 --> 00:16:57.384
Those women around you

00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:01.955
All so beautiful and elegant

00:17:02.528 --> 00:17:04.016
Too elegant for me

00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:06.654
What do you want?

00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:09.052
Someone amusing

00:18:11.719 --> 00:18:13.651
Make yourself at home

00:18:17.018 --> 00:18:19.609
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

00:18:22.384 --> 00:18:23.611
And you came...

00:18:24.284 --> 00:18:25.749
all that way

00:18:26.784 --> 00:18:28.773
How brave and romantic

00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:35.174
However...

00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:36.806
What?

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.447
I...

00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:41.480
What?

00:18:48.415 --> 00:18:49.971
I'm gay

00:18:54.414 --> 00:18:55.607
No

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.941
Yes

00:18:57.114 --> 00:18:57.841
Really?

00:18:58.214 --> 00:18:59.009
Really

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.139
No

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.102
Yes

00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:01.802
Honest?

00:19:01.979 --> 00:19:02.570
Honest

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:08.201
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:09.940
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:10.112 --> 00:19:10.578
What?

00:19:10.746 --> 00:19:11.643
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:12.112 --> 00:19:14.135
Such a waste

00:19:14.411 --> 00:19:15.809
Why?

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:18.302
You're a hunk

00:19:18.478 --> 00:19:20.034
I'm not

00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:31.474
That's stunning

00:19:32.976 --> 00:19:35.998
That's what inspired you

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:39.265
I moved here because of it

00:19:43.874 --> 00:19:46.170
Find a motel tonight

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.006
Fly home tomorrow

00:19:48.407 --> 00:19:51.396
I've never traveled

00:19:51.574 --> 00:19:53.267
This is a first

00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:54.769
Think I'll stay a while

00:19:55.573 --> 00:19:56.698
But Hong Kong...

00:19:57.206 --> 00:19:58.263
is boring

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.163
Fly back tomorrow

00:20:00.605 --> 00:20:02.400
My friend said

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:03.896
Hong Kong's fun

00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:07.665
Great restaurants too

00:20:08.171 --> 00:20:10.602
I'll find you...

00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:11.668
a motel

00:20:12.738 --> 00:20:14.567
I can't afford one

00:20:14.803 --> 00:20:15.565
Hands off Wait

00:20:17.037 --> 00:20:18.969
Let me stay here

00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:20.693
Women can't stay here

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:22.925
I'll go nuts

00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:25.933
Please

00:20:26.103 --> 00:20:27.932
Sorry Please

00:20:32.968 --> 00:20:36.491
I came all this way

00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:39.431
To such a big let down

00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:43.258
I don't deserve this

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:47.821
Goodbye

00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:54.497
Bu

00:20:54.666 --> 00:20:55.029
What?

00:20:55.199 --> 00:20:55.994
Your suitcase

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:19.054
Your bag

00:21:21.862 --> 00:21:24.020
I can't stand crying

00:21:24.894 --> 00:21:26.326
Makes me feel so guilty

00:21:26.761 --> 00:21:27.852
Okay, stay

00:21:28.195 --> 00:21:31.160
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.655
I'm a makeup artist

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.255
Best...

00:21:37.626 --> 00:21:39.717
in Hong Kong

00:21:50.925 --> 00:21:51.482
Exquisite

00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:56.047
That's it

00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:19.012
Hold that

00:22:22.054 --> 00:22:22.849
Good

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:42.312
I'm starving

00:22:42.485 --> 00:22:43.508
We'll wrap soon

00:22:44.084 --> 00:22:45.482
How much longer?

00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:47.541
6 hours

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.139
What?

00:22:50.384 --> 00:22:53.316
Keep that door shut

00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:55.340
We're reloading

00:22:55.683 --> 00:22:57.239
You'll fog the film

00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:37.304
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

00:23:37.678 --> 00:23:39.610
No... no emergency

00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:42.502
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:44.974
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.107
Tell me, what's going on?

00:23:55.009 --> 00:23:56.202
Maybe you'd better go

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:23.102
C.N. You're cruising and

00:24:23.273 --> 00:24:24.533
didn't invite me?

00:24:26.205 --> 00:24:27.171
Why bother, here you are

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:29.129
The press says you're romancing my girl

00:24:29.738 --> 00:24:30.795
You believe them?

00:24:31.205 --> 00:24:32.397
Grow up, LW

00:24:34.704 --> 00:24:36.363
Is it true?

00:24:37.104 --> 00:24:37.626
Yes

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.627
We've been competing since grade school

00:24:53.135 --> 00:24:54.464
You've been interested in...

00:24:54.635 --> 00:24:55.566
our stock lately

00:24:55.835 --> 00:24:57.232
I'm interested in all stocks,

00:24:57.401 --> 00:24:58.492
not just yours

00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:01.098
My associates and I

00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:04.025
Hold a majority of the shares

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.857
You can't touch my company

00:25:07.167 --> 00:25:07.825
We'll see

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.959
You're on my yacht

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:13.595
Dating my girl

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.265
And you talk to me like this

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.560
Why did you want me here?

00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:22.631
For an apology

00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.458
To make it easier on you

00:25:26.697 --> 00:25:28.424
I'm leaving now

00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:30.863
Call me...

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.893
to apologize in...

00:25:33.897 --> 00:25:34.658
5 minutes

00:25:36.863 --> 00:25:37.886
What time is it?

00:25:39.463 --> 00:25:40.587
5:30

00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:42.920
Why wear...

00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:43.823
a watch

00:25:44.062 --> 00:25:45.084
That can't tell time

00:25:45.629 --> 00:25:47.322
I like the diamonds

00:25:49.228 --> 00:25:50.091
Watch him

00:25:51.694 --> 00:25:52.989
If he doesn't call me in five

00:25:53.528 --> 00:25:54.857
Throw him overboard

00:25:56.261 --> 00:25:57.658
But give him a buoy

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.553
Yes, boss

00:25:59.226 --> 00:25:59.749
Call me

00:26:12.758 --> 00:26:13.689
Bye, boss

00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:17.886
Call him

00:26:18.324 --> 00:26:19.312
Or you'll get wet

00:26:20.491 --> 00:26:21.252
Make it snappy

00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:23.855
I've got a hot date

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.881
Don't force us to do it

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.083
Get a buoy

00:26:28.257 --> 00:26:28.984
Right

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.380
Come

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.614
Hands off

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:32.445
Easy

00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:39.843
Almost

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:47.110
Bye

00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:48.612
Here comes the buoy

00:26:48.788 --> 00:26:49.481
It's Fatty

00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:52.417
Fatty fell over

00:26:57.086 --> 00:26:58.177
Don't go

00:27:05.752 --> 00:27:06.581
Help him up

00:27:06.785 --> 00:27:07.716
Over there

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.775
Scared me

00:27:55.812 --> 00:27:56.903
You okay?

00:27:57.179 --> 00:27:57.803
I'm fine

00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:13.670
Call you

00:28:23.975 --> 00:28:24.703
Where is he?

00:28:35.507 --> 00:28:37.064
Where is he?

00:28:37.774 --> 00:28:38.467
You okay?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.037
Don't fall over again

00:28:44.106 --> 00:28:45.969
You! He's here!

00:28:48.172 --> 00:28:48.933
In the rear

00:28:49.738 --> 00:28:51.068
Help...

00:28:53.172 --> 00:28:54.432
Hold tight

00:28:55.138 --> 00:28:56.399
Close

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.225
You see him?

00:29:01.971 --> 00:29:02.527
No

00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:03.336
Look again

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.027
Over there

00:29:38.532 --> 00:29:39.828
He got away

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:40.623
Wait

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:42.589
The boss wanted him...

00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:44.595
overboard with a buoy

00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:45.956
Job's done, right?

00:29:46.232 --> 00:29:47.129
Right

00:29:47.397 --> 00:29:48.886
It's a wrap

00:30:18.094 --> 00:30:19.082
Thanks

00:30:19.927 --> 00:30:20.722
You okay?

00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:24.619
You're...

00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:26.388
Name's Bu

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.316
Bu?

00:30:30.292 --> 00:30:31.121
You a refugee?

00:30:32.658 --> 00:30:33.749
Yes

00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:35.947
From Vietnam?

00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:38.748
Right again

00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.121
How many of you?

00:30:41.691 --> 00:30:42.782
Just me, why?

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:45.213
Who's driving?

00:30:58.956 --> 00:30:59.853
Give me a hand

00:31:00.388 --> 00:31:04.615
I can't, I'm starving

00:31:05.388 --> 00:31:06.410
Aren't you?

00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:10.181
No, but I could use a snack

00:31:18.587 --> 00:31:22.848
Let's talk

00:31:23.019 --> 00:31:24.007
so I forget the hunger

00:31:24.853 --> 00:31:25.580
About what?

00:31:27.818 --> 00:31:30.284
What do you like?

00:31:32.985 --> 00:31:34.973
Nothing?

00:31:35.518 --> 00:31:37.847
Not even cars and women?

00:31:40.617 --> 00:31:43.174
Don't just smile

00:31:43.816 --> 00:31:45.873
Okay, what don't you like?

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.912
Nosy people

00:32:02.948 --> 00:32:04.277
What don't you like?

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:11.344
Growing up,

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.507
I like being naughty

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.441
Nosy?

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.977
Naughty

00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:18.173
Naughty

00:32:18.378 --> 00:32:19.173
And no one...

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:22.300
pampers you anymore

00:32:22.778 --> 00:32:23.540
What do you like?

00:32:25.878 --> 00:32:27.844
A shower when I'm sweaty

00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:29.969
Snap out of bed...

00:32:30.377 --> 00:32:32.002
to a cup of coffee

00:32:35.777 --> 00:32:37.106
I'd like one now

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:42.502
Hong Kong stars are lovely

00:32:43.409 --> 00:32:44.931
Stars are...

00:32:45.576 --> 00:32:47.666
the same everywhere

00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:50.637
If you care to look at them

00:32:55.741 --> 00:32:56.298
What?

00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:57.907
Shooting star!

00:32:59.041 --> 00:32:59.335
Really?

00:32:59.507 --> 00:33:02.234
Mom said when you see one

00:33:02.407 --> 00:33:04.838
Touch your pocket and make a wish

00:33:05.006 --> 00:33:05.903
And it'll come true

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:07.896
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

00:33:09.673 --> 00:33:11.002
Another one

00:33:22.304 --> 00:33:23.429
What's your wish?

00:33:24.404 --> 00:33:26.427
Can't tell you

00:33:32.303 --> 00:33:34.098
Or it won't come true

00:33:37.836 --> 00:33:38.767
I'm so sleepy

00:34:32.662 --> 00:34:33.889
A boat! Help!

00:34:40.195 --> 00:34:42.683
Over here!

00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:22.250
The Silicon Valley stocks?

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:27.320
They'll go even higher

00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.314
Check one thing

00:35:34.188 --> 00:35:35.847
Does LW control...

00:35:36.253 --> 00:35:37.049
his company's shares?

00:35:56.418 --> 00:35:57.509
Buy me a new mobile

00:35:59.151 --> 00:36:00.117
It drowned

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:12.481
There's no transport...

00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:14.138
around here

00:36:14.316 --> 00:36:15.645
I'll give you a ride

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:19.242
Just tell me where I am

00:36:19.415 --> 00:36:20.506
and I'll walk back

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:22.510
We're out

00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:25.306
in the boonies, Miss

00:36:25.748 --> 00:36:26.805
Name's Bu

00:36:27.114 --> 00:36:29.137
Boo? Bu!

00:36:29.314 --> 00:36:30.870
Just get in

00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.637
Sure

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.743
Not you, this lady here

00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:40.706
There are only 2 seats

00:36:41.279 --> 00:36:42.040
I know

00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:43.909
Here's 20 bucks

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.670
Around the corner...

00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:48.606
are buses and cabs

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.964
Compulsive liar

00:37:18.374 --> 00:37:19.170
Come in

00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:23.606
Huge place, you live alone?

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.863
There's a butler

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.430
Must get crowded

00:37:29.406 --> 00:37:30.429
Wait here

00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:31.536
Can I look around?

00:37:31.706 --> 00:37:32.502
Help yourself

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:33.262
Thanks

00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:49.066
I'm starving

00:37:55.437 --> 00:37:57.369
Some food please!

00:38:38.264 --> 00:38:38.958
Need something?

00:38:39.831 --> 00:38:41.023
Fish food

00:38:41.464 --> 00:38:43.487
They're electronic fish

00:38:45.396 --> 00:38:47.056
Come over here

00:38:47.363 --> 00:38:48.761
Why electronic fish?

00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:50.884
I never change the water

00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:52.824
Fish never die, it's perfect

00:38:53.096 --> 00:38:54.027
And if the power's out?

00:38:56.995 --> 00:38:59.859
You invite friends over?

00:39:00.395 --> 00:39:01.122
Don't have any

00:39:01.594 --> 00:39:02.457
So boring, and lonely

00:39:15.759 --> 00:39:16.486
Now what?

00:39:18.392 --> 00:39:19.517
You like to fight?

00:39:20.292 --> 00:39:21.519
Some golf,

00:39:22.325 --> 00:39:23.585
some race horses

00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:26.019
I box and work out

00:39:27.591 --> 00:39:28.818
What's the octopus for?

00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:30.290
You're so nosy

00:39:30.924 --> 00:39:31.617
Sorry

00:39:39.956 --> 00:39:42.183
This should fit, change in there

00:39:55.288 --> 00:39:57.719
Betty, call me a cab

00:39:58.988 --> 00:40:00.214
20 minutes? Great

00:40:28.483 --> 00:40:29.642
There's a room...

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.210
behind the mirror

00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:37.476
How would I have known?

00:40:39.982 --> 00:40:40.505
Hungry?

00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:42.705
Starving

00:40:43.082 --> 00:40:44.241
Me too

00:40:44.948 --> 00:40:47.243
Any Chinese pot rice?

00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:49.071
What?

00:41:02.179 --> 00:41:04.111
Best take out food ever

00:41:04.646 --> 00:41:06.111
My favorite

00:41:07.645 --> 00:41:09.270
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

00:41:09.979 --> 00:41:11.035
I hate the smell

00:41:15.045 --> 00:41:17.272
Don't stare. Eat up

00:41:17.778 --> 00:41:18.573
Sure

00:41:35.808 --> 00:41:36.604
Now what?

00:41:36.975 --> 00:41:38.441
You're amusing when you eat

00:41:44.441 --> 00:41:45.270
Are you rich?

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:47.635
I guess so

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.334
What do you do?

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:50.834
I'm into trash

00:41:51.507 --> 00:41:52.473
C'mon

00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:53.962
No, I sell trash

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.930
Be that way

00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:09.101
Can I have a soda?

00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:10.595
Juice is better for you

00:42:34.934 --> 00:42:37.900
Bu took the lift down

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.364
What's wrong?

00:43:10.996 --> 00:43:13.518
Stop moaning

00:43:16.096 --> 00:43:17.823
You know

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.853
That bottle's very special

00:43:22.062 --> 00:43:22.959
So special that...

00:43:23.528 --> 00:43:25.187
all of a sudden

00:43:25.361 --> 00:43:27.224
I'm feeding and sheltering you

00:43:27.395 --> 00:43:28.156
Just like that

00:43:28.495 --> 00:43:31.392
Remember I told you about...

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.526
C. N? More than once

00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:35.852
Last night...

00:43:36.027 --> 00:43:38.322
You told me that too

00:43:38.826 --> 00:43:42.724
I think he's... nice

00:43:42.925 --> 00:43:43.652
Nice?

00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:49.518
These magazines are published weekly

00:43:49.692 --> 00:43:52.385
And he changes girlfriends just as often

00:43:52.991 --> 00:43:56.423
He's not nice, he's a playboy

00:43:56.591 --> 00:43:57.386
Let's see

00:43:58.157 --> 00:43:59.521
An ex-girlfriend says

00:44:03.923 --> 00:44:07.286
He doesn't say sweet words

00:44:07.756 --> 00:44:10.847
But he's a romantic man

00:44:11.555 --> 00:44:14.612
He appears stem and talks tough

00:44:15.222 --> 00:44:17.279
Inside he's like a kid

00:44:18.254 --> 00:44:21.243
He's competitive and chases novelty

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.218
Never regrets any decision

00:44:25.187 --> 00:44:26.118
With him...

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.647
You feel insecure

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.751
Meaning?

00:44:31.286 --> 00:44:33.376
Chases novelty, so he fools around

00:44:33.986 --> 00:44:35.508
No regrets,

00:44:35.853 --> 00:44:37.182
so he enjoys dumping women

00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:39.317
Maybe those women deserved it

00:44:39.585 --> 00:44:40.949
They were insecure...

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:43.641
to begin with

00:44:43.918 --> 00:44:45.042
Spare me

00:44:48.651 --> 00:44:50.674
Hong Kong's boring anyway

00:44:52.484 --> 00:44:53.108
Going home?

00:44:53.584 --> 00:44:56.447
No, C.N. Is fun

00:44:58.316 --> 00:45:00.305
You have to hook him first

00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:01.643
Can't just walk up

00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:03.610
And take off your clothes

00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:05.710
That sure won't work

00:45:05.882 --> 00:45:07.438
But you never know

00:45:07.882 --> 00:45:08.938
He's competitive and

00:45:09.115 --> 00:45:11.240
chases novelty

00:45:11.547 --> 00:45:13.513
I have a plan, I need your help

00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:14.374
No way

00:45:15.247 --> 00:45:16.713
Please

00:45:18.147 --> 00:45:18.976
Sorry

00:45:21.713 --> 00:45:22.804
Please tell me

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.809
where your daughter is

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.770
She found a bottle

00:45:26.946 --> 00:45:28.310
She's in Hong Kong

00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:32.641
I have to get Bu back

00:45:33.512 --> 00:45:34.307
Chow Yun Fat!

00:45:35.112 --> 00:45:38.441
Mr. Chow

00:45:40.244 --> 00:45:41.800
Wrong guy

00:45:41.977 --> 00:45:42.943
You speak Mandarin?

00:45:43.311 --> 00:45:45.140
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.970
Don't try to fool me

00:45:47.143 --> 00:45:48.870
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

00:45:49.943 --> 00:45:52.171
Mr. Chow, you're back!

00:45:52.442 --> 00:45:53.567
Fresh form Hollywood?

00:45:53.743 --> 00:45:54.936
Please sign Can I take a picture?

00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:57.632
You mind? OK

00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:01.472
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:04.903
My turn, miss

00:46:05.274 --> 00:46:07.535
Point a gun at me

00:46:07.707 --> 00:46:10.138
Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

00:46:10.974 --> 00:46:13.599
Thank you, Mr. Chow

00:46:14.173 --> 00:46:16.730
Give me a hug

00:46:19.606 --> 00:46:22.003
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

00:46:22.306 --> 00:46:23.601
I'll send you the photos

00:46:23.772 --> 00:46:25.068
Bye You're so sweet

00:46:25.238 --> 00:46:26.100
Same as the photo

00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:27.159
Print me a copy

00:46:29.005 --> 00:46:30.630
He's such a hunk Bye

00:46:30.804 --> 00:46:31.667
Bye

00:46:33.838 --> 00:46:34.633
My bag!

00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:42.667
We checked LW's company

00:46:43.003 --> 00:46:44.162
Last year,

00:46:44.336 --> 00:46:45.665
rumover grew 13%

00:46:45.902 --> 00:46:48.595
Profit: Over HK$1 billion

00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:51.594
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

00:46:52.035 --> 00:46:53.160
We have acquired...

00:46:53.335 --> 00:46:55.527
16% of the company

00:46:55.935 --> 00:46:59.059
LW and his associates...

00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:01.496
still hold 65%

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.857
But...

00:47:04.134 --> 00:47:05.599
they're not selling

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.357
Dump all my stocks

00:47:09.933 --> 00:47:12.296
If we dump them,

00:47:12.466 --> 00:47:13.591
the price will plunge

00:47:13.766 --> 00:47:17.925
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:20.397
Just do it

00:47:23.665 --> 00:47:24.631
I need to see K.K.

00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:25.624
Yes, sir

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:27.326
Who's K. K?

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.291
Head of Environmental Protection

00:48:29.689 --> 00:48:31.655
Going up or down?

00:48:32.123 --> 00:48:34.418
I was seeing friends upstairs

00:48:34.955 --> 00:48:35.784
There's no upstairs

00:48:37.022 --> 00:48:37.817
Really?

00:48:39.222 --> 00:48:42.187
Actually they live downstairs

00:48:42.455 --> 00:48:43.079
Names?

00:48:44.587 --> 00:48:45.985
I forgot

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.477
So quiet here

00:48:51.853 --> 00:48:54.285
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

00:48:54.486 --> 00:48:55.975
You messed up my wall

00:48:57.986 --> 00:48:59.009
Excuse me?

00:49:06.585 --> 00:49:08.312
Look!

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.041
Easy there

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:18.743
Let go

00:49:18.917 --> 00:49:19.712
Who sent you?

00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:21.378
Let go first

00:49:23.882 --> 00:49:24.643
Like my writing?

00:49:36.414 --> 00:49:39.039
Enough. I don't know kungfu

00:49:39.381 --> 00:49:40.539
I'm just a messenger

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.404
Message?

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.107
My back pocket

00:49:52.779 --> 00:49:57.370
Bully. You messed up my arm

00:49:57.545 --> 00:49:58.533
Happy reading

00:50:01.011 --> 00:50:01.443
Gangster's girlfriend...

00:50:01.612 --> 00:50:02.202
disappears

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:09.203
What happened?

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.201
Fell down some stairs

00:50:11.377 --> 00:50:12.035
You okay?

00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:12.640
I'll live

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.267
Will he buy...

00:50:15.443 --> 00:50:16.773
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

00:50:17.009 --> 00:50:18.134
How should I know?

00:50:18.709 --> 00:50:19.834
Will it work?

00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:21.365
Of course

00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:24.698
What's next?

00:50:24.875 --> 00:50:26.965
Showtime

00:50:27.141 --> 00:50:28.504
Where are your pals?

00:50:36.374 --> 00:50:37.930
You know we're bad

00:50:38.107 --> 00:50:39.629
We're here to waste you

00:50:40.273 --> 00:50:41.170
React!

00:50:41.772 --> 00:50:42.999
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:46.627
Is a Taiwanese gangster

00:50:46.806 --> 00:50:48.271
The sworn enemy of our boss

00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:50.462
He wants you defaced

00:50:50.639 --> 00:50:52.536
Frog, your turn

00:50:52.771 --> 00:50:54.327
Believe it or not

00:50:54.671 --> 00:50:56.500
You're front page news

00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:59.630
Everyone's looking for you now

00:51:02.904 --> 00:51:04.164
Yes. Looking awesome

00:51:30.434 --> 00:51:31.024
You okay?

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.629
Yes, and you?

00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:35.394
It's you!

00:51:35.633 --> 00:51:36.098
You okay?

00:51:36.299 --> 00:51:36.923
Yes

00:51:42.465 --> 00:51:43.396
I don't know these goons

00:51:43.565 --> 00:51:44.155
What?

00:51:44.498 --> 00:51:44.929
Nothing

00:52:16.428 --> 00:52:17.688
You can't be ID'ed

00:52:19.328 --> 00:52:20.816
They're damn good actors

00:53:31.718 --> 00:53:32.877
Back off

00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:35.082
Stay here

00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:37.308
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

00:53:37.617 --> 00:53:38.708
You're bleeding

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.511
We'll spare you today

00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:44.647
Don't provoke him

00:53:45.716 --> 00:53:47.909
Cops will go after them

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:48.739
Not us

00:53:50.949 --> 00:53:51.915
Hi, there

00:53:52.282 --> 00:53:58.544
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

00:53:59.114 --> 00:53:59.875
Thanks

00:54:00.381 --> 00:54:02.108
Someone reported a fight

00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:03.008
We were attacked

00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:04.371
They leave any evidence?

00:54:04.714 --> 00:54:05.771
Baseball bats

00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:09.442
Sunny, smell

00:54:10.613 --> 00:54:12.170
Any clues?

00:54:23.145 --> 00:54:25.441
Sunny, you're clueless

00:54:26.078 --> 00:54:27.509
Let's get help

00:54:32.544 --> 00:54:34.032
My site, very safe

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.169
It's so trashy

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:38.839
I told you I sell trash

00:54:39.176 --> 00:54:40.801
Expensive stuff too

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:44.103
Expensive? Trash is trash

00:54:44.842 --> 00:54:46.068
Before you were...

00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:47.432
a Vietnamese refugee

00:54:47.808 --> 00:54:49.035
Now you're...

00:54:49.342 --> 00:54:51.364
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

00:54:51.908 --> 00:54:53.305
So who are you, really?

00:54:53.808 --> 00:54:56.602
A dangerous woman

00:54:56.874 --> 00:54:57.737
Scared?

00:54:58.507 --> 00:54:59.370
Never

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.499
Thrilled to be with me?

00:55:06.906 --> 00:55:09.201
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

00:55:11.005 --> 00:55:13.698
I lived near a police station

00:55:13.972 --> 00:55:16.733
with posters of wanted criminals

00:55:17.338 --> 00:55:21.565
One of them was a hunk

00:55:22.004 --> 00:55:24.492
I saw his poster everyday

00:55:25.137 --> 00:55:27.898
And I fell in love

00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:28.930
And?

00:55:29.803 --> 00:55:33.098
I found him, stole his heart

00:55:34.036 --> 00:55:35.525
How was he?

00:55:36.602 --> 00:55:40.159
Cute, a great dancer

00:55:42.368 --> 00:55:43.856
Really romantic

00:55:45.568 --> 00:55:46.795
For being a dancer?

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.757
You dance?

00:55:50.334 --> 00:55:50.958
Of course

00:55:54.134 --> 00:55:55.031
This?

00:55:57.099 --> 00:55:57.758
Sure

00:55:59.666 --> 00:56:00.825
Tango?

00:56:05.532 --> 00:56:06.293
That too

00:56:07.232 --> 00:56:10.322
So common, nothing more exciting?

00:56:10.731 --> 00:56:12.060
Sure Really?

00:56:12.531 --> 00:56:13.928
Teach me

00:56:15.797 --> 00:56:16.626
You'll be scared

00:56:16.864 --> 00:56:17.761
No way

00:56:20.297 --> 00:56:21.285
Hold me

00:56:21.764 --> 00:56:22.922
Give me your legs

00:56:23.196 --> 00:56:24.127
Right

00:56:25.163 --> 00:56:25.787
Ready?

00:56:28.995 --> 00:56:29.858
Help!

00:56:36.061 --> 00:56:36.652
Exciting enough?

00:56:36.828 --> 00:56:37.316
Yes

00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:38.417
No more?

00:56:38.894 --> 00:56:39.485
You aren't scared?

00:56:39.694 --> 00:56:40.353
Never

00:56:40.994 --> 00:56:41.960
More moves?

00:56:45.927 --> 00:56:47.790
Just hold tight and

00:56:47.993 --> 00:56:48.720
stay still

00:56:49.093 --> 00:56:50.184
Enjoy the variations

00:56:50.459 --> 00:56:50.823
Really? Okay?

00:56:50.993 --> 00:56:51.549
Okay...

00:56:51.726 --> 00:56:52.384
There

00:56:53.092 --> 00:56:54.648
Run, 1, 2, 3

00:57:03.658 --> 00:57:06.351
Wow! This is fun

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.183
Man's so busy

00:57:10.591 --> 00:57:11.783
Making trash

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:15.583
The recycling business is a gold mine

00:57:16.189 --> 00:57:16.655
They say...

00:57:16.823 --> 00:57:18.617
What others abandon, I take

00:57:20.123 --> 00:57:21.349
You did well last time

00:57:22.155 --> 00:57:24.678
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:27.554
They all know you're my protégé

00:57:27.821 --> 00:57:28.650
I'm flattered

00:57:28.922 --> 00:57:29.546
Thank you

00:57:30.254 --> 00:57:33.618
Don't thank me, thank yourself

00:57:34.254 --> 00:57:36.651
Any new plans?

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.511
I heard you're buying LW's company

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.542
You know

00:57:44.886 --> 00:57:46.681
what's the best win?

00:57:48.852 --> 00:57:51.511
Winning one's battle...

00:57:52.152 --> 00:57:54.709
with the enemy's respect

00:58:01.784 --> 00:58:02.807
Stock Exchange's closed

00:58:02.984 --> 00:58:03.711
And?

00:58:04.617 --> 00:58:07.673
Our stock dropped 20%

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:08.975
Closed at $6.50

00:58:12.283 --> 00:58:13.510
Our drop in asset value?

00:58:14.682 --> 00:58:16.511
Over 2 billion

00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:18.947
It's Chan,

00:58:19.115 --> 00:58:20.240
he's dumping our shares

00:58:22.448 --> 00:58:24.310
What's the news on him?

00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:27.442
Rumors are he wants...

00:58:27.648 --> 00:58:28.943
to buy our company

00:58:29.947 --> 00:58:31.572
Then...

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.807
why dump his shares?

00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:38.636
After buying them so high?

00:58:40.279 --> 00:58:43.541
What's he up to?

00:58:44.245 --> 00:58:45.040
Boss

00:58:50.378 --> 00:58:51.275
What happened to you?

00:58:51.645 --> 00:58:53.167
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

00:58:53.478 --> 00:58:54.307
Was he hurt?

00:58:54.944 --> 00:58:56.341
Not a scratch

00:58:56.610 --> 00:58:57.940
Thank God

00:58:58.377 --> 00:58:59.138
Else...

00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:00.503
I'd blame myself

00:59:00.943 --> 00:59:01.966
And if...

00:59:02.143 --> 00:59:04.506
Well,

00:59:04.676 --> 00:59:05.937
you actually were hurt

00:59:07.409 --> 00:59:08.965
And see, I feel guilty

00:59:09.142 --> 00:59:10.698
It was your dad's idea

00:59:12.375 --> 00:59:13.932
He screwed up

00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:16.066
Ordering an ambush

00:59:16.441 --> 00:59:17.963
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

00:59:18.507 --> 00:59:20.735
That's much faster

00:59:21.108 --> 00:59:23.232
Let's do it

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.435
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

00:59:28.773 --> 00:59:30.796
Challenge him openly

00:59:31.906 --> 00:59:33.167
Right

00:59:34.839 --> 00:59:37.862
Yes!

00:59:38.938 --> 00:59:41.234
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:43.596
Tougher

00:59:45.005 --> 00:59:46.766
Smaller

00:59:47.937 --> 00:59:48.766
And...

00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:50.634
Handsomer than Chan

00:59:51.037 --> 00:59:53.093
He'll be devastated

01:00:01.602 --> 01:00:02.192
What's that?

01:00:03.269 --> 01:00:07.667
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:09.129
Tricky signals

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:20.495
Have you seen her?

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:23.731
That's Mary

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.990
No, that's Bunny

01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:27.357
No, that's Mary

01:00:27.533 --> 01:00:29.930
That's Bunny, come with me

01:00:30.132 --> 01:00:33.063
No, that way

01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:35.021
No

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.322
Another Bunny?

01:00:38.098 --> 01:00:39.859
A masseuse

01:00:40.197 --> 01:00:41.720
A masseuse?

01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:42.963
Why not?

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:06.025
Oh my God, what's he doing?

01:01:25.491 --> 01:01:26.787
Albert!

01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:31.384
Do I look pretty?

01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:32.886
Yes

01:01:35.257 --> 01:01:36.019
What?

01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:38.322
Your outfit

01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:40.579
My Sunday best

01:01:42.257 --> 01:01:43.779
Go to...

01:01:43.956 --> 01:01:45.148
Jean-Paul's Boutique

01:01:45.322 --> 01:01:46.618
I'll call him,

01:01:46.855 --> 01:01:48.014
let him dress you

01:01:49.455 --> 01:01:50.921
You feed, shelter,

01:01:51.089 --> 01:01:52.918
and clothe me

01:01:53.088 --> 01:01:53.985
You're my guardian angel

01:01:55.054 --> 01:01:56.111
Your wish is...

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.477
my command

01:01:58.754 --> 01:01:59.344
Bye

01:02:01.487 --> 01:02:01.884
What?

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.352
How should I behave at dinner?

01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:07.543
You're playing a gangster's lady

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.083
Use method acting

01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:14.242
Teach me

01:02:14.552 --> 01:02:15.449
Just act snooty

01:02:16.418 --> 01:02:18.008
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

01:02:19.751 --> 01:02:21.774
I'm an angel

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.443
She forgot something?

01:02:28.516 --> 01:02:29.504
Yes?

01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.044
Help!

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:32.977
It's you!

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:40.047
Where's Bu?

01:02:45.514 --> 01:02:49.139
Please tell me where she is

01:03:01.246 --> 01:03:01.836
Mr. Chan

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:02.534
Thanks

01:03:07.446 --> 01:03:07.877
Mr. Chan

01:03:27.142 --> 01:03:27.767
What's this?

01:03:28.576 --> 01:03:29.473
Excuse me

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.670
The lady's so lovely

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.397
She deserves some wind effect

01:03:36.675 --> 01:03:37.436
You look gorgeous

01:03:37.741 --> 01:03:38.435
I know

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:50.134
Well?

01:03:51.373 --> 01:03:53.430
A vintage wine, from '82

01:03:59.005 --> 01:04:02.494
But I can also tell

01:04:04.072 --> 01:04:06.469
The grape-picker was born in '60

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:10.065
Let's order

01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:15.334
You order

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:19.336
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

01:04:22.135 --> 01:04:23.431
Just kidding

01:04:23.935 --> 01:04:24.764
Thank God!

01:04:29.568 --> 01:04:32.193
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

01:04:34.867 --> 01:04:36.696
We don't want to be crowded

01:04:42.866 --> 01:04:43.763
Excuse me

01:04:45.933 --> 01:04:47.592
You booked the whole place?

01:04:48.932 --> 01:04:50.522
Just you and me

01:04:51.732 --> 01:04:53.254
I was hoping

01:04:53.498 --> 01:04:55.794
To run into celebrities

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.219
You must really...

01:04:58.398 --> 01:04:59.954
hate crowds

01:05:00.131 --> 01:05:01.391
What about your friends?

01:05:06.463 --> 01:05:07.827
Here comes one

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:10.752
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:17.790
Why'd you do it?

01:05:18.262 --> 01:05:20.989
Dump my company's shares?

01:05:21.195 --> 01:05:21.956
I'm at dinner,

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:23.116
call me tomorrow

01:05:25.695 --> 01:05:28.354
You're hurting me

01:05:28.628 --> 01:05:30.389
And yourself too

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:33.559
Mr. Lo, please leave

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.889
Sir

01:05:35.493 --> 01:05:36.822
You look intelligent

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.584
I am intelligent

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:41.024
Then stay home and think

01:05:41.192 --> 01:05:42.715
Devise a way...

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:44.721
to save your company

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:47.914
Who are you?

01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:49.448
C.N.'s friend

01:05:49.758 --> 01:05:51.724
He booked the whole place for me

01:05:52.358 --> 01:05:54.324
You're disturbing us

01:05:54.757 --> 01:05:56.950
That's so rude

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.517
Let's talk outside

01:06:03.823 --> 01:06:04.686
We've talked enough

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.485
See you outside

01:06:11.455 --> 01:06:14.852
That signal means "Follow me"

01:06:15.422 --> 01:06:16.410
Wrong again?

01:06:21.721 --> 01:06:22.845
You're snooty

01:06:23.654 --> 01:06:25.482
So are my friends

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.016
it rubs off

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:31.574
You have to go?

01:06:33.886 --> 01:06:36.875
It'll just take a minute

01:06:46.551 --> 01:06:47.346
C.N.

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:50.775
Watch your back

01:07:01.082 --> 01:07:02.309
Watch your back

01:07:03.915 --> 01:07:04.539
I called,

01:07:04.915 --> 01:07:07.608
cleared it with your boss

01:07:08.015 --> 01:07:09.480
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:12.409
Close the parking lot for us

01:07:13.148 --> 01:07:15.739
Relax, I'm footing the bill

01:07:15.981 --> 01:07:16.571
Fine, Mr. Lo

01:07:17.013 --> 01:07:18.445
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

01:07:21.147 --> 01:07:22.806
Have fun, Mr. Chan

01:07:24.713 --> 01:07:25.303
LW

01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:27.042
What's up?

01:07:27.513 --> 01:07:29.206
I want you to meet someone

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.237
I hired him from overseas

01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:33.342
Ladies and gentlemen

01:07:35.178 --> 01:07:36.041
Alan

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:45.065
An undefeated light-weight champion

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:49.874
He'll fight you one-on-one

01:07:51.676 --> 01:07:52.937
But...

01:07:53.143 --> 01:07:54.506
I'm a middle-weight

01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:56.199
Too much of an edge

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:59.669
But if you lose

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:03.269
Think of the disgrace

01:08:05.007 --> 01:08:07.564
Grow up

01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:08.830
Nuts

01:08:09.907 --> 01:08:10.736
Play this music for me

01:08:10.907 --> 01:08:11.804
No problem

01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:05.364
You have no choice

01:09:07.932 --> 01:09:08.989
Why the gloves?

01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:11.356
This is a boxing match

01:09:11.599 --> 01:09:12.565
I'm not...

01:09:12.766 --> 01:09:13.424
into crippling people

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:15.623
With gloves, it won't hurt?

01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:18.094
Sure it'll hurt

01:09:18.265 --> 01:09:19.958
But much less

01:09:24.398 --> 01:09:25.489
All set

01:09:26.264 --> 01:09:26.922
Watch your head

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:29.989
Music

01:09:30.764 --> 01:09:32.229
Knock me down anyway you can

01:09:33.397 --> 01:09:34.953
But no dirty tricks

01:09:38.162 --> 01:09:40.821
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

01:09:43.828 --> 01:09:47.590
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

01:09:53.128 --> 01:09:54.094
You ask for it

01:09:55.861 --> 01:09:56.349
Are you ready?

01:09:56.527 --> 01:09:57.151
Of course

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:01.720
Alan's losing big time

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.457
No, Alan's just testing him

01:10:04.759 --> 01:10:06.248
He's wearing Chan down

01:10:21.224 --> 01:10:24.519
Wait Good

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:34.347
Changing gloves, why?

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:35.887
Even the odds

01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:37.719
Bigger the glove,

01:10:37.955 --> 01:10:39.182
bigger the handicap

01:10:39.588 --> 01:10:42.179
Chan's punches are soft

01:10:48.021 --> 01:10:49.247
I've come a long way,

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.042
I don't want a short game

01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:55.518
Every boxer trains...

01:10:55.853 --> 01:10:56.876
to his own music

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:57.916
When he fights,

01:10:58.119 --> 01:10:59.779
it give him rhythm

01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:01.811
And rhythm paces his steps

01:11:05.551 --> 01:11:07.710
Chan has no rhythm

01:11:08.251 --> 01:11:10.183
He's controlled by Alan

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:12.314
You're an expert

01:11:12.484 --> 01:11:13.041
You should be fighting

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:14.074
Right

01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:16.311
C.N. And I used to box

01:11:16.517 --> 01:11:17.812
But I always lost

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.509
So I quit and became a...

01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:20.741
Commentator

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:21.574
Wow!

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:23.281
You like that better?

01:11:23.815 --> 01:11:26.474
Sure. I sound so invincible

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:28.113
But I'm just like you guys

01:11:28.615 --> 01:11:30.205
Helpless

01:11:37.948 --> 01:11:40.140
Chan used to have brilliant moves

01:11:40.381 --> 01:11:41.210
Now he's a mess

01:11:42.513 --> 01:11:45.308
Buying companies...

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.241
instead of training

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:48.402
Loser!

01:12:17.342 --> 01:12:20.570
Chan's nervous, it's over

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:28.592
Good hit, but not enough power

01:13:47.031 --> 01:13:47.928
Come on

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:29.313
You okay?

01:14:30.959 --> 01:14:31.925
You win

01:14:34.758 --> 01:14:36.849
We won

01:14:37.192 --> 01:14:39.555
Let's kick him while he's down

01:14:39.858 --> 01:14:40.982
Good idea

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:46.050
Don't be...

01:14:46.657 --> 01:14:48.486
such cowards

01:14:49.256 --> 01:14:50.619
Ganging up on a downed man

01:14:50.789 --> 01:14:52.721
There's no honor in that

01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.916
You're good

01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:02.512
Get the car

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.216
My joy is done. He's good

01:15:17.053 --> 01:15:19.814
C.N., you okay?

01:15:22.286 --> 01:15:23.945
You must be delighted

01:15:25.452 --> 01:15:28.384
No, but I thought I would be

01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:34.083
You need help?

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:38.912
Damn it

01:15:44.183 --> 01:15:46.671
C.N., call me

01:16:21.545 --> 01:16:22.272
You didn't leave?

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.243
You asked me to wait

01:16:25.044 --> 01:16:27.407
I came to find you

01:16:29.777 --> 01:16:32.265
Did they gang up on you?

01:16:32.577 --> 01:16:35.633
No, one-on-one, I lost

01:16:37.043 --> 01:16:40.304
You'll get used to it

01:16:42.109 --> 01:16:43.166
Just kidding

01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:47.339
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

01:16:48.741 --> 01:16:52.105
I'll train, but not for them

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.567
For what then?

01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:59.463
A strong body, a quick mind

01:17:00.873 --> 01:17:02.600
I haven't trained in ages

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:07.103
Your huge gym, what a waste

01:17:08.973 --> 01:17:10.268
I hate training alone

01:17:12.972 --> 01:17:14.961
I'll join you

01:17:17.705 --> 01:17:18.693
Why be so nice to me?

01:17:19.937 --> 01:17:21.062
You're rich

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:25.126
You're cute when you smile

01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:28.635
You looked grouchy just now

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.727
That's why you lost

01:17:32.536 --> 01:17:33.900
Stick with smiling

01:17:35.369 --> 01:17:37.926
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

01:17:42.234 --> 01:17:43.700
Take tomorrow off

01:17:43.968 --> 01:17:44.626
Why?

01:17:45.034 --> 01:17:46.261
Say yes first

01:17:46.467 --> 01:17:46.865
Why?

01:17:47.234 --> 01:17:48.358
Say yes first

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.491
Yes, now why?

01:17:51.866 --> 01:17:52.627
Play!

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.198
Memories are so many

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.424
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

01:18:02.999 --> 01:18:07.363
I sketch a hazy future

01:18:08.298 --> 01:18:12.696
Knowing this illusion is love

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:17.360
The tides of a lifetime

01:18:17.897 --> 01:18:22.591
Widen the shores slowly

01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:27.518
Quietly you and I meet

01:18:28.029 --> 01:18:33.120
Our love proves life is ever changing

01:18:34.262 --> 01:18:39.421
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:18:39.595 --> 01:18:44.390
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.390
Like eternity

01:18:48.393 --> 01:18:52.983
Is the night really still young?

01:18:54.426 --> 01:18:59.585
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

01:18:59.758 --> 01:19:04.587
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

01:19:04.757 --> 01:19:08.553
I can think no more

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.919
But this love

01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:15.919
Links the sea with the sky

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:43.948
My eyes have been raining

01:19:44.686 --> 01:19:49.015
I can't hold on with both hands

01:19:49.586 --> 01:19:53.813
I cry as we seek happiness

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:59.411
You're just like a shooting star

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:04.148
Those happy moments

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:09.443
Lock you between my brows

01:20:09.816 --> 01:20:14.145
No matter how the world dazzles

01:20:14.748 --> 01:20:19.908
It pales next to your eternal splendor

01:20:20.748 --> 01:20:26.270
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:31.038
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:20:31.213 --> 01:20:34.269
Like eternity

01:20:35.379 --> 01:20:39.970
Is the night really still young?

01:20:40.612 --> 01:20:41.407
You love me?

01:20:44.045 --> 01:20:44.976
I think you're quite...

01:20:45.145 --> 01:20:47.508
Answer the question

01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:49.472
The fact is...

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.576
C'mon

01:20:52.277 --> 01:20:55.368
Answer in 4 words or less

01:20:55.877 --> 01:20:58.968
I love you

01:21:00.109 --> 01:21:02.734
Or I don't

01:21:24.138 --> 01:21:26.366
When did you slip in?

01:21:26.604 --> 01:21:30.730
I'm in love

01:21:30.904 --> 01:21:36.302
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

01:21:36.836 --> 01:21:41.893
So don't get fooled by love

01:21:43.735 --> 01:21:46.826
You're such an optimist

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:50.863
I have news for you

01:21:51.467 --> 01:21:52.195
What?

01:21:52.434 --> 01:21:53.661
Longyi's here

01:21:56.667 --> 01:21:57.996
He almost strangled me

01:21:58.367 --> 01:22:00.491
But I calmed him down

01:22:00.967 --> 01:22:02.523
He's been drunk ever since

01:22:03.866 --> 01:22:05.526
My fault

01:22:05.799 --> 01:22:09.561
No way

01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:12.730
Listen, love is not sympathy

01:22:13.098 --> 01:22:15.155
You're tangled up...

01:22:15.332 --> 01:22:16.319
with Chan

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:17.486
Don't let Longyi see you

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:24.928
Wine please No

01:22:25.097 --> 01:22:26.323
Wait

01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:27.493
Let go

01:22:27.963 --> 01:22:28.622
No

01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:29.820
Kitchen time

01:22:29.996 --> 01:22:30.552
Kitchen

01:22:32.829 --> 01:22:33.852
I need...

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:39.325
What?

01:22:39.895 --> 01:22:40.758
I...

01:22:41.129 --> 01:22:43.219
I need a glass

01:22:43.394 --> 01:22:44.791
I'll get it

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.253
Go inside

01:22:48.927 --> 01:22:50.051
No pushing

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.222
Albert

01:22:57.893 --> 01:22:59.222
Where's the opener?

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:03.454
Albert

01:23:05.258 --> 01:23:06.189
Smooth move

01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:08.984
So cold!

01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:10.055
Albert

01:23:12.324 --> 01:23:13.381
Now what?

01:23:14.257 --> 01:23:17.620
I need the opener

01:23:21.057 --> 01:23:22.613
Where is it?

01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:24.217
Hurry!

01:23:29.856 --> 01:23:30.753
What's that?

01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:35.087
The family above us

01:23:35.255 --> 01:23:36.743
Has a brat

01:23:37.954 --> 01:23:39.420
It's from above us?

01:23:40.588 --> 01:23:42.951
Where else?

01:23:57.219 --> 01:23:58.650
It's from above us

01:23:59.418 --> 01:24:02.009
It's that brat again

01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:04.311
Opener

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:05.712
Forget it

01:24:07.984 --> 01:24:09.915
Drink it this way

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:12.543
Wait Come

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:14.548
Drink with me

01:24:17.716 --> 01:24:18.374
You okay?

01:24:18.716 --> 01:24:22.079
I must tell C.N.

01:24:22.249 --> 01:24:23.475
A game...

01:24:23.648 --> 01:24:24.807
is fun

01:24:24.982 --> 01:24:27.243
Till its secret is revealed

01:24:27.648 --> 01:24:31.340
I know he loves me

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.812
He skips work to be with me

01:24:36.147 --> 01:24:39.170
I miss him day and night

01:24:39.813 --> 01:24:42.108
I'm like a child again

01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:45.278
Getting so attached to him

01:24:46.012 --> 01:24:47.773
I see something beautiful

01:24:48.145 --> 01:24:49.805
I want it for him

01:24:50.245 --> 01:24:53.642
Something happens, I want to tell him

01:24:54.078 --> 01:24:57.339
I'm so happy

01:24:57.877 --> 01:24:58.639
And...

01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:59.637
so cold!

01:25:00.377 --> 01:25:01.933
You're in love

01:25:05.176 --> 01:25:05.835
Need something?

01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:07.703
Sake

01:25:08.043 --> 01:25:09.168
Finish your wine first

01:25:09.343 --> 01:25:10.933
I want sake

01:25:11.275 --> 01:25:13.468
Just wait outside Sake

01:25:14.842 --> 01:25:16.035
Hang on

01:25:19.675 --> 01:25:20.970
Excuse me

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.171
Let's sing

01:25:31.373 --> 01:25:33.429
This is not a Karaoke bar

01:25:34.439 --> 01:25:35.735
We don't have time

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:36.962
We'll split this

01:25:37.139 --> 01:25:37.696
Too much

01:25:37.972 --> 01:25:39.370
Not at all

01:25:39.638 --> 01:25:40.899
Enough

01:25:42.538 --> 01:25:43.765
Cheers

01:25:45.871 --> 01:25:48.337
You'll get drunk

01:25:50.504 --> 01:25:52.527
Drink it

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:58.497
1... 2... 3...

01:25:58.670 --> 01:25:59.601
Down!

01:26:11.268 --> 01:26:12.460
Still kicking. Thank God

01:26:33.399 --> 01:26:35.126
She's safe here

01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:41.692
Here she is

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:55.818
Gloria, Bu

01:26:56.196 --> 01:26:57.253
Gloria's a good friend

01:26:58.563 --> 01:27:00.391
She's the one impersonating me?

01:27:00.862 --> 01:27:01.259
Yes!

01:27:01.428 --> 01:27:02.325
Not bad

01:27:07.395 --> 01:27:09.417
You knew all along

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.319
Why con me?

01:27:14.726 --> 01:27:15.885
You started it

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:21.017
All the love I felt between us

01:27:21.193 --> 01:27:25.818
That was just an act?

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:28.614
Our happiness was no act

01:27:29.459 --> 01:27:30.447
If you like,

01:27:31.258 --> 01:27:32.655
stay in Hong Kong

01:27:34.257 --> 01:27:35.621
What am I?

01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:38.884
One of your women?

01:27:43.824 --> 01:27:46.381
The bottle sent me to you

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.619
A fairy tale becomes...

01:27:52.422 --> 01:27:54.081
a nightmare

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.680
My big mouth

01:28:13.486 --> 01:28:14.543
No

01:28:15.419 --> 01:28:16.407
Get her back

01:28:16.718 --> 01:28:17.241
No

01:28:22.019 --> 01:28:24.143
Weren't we on the same plane?

01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:26.948
Back to Taiwan?

01:28:27.218 --> 01:28:27.706
Yes

01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:29.273
You had fun?

01:28:30.150 --> 01:28:30.878
It was okay

01:28:31.717 --> 01:28:33.080
I bought a lot,

01:28:33.317 --> 01:28:34.283
what about you?

01:28:36.316 --> 01:28:37.509
I...

01:28:37.917 --> 01:28:39.212
I bought a story

01:28:39.616 --> 01:28:40.911
A story!

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.445
Is it in an office building?

01:28:56.381 --> 01:28:57.176
The government passed a law...

01:28:57.347 --> 01:28:58.937
prohibiting the use...

01:28:59.413 --> 01:29:00.572
of non-bio-degradable

01:29:00.747 --> 01:29:02.679
styrofoam

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:03.740
LW's stock...

01:29:03.913 --> 01:29:06.970
dropped drastically

01:29:07.479 --> 01:29:09.877
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:11.767
Major stockholders,

01:29:11.945 --> 01:29:13.206
are dumping them

01:29:13.512 --> 01:29:14.136
You knew...

01:29:14.312 --> 01:29:16.209
the law would be passed?

01:29:17.545 --> 01:29:19.306
It was only a matter of time

01:29:19.478 --> 01:29:21.307
Should we borrow money?

01:29:21.478 --> 01:29:22.773
Up to you guys

01:29:23.211 --> 01:29:23.835
Mr. Chan,

01:29:24.011 --> 01:29:26.408
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

01:29:26.710 --> 01:29:28.573
Just to...

01:29:28.743 --> 01:29:29.674
get even

01:29:29.976 --> 01:29:31.237
I won't

01:29:32.543 --> 01:29:33.668
That's all for today

01:29:33.843 --> 01:29:34.399
The acquisition...

01:29:34.576 --> 01:29:36.565
is a go?

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:37.533
I'll let you know

01:30:53.298 --> 01:31:02.821
Love is like falling maples

01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:05.255
Like what?

01:31:06.463 --> 01:31:11.327
Like falling maples

01:31:11.496 --> 01:31:13.086
What does that mean?

01:31:13.929 --> 01:31:14.758
I don't know

01:31:17.095 --> 01:31:19.617
I've never seen you like this

01:31:19.795 --> 01:31:21.352
Paper everywhere

01:31:22.095 --> 01:31:23.560
Just do...

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:25.626
what you have to do

01:31:26.328 --> 01:31:26.986
Again?

01:31:27.528 --> 01:31:28.652
Forget it

01:31:29.961 --> 01:31:30.517
What?

01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:32.256
Nothing

01:31:32.493 --> 01:31:33.981
Leave me alone

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:40.483
Fine, be that way

01:31:43.192 --> 01:31:44.919
You broke it?

01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:45.950
Good guess

01:31:47.358 --> 01:31:47.847
Sir

01:31:48.024 --> 01:31:48.820
Call 911

01:31:49.124 --> 01:31:50.112
They'll stop me

01:31:50.458 --> 01:31:51.116
Just call

01:32:00.723 --> 01:32:02.416
See

01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:03.385
What do you want?

01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:04.914
You ruined our boss,

01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:06.120
lost us our jobs

01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:08.411
We came for payback

01:32:10.922 --> 01:32:12.148
Mr. Chan

01:32:14.288 --> 01:32:15.844
I heard you're back in training

01:32:16.088 --> 01:32:16.644
Yes, I am

01:32:17.088 --> 01:32:17.815
Rematch?

01:32:18.321 --> 01:32:19.344
Mr. Lo sent you?

01:32:19.588 --> 01:32:20.554
Mr. Lo is broke

01:32:21.321 --> 01:32:22.582
It's not about money

01:32:24.354 --> 01:32:25.785
Not now

01:32:26.753 --> 01:32:27.878
You got no choice

01:32:31.819 --> 01:32:33.910
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

01:32:35.385 --> 01:32:36.783
Only with the best

01:32:43.618 --> 01:32:46.708
What are they talking about?

01:32:47.251 --> 01:32:48.648
You never learned English...

01:32:48.817 --> 01:32:49.612
in school?

01:32:49.851 --> 01:32:50.714
C'mon, tell me

01:32:51.784 --> 01:32:52.306
No

01:32:56.482 --> 01:32:57.379
Okay

01:33:03.449 --> 01:33:04.210
Rules?

01:33:04.381 --> 01:33:05.278
No rules

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:11.140
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

01:33:19.713 --> 01:33:20.940
You like white

01:33:31.378 --> 01:33:32.207
Are you sure?

01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:34.774
I'm sure

01:34:56.968 --> 01:34:57.797
Good training

01:35:52.928 --> 01:35:53.984
Wait

01:36:15.724 --> 01:36:16.712
Now what?

01:36:18.157 --> 01:36:20.146
"What's you okay?" In English?

01:36:20.623 --> 01:36:21.816
Are you okay?

01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:23.485
Are you okay?

01:36:25.889 --> 01:36:26.820
Okay

01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:46.116
Pretty good

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:49.415
I'm coming

01:37:55.145 --> 01:37:55.838
Ready?

01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:26.768
Come on

01:38:30.307 --> 01:38:32.739
Smile, don't worry

01:39:10.536 --> 01:39:11.433
Are you ready?

01:39:29.866 --> 01:39:31.764
Come on

01:40:36.125 --> 01:40:37.954
Don't worry, be happy

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:14.649
Let's dance

01:41:37.284 --> 01:41:37.977
Let's finish

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:00.298
Get up

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.437
On your feet

01:43:08.072 --> 01:43:09.060
You okay?

01:43:20.338 --> 01:43:21.099
Yes

01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:23.800
You won

01:43:24.137 --> 01:43:24.728
I lost

01:43:25.437 --> 01:43:25.993
Why?

01:43:26.836 --> 01:43:27.563
Pound for pound

01:43:27.736 --> 01:43:30.202
He'd have beaten me in no time

01:43:31.336 --> 01:43:32.427
See if he's all right

01:43:35.868 --> 01:43:36.925
You smell turpentine?

01:43:37.302 --> 01:43:38.733
The boss is setting a fire

01:43:40.802 --> 01:43:42.028
Fantastic

01:43:42.834 --> 01:43:43.857
But we'll go to jail

01:43:44.034 --> 01:43:44.931
Prison!

01:43:46.034 --> 01:43:47.522
This is nuts

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:48.966
Watch it

01:43:49.833 --> 01:43:51.026
No sweat

01:43:51.733 --> 01:43:53.824
Hey, jail sucks, boss

01:43:55.633 --> 01:44:00.462
You checked there's nobody inside?

01:44:00.699 --> 01:44:01.824
Sure did

01:44:01.999 --> 01:44:03.056
Good

01:44:03.598 --> 01:44:06.393
Give this to dad

01:44:06.831 --> 01:44:08.694
Tell him I love him

01:44:09.631 --> 01:44:11.426
Give this to C.N.

01:44:11.664 --> 01:44:14.596
Tell him I hate him

01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:17.457
This is for the cops

01:44:17.964 --> 01:44:20.293
I'm claiming all responsibility

01:44:20.596 --> 01:44:22.528
Really?

01:44:22.696 --> 01:44:23.787
You're going to jail, not us?

01:44:27.929 --> 01:44:29.019
Me neither

01:44:30.895 --> 01:44:32.225
Stand aside

01:44:34.095 --> 01:44:35.822
C.N. And I go down together

01:44:35.994 --> 01:44:37.620
Don't do it, boss

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:40.450
My eyes hurt

01:44:41.493 --> 01:44:43.220
But so what?

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.787
I'm going to die anyway

01:44:46.226 --> 01:44:48.555
Bye, Mary

01:44:52.326 --> 01:44:53.848
Calm down, LW

01:44:54.492 --> 01:44:57.946
It's all your fault

01:44:58.191 --> 01:44:59.248
You took it too far

01:44:59.625 --> 01:45:01.022
Dad kicked me off the Board

01:45:01.224 --> 01:45:03.281
I have nothing now

01:45:03.457 --> 01:45:04.582
I'm finished

01:45:05.657 --> 01:45:07.748
What about us, boss?

01:45:07.957 --> 01:45:09.150
Are we finished too?

01:45:09.656 --> 01:45:10.145
You're asking me?

01:45:10.324 --> 01:45:11.381
Yes

01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:13.212
Shut up

01:45:15.656 --> 01:45:16.951
Boss

01:45:18.689 --> 01:45:19.450
Okay now?

01:45:19.622 --> 01:45:20.451
Warmer still

01:45:21.655 --> 01:45:22.211
How's that?

01:45:22.522 --> 01:45:23.317
Just right

01:45:25.092 --> 01:45:25.989
Your eyes still hurt?

01:45:28.459 --> 01:45:29.550
Why be so nice to me?

01:45:29.892 --> 01:45:30.721
You wanted to ruin me

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:33.217
Styrofoam's bad...

01:45:33.392 --> 01:45:35.414
for the environment

01:45:36.058 --> 01:45:37.853
It needs to be regulated

01:45:38.059 --> 01:45:40.819
That motivated my acquisition

01:45:41.224 --> 01:45:42.519
Let's be partners

01:45:42.824 --> 01:45:45.756
In recycling paper

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:48.745
That's not like you

01:45:49.491 --> 01:45:50.922
Ever since grade school

01:45:51.257 --> 01:45:52.517
You've had to beat me

01:45:53.156 --> 01:45:54.850
In whatever we do

01:45:55.056 --> 01:45:57.113
You stole my girlfriends

01:45:57.656 --> 01:46:00.554
And then dumped them

01:46:00.723 --> 01:46:01.711
Never really loved them

01:46:02.423 --> 01:46:03.286
I hated you so

01:46:04.289 --> 01:46:05.516
I hated you too

01:46:06.022 --> 01:46:07.578
Really? What for?

01:46:07.655 --> 01:46:08.643
For always laughing

01:46:09.255 --> 01:46:10.914
For being born so rich

01:46:11.988 --> 01:46:13.079
For your name

01:46:13.555 --> 01:46:15.645
Low Wow is a stupid name

01:46:17.122 --> 01:46:18.451
I hated you most

01:46:18.722 --> 01:46:20.914
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

01:46:22.235 --> 01:46:24.030
So it boils down to Ann

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.459
But she dumped me

01:46:30.967 --> 01:46:32.865
She married that...

01:46:33.034 --> 01:46:36.363
Andy Law Andy Law

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.583
That nerd

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:40.551
So dull

01:46:44.819 --> 01:46:46.046
We fought for so many years

01:46:47.053 --> 01:46:49.109
But we each haven't committed

01:46:49.752 --> 01:46:51.513
To loving only one woman

01:46:51.918 --> 01:46:54.713
But what about Mary?

01:46:54.885 --> 01:46:55.942
She's nothing

01:46:56.384 --> 01:46:57.441
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

01:46:58.284 --> 01:46:59.772
Weren't you engaged?

01:46:59.851 --> 01:47:00.874
What happened?

01:47:03.051 --> 01:47:05.107
I copped out

01:47:08.150 --> 01:47:09.740
but she's one great dame

01:47:10.173 --> 01:47:14.036
We were so happy together

01:47:14.716 --> 01:47:17.681
Laughing all day long

01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:22.205
Wish I could turn the clock back

01:47:24.614 --> 01:47:27.546
But she moved overseas

01:47:28.914 --> 01:47:30.504
I lost track of her

01:47:33.247 --> 01:47:35.405
What's wrong?

01:47:38.113 --> 01:47:38.942
See you later

01:47:40.246 --> 01:47:43.643
Did I say something?

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:49.174
Skipper

01:47:50.046 --> 01:47:50.943
Your Bu is back

01:47:51.312 --> 01:47:55.574
Yes, she is. Cheers

01:47:55.945 --> 01:47:59.536
Skipper, cheers

01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:12.738
What's that?

01:48:14.576 --> 01:48:15.633
Going to college?

01:48:16.975 --> 01:48:18.168
Considering it

01:48:21.409 --> 01:48:22.567
You've changed

01:48:24.141 --> 01:48:26.573
Love changes people

01:48:29.941 --> 01:48:31.304
Don't rush...

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.269
to forget him

01:48:35.673 --> 01:48:38.003
Or it'll get worse

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:40.062
One day

01:48:40.673 --> 01:48:42.036
You take a shower

01:48:42.206 --> 01:48:42.864
Listen to music

01:48:43.606 --> 01:48:45.503
And suddenly remember him

01:48:46.505 --> 01:48:49.266
Then you've forgotten him

01:48:54.138 --> 01:48:56.069
You're pretty when you smile

01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:00.765
Bu

01:49:04.803 --> 01:49:05.530
Albert

01:49:05.703 --> 01:49:07.032
Where have you been?

01:49:07.602 --> 01:49:09.465
I was so worried

01:49:14.368 --> 01:49:15.527
You're not...

01:49:15.901 --> 01:49:17.299
really my type

01:49:20.835 --> 01:49:23.062
I like older men

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.597
I'm older than you

01:49:26.834 --> 01:49:28.094
I mean here

01:49:29.099 --> 01:49:30.030
Here?

01:49:30.833 --> 01:49:32.458
If I were your girl

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:34.595
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

01:49:38.465 --> 01:49:39.725
You'll get it

01:49:40.132 --> 01:49:40.893
I miss you so

01:49:41.299 --> 01:49:42.628
I was so worried about you

01:49:44.464 --> 01:49:46.191
This must be your mother

01:49:46.664 --> 01:49:47.323
This is...

01:49:47.697 --> 01:49:49.822
Albert, my pal

01:49:53.463 --> 01:49:56.553
Can you be my adopted brother?

01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:58.352
Good idea

01:49:58.696 --> 01:49:59.593
I'm the adopted mother?

01:50:00.696 --> 01:50:01.457
Wait

01:50:03.162 --> 01:50:04.593
Why not? Mom

01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.694
Son

01:50:06.195 --> 01:50:06.661
Mom

01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:09.350
My Albert

01:50:09.528 --> 01:50:09.959
Mom

01:50:42.057 --> 01:50:43.148
Bu! Bu!

01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:44.149
I missed you

01:50:46.123 --> 01:50:47.453
You miss me?

01:50:53.255 --> 01:50:54.186
Come back

01:50:55.055 --> 01:50:55.783
Bu!

01:50:58.655 --> 01:50:59.484
Bu!

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:31.948
Bu!

01:51:34.551 --> 01:51:35.209
Scram

01:51:35.917 --> 01:51:38.008
It's you who bullied my daughter

01:51:38.184 --> 01:51:38.945
No, I didn't

01:51:39.284 --> 01:51:40.147
You did too

01:51:40.817 --> 01:51:43.839
She used to laugh all the time

01:51:44.216 --> 01:51:46.909
Now she hardly smiles

01:51:47.283 --> 01:51:50.180
My heart aches for her

01:51:50.749 --> 01:51:53.237
What did you do to her?

01:51:53.815 --> 01:51:55.338
Nothing

01:51:55.614 --> 01:51:57.341
Then why is she like this?

01:51:57.948 --> 01:51:59.675
Please let me talk to her

01:51:59.914 --> 01:52:01.607
Just...

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.837
leave her alone

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:06.544
I don't speak Taiwanese

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.541
He said leave her alone

01:52:08.712 --> 01:52:09.643
Beat it

01:52:13.046 --> 01:52:13.602
Bu!

01:52:15.345 --> 01:52:16.208
Bu!

01:52:16.845 --> 01:52:17.334
Get lost

01:52:17.512 --> 01:52:18.000
Bu

01:52:18.245 --> 01:52:18.710
Hit the road

01:52:20.145 --> 01:52:20.667
I...

01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:37.571
It's all right

01:52:48.008 --> 01:52:49.598
You bullied my niece

01:53:07.572 --> 01:53:08.196
Sir

01:53:19.604 --> 01:53:21.069
I'll just sit here

01:53:21.603 --> 01:53:23.069
Don't walk past me

01:53:24.236 --> 01:53:26.498
You dad's a cool dude

01:53:30.836 --> 01:53:33.358
Sir, you okay?

01:53:34.335 --> 01:53:35.232
Are you hurt?

01:53:35.602 --> 01:53:37.760
Leave us alone

01:53:38.635 --> 01:53:39.965
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

01:53:40.134 --> 01:53:42.066
Waste of time

01:53:42.468 --> 01:53:43.728
Bu, I...

01:53:43.901 --> 01:53:45.060
Shut up

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.293
Bu!

01:53:49.567 --> 01:53:50.396
Shut up

01:53:51.799 --> 01:53:52.322
Bu!

01:53:52.632 --> 01:53:53.257
Shut up

01:53:54.666 --> 01:53:55.155
Bu!

01:53:57.032 --> 01:53:58.396
I'm warning you

01:53:59.065 --> 01:53:59.894
Either you kill me

01:54:00.865 --> 01:54:02.263
Or let me talk to her

01:54:06.598 --> 01:54:09.961
All right, come

01:54:11.464 --> 01:54:13.521
Speak up

01:54:15.896 --> 01:54:19.794
Now or never

01:54:20.162 --> 01:54:21.560
Don't disturb them

01:54:21.730 --> 01:54:22.956
I want to hear

01:54:30.095 --> 01:54:30.992
Why bother?

01:54:35.494 --> 01:54:37.050
You left these

01:54:39.394 --> 01:54:40.620
I have plenty

01:54:46.026 --> 01:54:47.924
I brought Chinese pot rice

01:54:49.592 --> 01:54:51.524
It's cold, but it's your favorite

01:54:55.325 --> 01:54:59.256
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

01:55:02.558 --> 01:55:04.114
There's more

01:55:13.789 --> 01:55:15.220
I put a note in each one

01:55:16.322 --> 01:55:17.379
Saying what?

01:55:18.456 --> 01:55:20.546
I love you, I miss you

01:55:21.155 --> 01:55:22.518
Never over 4 words

01:55:23.022 --> 01:55:24.351
took me hours

01:55:26.854 --> 01:55:28.286
Too much work

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.480
Just put $1,000 in each

01:55:30.854 --> 01:55:31.979
And you have me

01:55:45.086 --> 01:55:47.415
So do you love me?

01:55:48.618 --> 01:55:49.379
I love you

01:55:51.185 --> 01:55:52.741
Since when?

01:55:53.718 --> 01:55:55.274
Since you stole my name-card

01:55:57.451 --> 01:55:59.212
What wish did you make...

01:55:59.384 --> 01:56:00.576
on the boat?

01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:04.738
It's already come true

01:56:08.716 --> 01:56:10.545
Why do you cry?

01:56:13.482 --> 01:56:14.448
Kiss her

01:56:15.449 --> 01:56:17.676
Kiss her

01:56:17.915 --> 01:56:19.847
I'll say it in Cantonese

01:56:20.581 --> 01:56:21.569
Kiss her

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:31.741
You're...

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.238
Xiaojun

01:56:33.612 --> 01:56:35.271
Do I know you?

01:56:36.079 --> 01:56:37.443
I'm your neighbor

01:56:37.912 --> 01:56:39.741
Wow, fantastic!

01:56:40.145 --> 01:56:40.701
Why?

01:56:41.845 --> 01:56:42.833
Oh, weather is fine

01:56:57.609 --> 01:56:58.597
Look at them

01:57:13.008 --> 01:57:14.598
The women here are gorgeous

01:57:14.808 --> 01:57:15.239
I should have...

01:57:15.407 --> 01:57:16.100
Go to hell

01:57:16.674 --> 01:57:19.162
I want you to meet my dolphin

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:20.129
Really?

01:57:20.406 --> 01:57:23.167
Bu! Bu!

01:57:23.406 --> 01:57:24.167
Wow!
