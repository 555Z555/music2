00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:07.942
100 years ago,

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.808
this island in Taiwan...

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:13.043
had nothing

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010
Only romance

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:20.344
Legend has it

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.370
There were two lovers

00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:24.344
And one day

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:28.668
The man was fishing

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.111
His boat sank

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:33.207
The woman...

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:35.836
saw it onshore

00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:38.009
She swam out

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.373
No one ever saw them again

00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:43.904
Some say

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.108
they became dolphins

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:51.838
All dolphins around this island...

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:55.942
came from them

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:06.964
They all make...

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.799
"Bu... Bu" noises

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:25.531
Nice story?

00:02:30.738 --> 00:02:32.566
So snooty

00:02:34.503 --> 00:02:37.025
You told a horror story

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:41.367
Don't get involved

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.902
Have some melon

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:46.463
No

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.492
You're like...

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.100
those dolphins

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.757
So picky

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.126
You named me Bu

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:58.160
I've told you so often

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.796
Don't mix Mandarin...

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:02.126
with Cantonese

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.595
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.823
are now both accented

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.823
You teach her Mandarin then

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.826
Get off my case

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.625
That's Cantonese again

00:03:20.398 --> 00:03:21.795
Which I don't speak

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.490
What did you say?

00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:28.225
Tell me

00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:33.522
Skipper Restaurant

00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.224
Open bar, folks

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.549
One more round

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.985
Drink up

00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:10.555
Go in and take a seat

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:14.055
Long time no see

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.148
One more round?

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:23.914
Not tonight

00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:25.712
Can't afford it

00:04:26.023 --> 00:04:28.488
On the house

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.677
Bu, 6 beers, on me

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.314
They come everyday

00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:36.454
Never pay

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:38.050
Add water...

00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:39.449
to the beer

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.552
That trick again?

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:44.377
Bu Yes?

00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:45.951
Hurry

00:04:46.487 --> 00:04:47.884
Here

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.747
Did you add water?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.943
No!

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.946
No, very good

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:54.419
C'mon

00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:58.109
Cheers

00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:09.450
Why, Bu?

00:05:11.418 --> 00:05:12.440
Idiot

00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:15.410
You could've spared me

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:20.445
They sing

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.806
Watch TV

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:25.512
Or pick fights

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:27.844
This island

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:29.605
Has no room...

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:31.036
for romance

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.642
Done

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:55.476
Beautiful

00:05:55.645 --> 00:05:56.338
I learned it...

00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:57.909
from a magazine

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.808
Bu

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.236
I brought you something

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:12.464
I've never seen...

00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:15.708
an oyster this big

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:18.499
Any pearls?

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:20.175
No

00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:26.106
Must be expensive

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:27.599
NT$3,000

00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:31.869
Thanks

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.404
And this

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.603
It's my friend's shop

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:39.997
He'll give us a discount

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:41.865
I'm...

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.396
Proposing?

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.264
No, I just want to...

00:06:47.438 --> 00:06:48.699
Yes, I'm proposing

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:51.895
With...

00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:53.900
a big oyster?

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.228
Of course not

00:06:55.404 --> 00:06:56.700
The oyster's not...

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.331
Marry me

00:07:01.837 --> 00:07:02.598
Okay

00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:06.362
I'll consider it

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:22.193
Poor Longyi

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:23.797
This oyster's not cheap

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:27.626
He proposed to me

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:29.959
Really?

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:32.090
You love him?

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.995
Well, he's actually...

00:07:36.732 --> 00:07:37.992
Not bad

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.160
Your answer

00:07:40.332 --> 00:07:41.729
Shouldn't be over 4 words

00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:43.488
You love him, or you don't

00:07:58.163 --> 00:08:00.685
You left Hong Kong...

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:02.123
to marry dad, why?

00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:04.650
He was quite a hunk

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:07.717
A good cook too

00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:10.451
You're a good cook

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:12.053
He's better

00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:15.290
He cooks with love

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.022
What's loving someone like?

00:08:25.393 --> 00:08:28.586
You miss him

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:32.185
The sight of him thrills you

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.816
You ache

00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:36.324
When he's gone

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:42.185
You could watch him forever

00:08:42.824 --> 00:08:44.381
Even when he's sleeping

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.379
You're in love

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:49.921
If you feel like that

00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:51.618
Okay?

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.776
You miss Hong Kong?

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:11.551
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:12.747
I see

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.947
You don't love Longyi

00:09:18.187 --> 00:09:19.709
Take mama's advice

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:22.215
Trust your heart

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:24.981
Do what you have to do

00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:33.277
Bu

00:09:46.283 --> 00:09:47.805
Hey, kid

00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:50.978
Got some news

00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:53.539
Longyi proposed

00:09:55.182 --> 00:09:56.408
Don't laugh

00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.244
Somebody said

00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:07.545
Men and women...

00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:09.907
exist in pairs

00:10:10.446 --> 00:10:14.241
Till separated on earth

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:18.968
Then they go through life

00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:22.110
Searching for one another

00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:25.369
Bu

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:27.541
Where are you going?

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.942
Bu!

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.962
I'm waiting for you!

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.436
Hong Kong, Albert?

00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:05.762
How romantic!

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:02.787
You're telling me something?

00:12:04.132 --> 00:12:06.461
You choose for me

00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:04.148
You just decided my future

00:13:09.024 --> 00:13:10.216
Excuse me

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.083
You know a good cafe?

00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:15.955
Sure, we'll go together

00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:17.279
Thanks

00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:28.049
Typical Taiwanese!

00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:30.248
Pardon me?

00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:32.286
You speak Cantonese?

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:33.384
Surprised?

00:13:44.186 --> 00:13:45.811
Never flown before?

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:46.780
It shows?

00:13:47.153 --> 00:13:48.413
Yes

00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:52.642
You can get lost in Hong Kong

00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:54.575
I'll show you around

00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:56.346
I know...

00:13:56.718 --> 00:13:57.876
all the trendy spots

00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:00.374
I have fans everywhere

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.016
I'm a fun guy

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:03.380
Okay?

00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:14.011
What?

00:14:14.516 --> 00:14:15.573
Are you twins?

00:14:18.848 --> 00:14:19.779
Please forgive me

00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:22.777
Excuse me

00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:25.980
Gangster's girlfriend

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:27.841
disappears

00:14:57.877 --> 00:15:00.240
Morning, sir, working out?

00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:02.775
No time

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.938
Bill, are you ready?

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.469
Good

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:27.631
Let's start

00:15:31.606 --> 00:15:32.594
Morning, Mr. Chan

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:35.334
Any news from Wall Street?

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:36.368
Lion Fund...

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:39.402
is borrowing heavily

00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:41.898
Even at...

00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:43.764
a 20% interbank rate

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.561
Check the following

00:15:50.003 --> 00:15:51.230
How many Nikkei Futures...

00:15:51.403 --> 00:15:53.130
did they short?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:56.130
Is Yen...

00:15:56.302 --> 00:15:57.927
appreciating?

00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:01.100
Is the lease for the US base...

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.393
in Japan expiring?

00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:05.261
If both answer are affirmative

00:16:05.535 --> 00:16:06.898
Buy whatever they sell

00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:08.395
But this hedge fund

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.692
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

00:16:10.868 --> 00:16:13.390
Should be invincible

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.957
They're too greedy

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.925
on margin trading

00:16:17.234 --> 00:16:19.062
Leveraging 10 times their worth

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:20.324
They're doomed

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.822
So go ahead

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:22.965
Yes, Mr. Chan

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:23.891
Thank you

00:16:31.664 --> 00:16:33.289
Send this with 100 roses...

00:16:33.464 --> 00:16:35.054
to Carman

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:37.020
During office hours

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.562
Didn't you break up?

00:16:40.497 --> 00:16:41.428
We're still friends

00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:46.521
Find someone and

00:16:46.696 --> 00:16:49.560
settle down

00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:50.757
Like who?

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:53.384
Those women around you

00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:57.955
All so beautiful and elegant

00:16:58.528 --> 00:17:00.016
Too elegant for me

00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:02.654
What do you want?

00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:05.052
Someone amusing

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.651
Make yourself at home

00:18:13.018 --> 00:18:15.609
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

00:18:18.384 --> 00:18:19.611
And you came...

00:18:20.284 --> 00:18:21.749
all that way

00:18:22.784 --> 00:18:24.773
How brave and romantic

00:18:29.083 --> 00:18:31.174
However...

00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:32.806
What?

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.447
I...

00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:37.480
What?

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:45.971
I'm gay

00:18:50.414 --> 00:18:51.607
No

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:52.941
Yes

00:18:53.114 --> 00:18:53.841
Really?

00:18:54.214 --> 00:18:55.009
Really

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.139
No

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.102
Yes

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:57.802
Honest?

00:18:57.979 --> 00:18:58.570
Honest

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:04.201
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:05.940
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:06.578
What?

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:07.643
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:10.135
Such a waste

00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:11.809
Why?

00:19:12.177 --> 00:19:14.302
You're a hunk

00:19:14.478 --> 00:19:16.034
I'm not

00:19:26.043 --> 00:19:27.474
That's stunning

00:19:28.976 --> 00:19:31.998
That's what inspired you

00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:35.265
I moved here because of it

00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:42.170
Find a motel tonight

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.006
Fly home tomorrow

00:19:44.407 --> 00:19:47.396
I've never traveled

00:19:47.574 --> 00:19:49.267
This is a first

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.769
Think I'll stay a while

00:19:51.573 --> 00:19:52.698
But Hong Kong...

00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:54.263
is boring

00:19:55.072 --> 00:19:56.163
Fly back tomorrow

00:19:56.605 --> 00:19:58.400
My friend said

00:19:58.805 --> 00:19:59.896
Hong Kong's fun

00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:03.665
Great restaurants too

00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:06.602
I'll find you...

00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:07.668
a motel

00:20:08.738 --> 00:20:10.567
I can't afford one

00:20:10.803 --> 00:20:11.565
Hands off Wait

00:20:13.037 --> 00:20:14.969
Let me stay here

00:20:15.137 --> 00:20:16.693
Women can't stay here

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:18.925
I'll go nuts

00:20:20.535 --> 00:20:21.933
Please

00:20:22.103 --> 00:20:23.932
Sorry Please

00:20:28.968 --> 00:20:32.491
I came all this way

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:35.431
To such a big let down

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:39.258
I don't deserve this

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:43.821
Goodbye

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:50.497
Bu

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:51.029
What?

00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:51.994
Your suitcase

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:15.054
Your bag

00:21:17.862 --> 00:21:20.020
I can't stand crying

00:21:20.894 --> 00:21:22.326
Makes me feel so guilty

00:21:22.761 --> 00:21:23.852
Okay, stay

00:21:24.195 --> 00:21:27.160
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.655
I'm a makeup artist

00:21:30.993 --> 00:21:33.255
Best...

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.717
in Hong Kong

00:21:46.925 --> 00:21:47.482
Exquisite

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:52.047
That's it

00:22:13.955 --> 00:22:15.012
Hold that

00:22:18.054 --> 00:22:18.849
Good

00:22:36.085 --> 00:22:38.312
I'm starving

00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:39.508
We'll wrap soon

00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:41.482
How much longer?

00:22:42.451 --> 00:22:43.541
6 hours

00:22:44.617 --> 00:22:46.139
What?

00:22:46.384 --> 00:22:49.316
Keep that door shut

00:22:49.817 --> 00:22:51.340
We're reloading

00:22:51.683 --> 00:22:53.239
You'll fog the film

00:23:30.645 --> 00:23:33.304
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:35.610
No... no emergency

00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:38.502
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.974
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:46.107
Tell me, what's going on?

00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:52.202
Maybe you'd better go

00:24:17.239 --> 00:24:19.102
C.N. You're cruising and

00:24:19.273 --> 00:24:20.533
didn't invite me?

00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:23.171
Why bother, here you are

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.129
The press says you're romancing my girl

00:24:25.738 --> 00:24:26.795
You believe them?

00:24:27.205 --> 00:24:28.397
Grow up, LW

00:24:30.704 --> 00:24:32.363
Is it true?

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:33.626
Yes

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.627
We've been competing since grade school

00:24:49.135 --> 00:24:50.464
You've been interested in...

00:24:50.635 --> 00:24:51.566
our stock lately

00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:53.232
I'm interested in all stocks,

00:24:53.401 --> 00:24:54.492
not just yours

00:24:55.701 --> 00:24:57.098
My associates and I

00:24:57.434 --> 00:25:00.025
Hold a majority of the shares

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.857
You can't touch my company

00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:03.825
We'll see

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.959
You're on my yacht

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:09.595
Dating my girl

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.265
And you talk to me like this

00:25:12.765 --> 00:25:14.560
Why did you want me here?

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:18.631
For an apology

00:25:20.697 --> 00:25:22.458
To make it easier on you

00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:24.424
I'm leaving now

00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:26.863
Call me...

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.893
to apologize in...

00:25:29.897 --> 00:25:30.658
5 minutes

00:25:32.863 --> 00:25:33.886
What time is it?

00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:36.587
5:30

00:25:37.829 --> 00:25:38.920
Why wear...

00:25:39.096 --> 00:25:39.823
a watch

00:25:40.062 --> 00:25:41.084
That can't tell time

00:25:41.629 --> 00:25:43.322
I like the diamonds

00:25:45.228 --> 00:25:46.091
Watch him

00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:48.989
If he doesn't call me in five

00:25:49.528 --> 00:25:50.857
Throw him overboard

00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:53.658
But give him a buoy

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.553
Yes, boss

00:25:55.226 --> 00:25:55.749
Call me

00:26:08.758 --> 00:26:09.689
Bye, boss

00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:13.886
Call him

00:26:14.324 --> 00:26:15.312
Or you'll get wet

00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:17.252
Make it snappy

00:26:17.423 --> 00:26:19.855
I've got a hot date

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.881
Don't force us to do it

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.083
Get a buoy

00:26:24.257 --> 00:26:24.984
Right

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.380
Come

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.614
Hands off

00:26:27.923 --> 00:26:28.445
Easy

00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:35.843
Almost

00:26:42.587 --> 00:26:43.110
Bye

00:26:43.521 --> 00:26:44.612
Here comes the buoy

00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:45.481
It's Fatty

00:26:47.087 --> 00:26:48.417
Fatty fell over

00:26:53.086 --> 00:26:54.177
Don't go

00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:02.581
Help him up

00:27:02.785 --> 00:27:03.716
Over there

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.775
Scared me

00:27:51.812 --> 00:27:52.903
You okay?

00:27:53.179 --> 00:27:53.803
I'm fine

00:28:08.943 --> 00:28:09.670
Call you

00:28:19.975 --> 00:28:20.703
Where is he?

00:28:31.507 --> 00:28:33.064
Where is he?

00:28:33.774 --> 00:28:34.467
You okay?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.037
Don't fall over again

00:28:40.106 --> 00:28:41.969
You! He's here!

00:28:44.172 --> 00:28:44.933
In the rear

00:28:45.738 --> 00:28:47.068
Help...

00:28:49.172 --> 00:28:50.432
Hold tight

00:28:51.138 --> 00:28:52.399
Close

00:28:56.238 --> 00:28:57.225
You see him?

00:28:57.971 --> 00:28:58.527
No

00:28:58.871 --> 00:28:59.336
Look again

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.027
Over there

00:29:34.532 --> 00:29:35.828
He got away

00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:36.623
Wait

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.589
The boss wanted him...

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:40.595
overboard with a buoy

00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:41.956
Job's done, right?

00:29:42.232 --> 00:29:43.129
Right

00:29:43.397 --> 00:29:44.886
It's a wrap

00:30:14.094 --> 00:30:15.082
Thanks

00:30:15.927 --> 00:30:16.722
You okay?

00:30:18.993 --> 00:30:20.619
You're...

00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:22.388
Name's Bu

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.316
Bu?

00:30:26.292 --> 00:30:27.121
You a refugee?

00:30:28.658 --> 00:30:29.749
Yes

00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:31.947
From Vietnam?

00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.748
Right again

00:30:35.791 --> 00:30:37.121
How many of you?

00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:38.782
Just me, why?

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.213
Who's driving?

00:30:54.956 --> 00:30:55.853
Give me a hand

00:30:56.388 --> 00:31:00.615
I can't, I'm starving

00:31:01.388 --> 00:31:02.410
Aren't you?

00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:06.181
No, but I could use a snack

00:31:14.587 --> 00:31:18.848
Let's talk

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:20.007
so I forget the hunger

00:31:20.853 --> 00:31:21.580
About what?

00:31:23.818 --> 00:31:26.284
What do you like?

00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:30.973
Nothing?

00:31:31.518 --> 00:31:33.847
Not even cars and women?

00:31:36.617 --> 00:31:39.174
Don't just smile

00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:41.873
Okay, what don't you like?

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.912
Nosy people

00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:00.277
What don't you like?

00:32:03.447 --> 00:32:07.344
Growing up,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.507
I like being naughty

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.441
Nosy?

00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:12.977
Naughty

00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:14.173
Naughty

00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:15.173
And no one...

00:32:15.812 --> 00:32:18.300
pampers you anymore

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:19.540
What do you like?

00:32:21.878 --> 00:32:23.844
A shower when I'm sweaty

00:32:24.811 --> 00:32:25.969
Snap out of bed...

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.002
to a cup of coffee

00:32:31.777 --> 00:32:33.106
I'd like one now

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:38.502
Hong Kong stars are lovely

00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:40.931
Stars are...

00:32:41.576 --> 00:32:43.666
the same everywhere

00:32:44.342 --> 00:32:46.637
If you care to look at them

00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:52.298
What?

00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:53.907
Shooting star!

00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:55.335
Really?

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:58.234
Mom said when you see one

00:32:58.407 --> 00:33:00.838
Touch your pocket and make a wish

00:33:01.006 --> 00:33:01.903
And it'll come true

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:03.896
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

00:33:05.673 --> 00:33:07.002
Another one

00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:19.429
What's your wish?

00:33:20.404 --> 00:33:22.427
Can't tell you

00:33:28.303 --> 00:33:30.098
Or it won't come true

00:33:33.836 --> 00:33:34.767
I'm so sleepy

00:34:28.662 --> 00:34:29.889
A boat! Help!

00:34:36.195 --> 00:34:38.683
Over here!

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:18.250
The Silicon Valley stocks?

00:35:20.922 --> 00:35:23.320
They'll go even higher

00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:29.314
Check one thing

00:35:30.188 --> 00:35:31.847
Does LW control...

00:35:32.253 --> 00:35:33.049
his company's shares?

00:35:52.418 --> 00:35:53.509
Buy me a new mobile

00:35:55.151 --> 00:35:56.117
It drowned

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.481
There's no transport...

00:36:08.649 --> 00:36:10.138
around here

00:36:10.316 --> 00:36:11.645
I'll give you a ride

00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:15.242
Just tell me where I am

00:36:15.415 --> 00:36:16.506
and I'll walk back

00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:18.510
We're out

00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:21.306
in the boonies, Miss

00:36:21.748 --> 00:36:22.805
Name's Bu

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:25.137
Boo? Bu!

00:36:25.314 --> 00:36:26.870
Just get in

00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:27.637
Sure

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.743
Not you, this lady here

00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:36.706
There are only 2 seats

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:38.040
I know

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:39.909
Here's 20 bucks

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:42.670
Around the corner...

00:36:42.845 --> 00:36:44.606
are buses and cabs

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.964
Compulsive liar

00:37:14.374 --> 00:37:15.170
Come in

00:37:17.674 --> 00:37:19.606
Huge place, you live alone?

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.863
There's a butler

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.430
Must get crowded

00:37:25.406 --> 00:37:26.429
Wait here

00:37:26.707 --> 00:37:27.536
Can I look around?

00:37:27.706 --> 00:37:28.502
Help yourself

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:29.262
Thanks

00:37:44.237 --> 00:37:45.066
I'm starving

00:37:51.437 --> 00:37:53.369
Some food please!

00:38:34.264 --> 00:38:34.958
Need something?

00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:37.023
Fish food

00:38:37.464 --> 00:38:39.487
They're electronic fish

00:38:41.396 --> 00:38:43.056
Come over here

00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:44.761
Why electronic fish?

00:38:45.396 --> 00:38:46.884
I never change the water

00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:48.824
Fish never die, it's perfect

00:38:49.096 --> 00:38:50.027
And if the power's out?

00:38:52.995 --> 00:38:55.859
You invite friends over?

00:38:56.395 --> 00:38:57.122
Don't have any

00:38:57.594 --> 00:38:58.457
So boring, and lonely

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:12.486
Now what?

00:39:14.392 --> 00:39:15.517
You like to fight?

00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:17.519
Some golf,

00:39:18.325 --> 00:39:19.585
some race horses

00:39:20.292 --> 00:39:22.019
I box and work out

00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:24.818
What's the octopus for?

00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:26.290
You're so nosy

00:39:26.924 --> 00:39:27.617
Sorry

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:38.183
This should fit, change in there

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:53.719
Betty, call me a cab

00:39:54.988 --> 00:39:56.214
20 minutes? Great

00:40:24.483 --> 00:40:25.642
There's a room...

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:27.210
behind the mirror

00:40:30.783 --> 00:40:33.476
How would I have known?

00:40:35.982 --> 00:40:36.505
Hungry?

00:40:37.149 --> 00:40:38.705
Starving

00:40:39.082 --> 00:40:40.241
Me too

00:40:40.948 --> 00:40:43.243
Any Chinese pot rice?

00:40:44.048 --> 00:40:45.071
What?

00:40:58.179 --> 00:41:00.111
Best take out food ever

00:41:00.646 --> 00:41:02.111
My favorite

00:41:03.645 --> 00:41:05.270
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

00:41:05.979 --> 00:41:07.035
I hate the smell

00:41:11.045 --> 00:41:13.272
Don't stare. Eat up

00:41:13.778 --> 00:41:14.573
Sure

00:41:31.808 --> 00:41:32.604
Now what?

00:41:32.975 --> 00:41:34.441
You're amusing when you eat

00:41:40.441 --> 00:41:41.270
Are you rich?

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.635
I guess so

00:41:44.573 --> 00:41:45.334
What do you do?

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:46.834
I'm into trash

00:41:47.507 --> 00:41:48.473
C'mon

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:49.962
No, I sell trash

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.930
Be that way

00:42:03.238 --> 00:42:05.101
Can I have a soda?

00:42:05.471 --> 00:42:06.595
Juice is better for you

00:42:30.934 --> 00:42:33.900
Bu took the lift down

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.364
What's wrong?

00:43:06.996 --> 00:43:09.518
Stop moaning

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:13.823
You know

00:43:14.262 --> 00:43:17.853
That bottle's very special

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:18.959
So special that...

00:43:19.528 --> 00:43:21.187
all of a sudden

00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:23.224
I'm feeding and sheltering you

00:43:23.395 --> 00:43:24.156
Just like that

00:43:24.495 --> 00:43:27.392
Remember I told you about...

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.526
C. N? More than once

00:43:29.694 --> 00:43:31.852
Last night...

00:43:32.027 --> 00:43:34.322
You told me that too

00:43:34.826 --> 00:43:38.724
I think he's... nice

00:43:38.925 --> 00:43:39.652
Nice?

00:43:42.825 --> 00:43:45.518
These magazines are published weekly

00:43:45.692 --> 00:43:48.385
And he changes girlfriends just as often

00:43:48.991 --> 00:43:52.423
He's not nice, he's a playboy

00:43:52.591 --> 00:43:53.386
Let's see

00:43:54.157 --> 00:43:55.521
An ex-girlfriend says

00:43:59.923 --> 00:44:03.286
He doesn't say sweet words

00:44:03.756 --> 00:44:06.847
But he's a romantic man

00:44:07.555 --> 00:44:10.612
He appears stem and talks tough

00:44:11.222 --> 00:44:13.279
Inside he's like a kid

00:44:14.254 --> 00:44:17.243
He's competitive and chases novelty

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.218
Never regrets any decision

00:44:21.187 --> 00:44:22.118
With him...

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.647
You feel insecure

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.751
Meaning?

00:44:27.286 --> 00:44:29.376
Chases novelty, so he fools around

00:44:29.986 --> 00:44:31.508
No regrets,

00:44:31.853 --> 00:44:33.182
so he enjoys dumping women

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.317
Maybe those women deserved it

00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:36.949
They were insecure...

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:39.641
to begin with

00:44:39.918 --> 00:44:41.042
Spare me

00:44:44.651 --> 00:44:46.674
Hong Kong's boring anyway

00:44:48.484 --> 00:44:49.108
Going home?

00:44:49.584 --> 00:44:52.447
No, C.N. Is fun

00:44:54.316 --> 00:44:56.305
You have to hook him first

00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:57.643
Can't just walk up

00:44:57.815 --> 00:44:59.610
And take off your clothes

00:44:59.915 --> 00:45:01.710
That sure won't work

00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:03.438
But you never know

00:45:03.882 --> 00:45:04.938
He's competitive and

00:45:05.115 --> 00:45:07.240
chases novelty

00:45:07.547 --> 00:45:09.513
I have a plan, I need your help

00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:10.374
No way

00:45:11.247 --> 00:45:12.713
Please

00:45:14.147 --> 00:45:14.976
Sorry

00:45:17.713 --> 00:45:18.804
Please tell me

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.809
where your daughter is

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.770
She found a bottle

00:45:22.946 --> 00:45:24.310
She's in Hong Kong

00:45:26.379 --> 00:45:28.641
I have to get Bu back

00:45:29.512 --> 00:45:30.307
Chow Yun Fat!

00:45:31.112 --> 00:45:34.441
Mr. Chow

00:45:36.244 --> 00:45:37.800
Wrong guy

00:45:37.977 --> 00:45:38.943
You speak Mandarin?

00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:41.140
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.970
Don't try to fool me

00:45:43.143 --> 00:45:44.870
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.171
Mr. Chow, you're back!

00:45:48.442 --> 00:45:49.567
Fresh form Hollywood?

00:45:49.743 --> 00:45:50.936
Please sign Can I take a picture?

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:53.632
You mind? OK

00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:57.472
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

00:45:57.642 --> 00:46:00.903
My turn, miss

00:46:01.274 --> 00:46:03.535
Point a gun at me

00:46:03.707 --> 00:46:06.138
Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

00:46:06.974 --> 00:46:09.599
Thank you, Mr. Chow

00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:12.730
Give me a hug

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:18.003
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

00:46:18.306 --> 00:46:19.601
I'll send you the photos

00:46:19.772 --> 00:46:21.068
Bye You're so sweet

00:46:21.238 --> 00:46:22.100
Same as the photo

00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:23.159
Print me a copy

00:46:25.005 --> 00:46:26.630
He's such a hunk Bye

00:46:26.804 --> 00:46:27.667
Bye

00:46:29.838 --> 00:46:30.633
My bag!

00:46:37.269 --> 00:46:38.667
We checked LW's company

00:46:39.003 --> 00:46:40.162
Last year,

00:46:40.336 --> 00:46:41.665
rumover grew 13%

00:46:41.902 --> 00:46:44.595
Profit: Over HK$1 billion

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:47.594
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

00:46:48.035 --> 00:46:49.160
We have acquired...

00:46:49.335 --> 00:46:51.527
16% of the company

00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:55.059
LW and his associates...

00:46:55.234 --> 00:46:57.496
still hold 65%

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.857
But...

00:47:00.134 --> 00:47:01.599
they're not selling

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.357
Dump all my stocks

00:47:05.933 --> 00:47:08.296
If we dump them,

00:47:08.466 --> 00:47:09.591
the price will plunge

00:47:09.766 --> 00:47:13.925
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:16.397
Just do it

00:47:19.665 --> 00:47:20.631
I need to see K.K.

00:47:20.931 --> 00:47:21.624
Yes, sir

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.326
Who's K. K?

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.291
Head of Environmental Protection

00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:27.655
Going up or down?

00:48:28.123 --> 00:48:30.418
I was seeing friends upstairs

00:48:30.955 --> 00:48:31.784
There's no upstairs

00:48:33.022 --> 00:48:33.817
Really?

00:48:35.222 --> 00:48:38.187
Actually they live downstairs

00:48:38.455 --> 00:48:39.079
Names?

00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:41.985
I forgot

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.477
So quiet here

00:48:47.853 --> 00:48:50.285
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

00:48:50.486 --> 00:48:51.975
You messed up my wall

00:48:53.986 --> 00:48:55.009
Excuse me?

00:49:02.585 --> 00:49:04.312
Look!

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.041
Easy there

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.743
Let go

00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:15.712
Who sent you?

00:49:16.583 --> 00:49:17.378
Let go first

00:49:19.882 --> 00:49:20.643
Like my writing?

00:49:32.414 --> 00:49:35.039
Enough. I don't know kungfu

00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:36.539
I'm just a messenger

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.404
Message?

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.107
My back pocket

00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:53.370
Bully. You messed up my arm

00:49:53.545 --> 00:49:54.533
Happy reading

00:49:57.011 --> 00:49:57.443
Gangster's girlfriend...

00:49:57.612 --> 00:49:58.202
disappears

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.203
What happened?

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:07.201
Fell down some stairs

00:50:07.377 --> 00:50:08.035
You okay?

00:50:08.277 --> 00:50:08.640
I'll live

00:50:09.177 --> 00:50:11.267
Will he buy...

00:50:11.443 --> 00:50:12.773
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:14.134
How should I know?

00:50:14.709 --> 00:50:15.834
Will it work?

00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:17.365
Of course

00:50:19.675 --> 00:50:20.698
What's next?

00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:22.965
Showtime

00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:24.504
Where are your pals?

00:50:32.374 --> 00:50:33.930
You know we're bad

00:50:34.107 --> 00:50:35.629
We're here to waste you

00:50:36.273 --> 00:50:37.170
React!

00:50:37.772 --> 00:50:38.999
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

00:50:39.173 --> 00:50:42.627
Is a Taiwanese gangster

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.271
The sworn enemy of our boss

00:50:44.439 --> 00:50:46.462
He wants you defaced

00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:48.536
Frog, your turn

00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:50.327
Believe it or not

00:50:50.671 --> 00:50:52.500
You're front page news

00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:55.630
Everyone's looking for you now

00:50:58.904 --> 00:51:00.164
Yes. Looking awesome

00:51:26.434 --> 00:51:27.024
You okay?

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.629
Yes, and you?

00:51:30.633 --> 00:51:31.394
It's you!

00:51:31.633 --> 00:51:32.098
You okay?

00:51:32.299 --> 00:51:32.923
Yes

00:51:38.465 --> 00:51:39.396
I don't know these goons

00:51:39.565 --> 00:51:40.155
What?

00:51:40.498 --> 00:51:40.929
Nothing

00:52:12.428 --> 00:52:13.688
You can't be ID'ed

00:52:15.328 --> 00:52:16.816
They're damn good actors

00:53:27.718 --> 00:53:28.877
Back off

00:53:30.651 --> 00:53:31.082
Stay here

00:53:31.251 --> 00:53:33.308
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

00:53:33.617 --> 00:53:34.708
You're bleeding

00:53:36.784 --> 00:53:38.511
We'll spare you today

00:53:38.784 --> 00:53:40.647
Don't provoke him

00:53:41.716 --> 00:53:43.909
Cops will go after them

00:53:44.183 --> 00:53:44.739
Not us

00:53:46.949 --> 00:53:47.915
Hi, there

00:53:48.282 --> 00:53:54.544
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

00:53:55.114 --> 00:53:55.875
Thanks

00:53:56.381 --> 00:53:58.108
Someone reported a fight

00:53:58.281 --> 00:53:59.008
We were attacked

00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:00.371
They leave any evidence?

00:54:00.714 --> 00:54:01.771
Baseball bats

00:54:03.681 --> 00:54:05.442
Sunny, smell

00:54:06.613 --> 00:54:08.170
Any clues?

00:54:19.145 --> 00:54:21.441
Sunny, you're clueless

00:54:22.078 --> 00:54:23.509
Let's get help

00:54:28.544 --> 00:54:30.032
My site, very safe

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.169
It's so trashy

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:34.839
I told you I sell trash

00:54:35.176 --> 00:54:36.801
Expensive stuff too

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.103
Expensive? Trash is trash

00:54:40.842 --> 00:54:42.068
Before you were...

00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:43.432
a Vietnamese refugee

00:54:43.808 --> 00:54:45.035
Now you're...

00:54:45.342 --> 00:54:47.364
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

00:54:47.908 --> 00:54:49.305
So who are you, really?

00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:52.602
A dangerous woman

00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:53.737
Scared?

00:54:54.507 --> 00:54:55.370
Never

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.499
Thrilled to be with me?

00:55:02.906 --> 00:55:05.201
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

00:55:07.005 --> 00:55:09.698
I lived near a police station

00:55:09.972 --> 00:55:12.733
with posters of wanted criminals

00:55:13.338 --> 00:55:17.565
One of them was a hunk

00:55:18.004 --> 00:55:20.492
I saw his poster everyday

00:55:21.137 --> 00:55:23.898
And I fell in love

00:55:24.203 --> 00:55:24.930
And?

00:55:25.803 --> 00:55:29.098
I found him, stole his heart

00:55:30.036 --> 00:55:31.525
How was he?

00:55:32.602 --> 00:55:36.159
Cute, a great dancer

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:39.856
Really romantic

00:55:41.568 --> 00:55:42.795
For being a dancer?

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.757
You dance?

00:55:46.334 --> 00:55:46.958
Of course

00:55:50.134 --> 00:55:51.031
This?

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:53.758
Sure

00:55:55.666 --> 00:55:56.825
Tango?

00:56:01.532 --> 00:56:02.293
That too

00:56:03.232 --> 00:56:06.322
So common, nothing more exciting?

00:56:06.731 --> 00:56:08.060
Sure Really?

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.928
Teach me

00:56:11.797 --> 00:56:12.626
You'll be scared

00:56:12.864 --> 00:56:13.761
No way

00:56:16.297 --> 00:56:17.285
Hold me

00:56:17.764 --> 00:56:18.922
Give me your legs

00:56:19.196 --> 00:56:20.127
Right

00:56:21.163 --> 00:56:21.787
Ready?

00:56:24.995 --> 00:56:25.858
Help!

00:56:32.061 --> 00:56:32.652
Exciting enough?

00:56:32.828 --> 00:56:33.316
Yes

00:56:33.928 --> 00:56:34.417
No more?

00:56:34.894 --> 00:56:35.485
You aren't scared?

00:56:35.694 --> 00:56:36.353
Never

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:37.960
More moves?

00:56:41.927 --> 00:56:43.790
Just hold tight and

00:56:43.993 --> 00:56:44.720
stay still

00:56:45.093 --> 00:56:46.184
Enjoy the variations

00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:46.823
Really? Okay?

00:56:46.993 --> 00:56:47.549
Okay...

00:56:47.726 --> 00:56:48.384
There

00:56:49.092 --> 00:56:50.648
Run, 1, 2, 3

00:56:59.658 --> 00:57:02.351
Wow! This is fun

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.183
Man's so busy

00:57:06.591 --> 00:57:07.783
Making trash

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.583
The recycling business is a gold mine

00:57:12.189 --> 00:57:12.655
They say...

00:57:12.823 --> 00:57:14.617
What others abandon, I take

00:57:16.123 --> 00:57:17.349
You did well last time

00:57:18.155 --> 00:57:20.678
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:23.554
They all know you're my protégé

00:57:23.821 --> 00:57:24.650
I'm flattered

00:57:24.922 --> 00:57:25.546
Thank you

00:57:26.254 --> 00:57:29.618
Don't thank me, thank yourself

00:57:30.254 --> 00:57:32.651
Any new plans?

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.511
I heard you're buying LW's company

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.542
You know

00:57:40.886 --> 00:57:42.681
what's the best win?

00:57:44.852 --> 00:57:47.511
Winning one's battle...

00:57:48.152 --> 00:57:50.709
with the enemy's respect

00:57:57.784 --> 00:57:58.807
Stock Exchange's closed

00:57:58.984 --> 00:57:59.711
And?

00:58:00.617 --> 00:58:03.673
Our stock dropped 20%

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:04.975
Closed at $6.50

00:58:08.283 --> 00:58:09.510
Our drop in asset value?

00:58:10.682 --> 00:58:12.511
Over 2 billion

00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:14.947
It's Chan,

00:58:15.115 --> 00:58:16.240
he's dumping our shares

00:58:18.448 --> 00:58:20.310
What's the news on him?

00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:23.442
Rumors are he wants...

00:58:23.648 --> 00:58:24.943
to buy our company

00:58:25.947 --> 00:58:27.572
Then...

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.807
why dump his shares?

00:58:31.079 --> 00:58:34.636
After buying them so high?

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:39.541
What's he up to?

00:58:40.245 --> 00:58:41.040
Boss

00:58:46.378 --> 00:58:47.275
What happened to you?

00:58:47.645 --> 00:58:49.167
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

00:58:49.478 --> 00:58:50.307
Was he hurt?

00:58:50.944 --> 00:58:52.341
Not a scratch

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:53.940
Thank God

00:58:54.377 --> 00:58:55.138
Else...

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:56.503
I'd blame myself

00:58:56.943 --> 00:58:57.966
And if...

00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:00.506
Well,

00:59:00.676 --> 00:59:01.937
you actually were hurt

00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:04.965
And see, I feel guilty

00:59:05.142 --> 00:59:06.698
It was your dad's idea

00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:09.932
He screwed up

00:59:10.441 --> 00:59:12.066
Ordering an ambush

00:59:12.441 --> 00:59:13.963
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

00:59:14.507 --> 00:59:16.735
That's much faster

00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:19.232
Let's do it

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.435
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

00:59:24.773 --> 00:59:26.796
Challenge him openly

00:59:27.906 --> 00:59:29.167
Right

00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:33.862
Yes!

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:37.234
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

00:59:38.471 --> 00:59:39.596
Tougher

00:59:41.005 --> 00:59:42.766
Smaller

00:59:43.937 --> 00:59:44.766
And...

00:59:45.237 --> 00:59:46.634
Handsomer than Chan

00:59:47.037 --> 00:59:49.093
He'll be devastated

00:59:57.602 --> 00:59:58.192
What's that?

00:59:59.269 --> 01:00:03.667
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.129
Tricky signals

01:00:14.734 --> 01:00:16.495
Have you seen her?

01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:19.731
That's Mary

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.990
No, that's Bunny

01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:23.357
No, that's Mary

01:00:23.533 --> 01:00:25.930
That's Bunny, come with me

01:00:26.132 --> 01:00:29.063
No, that way

01:00:29.431 --> 01:00:31.021
No

01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:33.322
Another Bunny?

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:35.859
A masseuse

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:37.720
A masseuse?

01:00:37.997 --> 01:00:38.963
Why not?

01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:02.025
Oh my God, what's he doing?

01:01:21.491 --> 01:01:22.787
Albert!

01:01:25.691 --> 01:01:27.384
Do I look pretty?

01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:28.886
Yes

01:01:31.257 --> 01:01:32.019
What?

01:01:32.891 --> 01:01:34.322
Your outfit

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.579
My Sunday best

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:39.779
Go to...

01:01:39.956 --> 01:01:41.148
Jean-Paul's Boutique

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:42.618
I'll call him,

01:01:42.855 --> 01:01:44.014
let him dress you

01:01:45.455 --> 01:01:46.921
You feed, shelter,

01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:48.918
and clothe me

01:01:49.088 --> 01:01:49.985
You're my guardian angel

01:01:51.054 --> 01:01:52.111
Your wish is...

01:01:52.421 --> 01:01:54.477
my command

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:55.344
Bye

01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:57.884
What?

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.352
How should I behave at dinner?

01:02:01.486 --> 01:02:03.543
You're playing a gangster's lady

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.083
Use method acting

01:02:09.186 --> 01:02:10.242
Teach me

01:02:10.552 --> 01:02:11.449
Just act snooty

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:14.008
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

01:02:15.751 --> 01:02:17.774
I'm an angel

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.443
She forgot something?

01:02:24.516 --> 01:02:25.504
Yes?

01:02:27.249 --> 01:02:28.044
Help!

01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:28.977
It's you!

01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:36.047
Where's Bu?

01:02:41.514 --> 01:02:45.139
Please tell me where she is

01:02:57.246 --> 01:02:57.836
Mr. Chan

01:02:58.046 --> 01:02:58.534
Thanks

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:03.877
Mr. Chan

01:03:23.142 --> 01:03:23.767
What's this?

01:03:24.576 --> 01:03:25.473
Excuse me

01:03:25.875 --> 01:03:27.670
The lady's so lovely

01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:30.397
She deserves some wind effect

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.436
You look gorgeous

01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:34.435
I know

01:03:45.339 --> 01:03:46.134
Well?

01:03:47.373 --> 01:03:49.430
A vintage wine, from '82

01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:58.494
But I can also tell

01:04:00.072 --> 01:04:02.469
The grape-picker was born in '60

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:06.065
Let's order

01:04:10.403 --> 01:04:11.334
You order

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:15.336
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

01:04:18.135 --> 01:04:19.431
Just kidding

01:04:19.935 --> 01:04:20.764
Thank God!

01:04:25.568 --> 01:04:28.193
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.696
We don't want to be crowded

01:04:38.866 --> 01:04:39.763
Excuse me

01:04:41.933 --> 01:04:43.592
You booked the whole place?

01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:46.522
Just you and me

01:04:47.732 --> 01:04:49.254
I was hoping

01:04:49.498 --> 01:04:51.794
To run into celebrities

01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:54.219
You must really...

01:04:54.398 --> 01:04:55.954
hate crowds

01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:57.391
What about your friends?

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:03.827
Here comes one

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.752
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

01:05:10.562 --> 01:05:13.790
Why'd you do it?

01:05:14.262 --> 01:05:16.989
Dump my company's shares?

01:05:17.195 --> 01:05:17.956
I'm at dinner,

01:05:18.128 --> 01:05:19.116
call me tomorrow

01:05:21.695 --> 01:05:24.354
You're hurting me

01:05:24.628 --> 01:05:26.389
And yourself too

01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:29.559
Mr. Lo, please leave

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:30.889
Sir

01:05:31.493 --> 01:05:32.822
You look intelligent

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.584
I am intelligent

01:05:35.126 --> 01:05:37.024
Then stay home and think

01:05:37.192 --> 01:05:38.715
Devise a way...

01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:40.721
to save your company

01:05:42.425 --> 01:05:43.914
Who are you?

01:05:44.391 --> 01:05:45.448
C.N.'s friend

01:05:45.758 --> 01:05:47.724
He booked the whole place for me

01:05:48.358 --> 01:05:50.324
You're disturbing us

01:05:50.757 --> 01:05:52.950
That's so rude

01:05:56.756 --> 01:05:58.517
Let's talk outside

01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:00.686
We've talked enough

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:03.485
See you outside

01:06:07.455 --> 01:06:10.852
That signal means "Follow me"

01:06:11.422 --> 01:06:12.410
Wrong again?

01:06:17.721 --> 01:06:18.845
You're snooty

01:06:19.654 --> 01:06:21.482
So are my friends

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.016
it rubs off

01:06:26.586 --> 01:06:27.574
You have to go?

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.875
It'll just take a minute

01:06:42.551 --> 01:06:43.346
C.N.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:46.775
Watch your back

01:06:57.082 --> 01:06:58.309
Watch your back

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:00.539
I called,

01:07:00.915 --> 01:07:03.608
cleared it with your boss

01:07:04.015 --> 01:07:05.480
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:08.409
Close the parking lot for us

01:07:09.148 --> 01:07:11.739
Relax, I'm footing the bill

01:07:11.981 --> 01:07:12.571
Fine, Mr. Lo

01:07:13.013 --> 01:07:14.445
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

01:07:17.147 --> 01:07:18.806
Have fun, Mr. Chan

01:07:20.713 --> 01:07:21.303
LW

01:07:22.179 --> 01:07:23.042
What's up?

01:07:23.513 --> 01:07:25.206
I want you to meet someone

01:07:25.578 --> 01:07:27.237
I hired him from overseas

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:29.342
Ladies and gentlemen

01:07:31.178 --> 01:07:32.041
Alan

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.065
An undefeated light-weight champion

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:45.874
He'll fight you one-on-one

01:07:47.676 --> 01:07:48.937
But...

01:07:49.143 --> 01:07:50.506
I'm a middle-weight

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:52.199
Too much of an edge

01:07:52.442 --> 01:07:55.669
But if you lose

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:59.269
Think of the disgrace

01:08:01.007 --> 01:08:03.564
Grow up

01:08:03.807 --> 01:08:04.830
Nuts

01:08:05.907 --> 01:08:06.736
Play this music for me

01:08:06.907 --> 01:08:07.804
No problem

01:08:59.933 --> 01:09:01.364
You have no choice

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:04.989
Why the gloves?

01:09:05.299 --> 01:09:07.356
This is a boxing match

01:09:07.599 --> 01:09:08.565
I'm not...

01:09:08.766 --> 01:09:09.424
into crippling people

01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:11.623
With gloves, it won't hurt?

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:14.094
Sure it'll hurt

01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:15.958
But much less

01:09:20.398 --> 01:09:21.489
All set

01:09:22.264 --> 01:09:22.922
Watch your head

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:25.989
Music

01:09:26.764 --> 01:09:28.229
Knock me down anyway you can

01:09:29.397 --> 01:09:30.953
But no dirty tricks

01:09:34.162 --> 01:09:36.821
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

01:09:39.828 --> 01:09:43.590
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

01:09:49.128 --> 01:09:50.094
You ask for it

01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:52.349
Are you ready?

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:53.151
Of course

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:57.720
Alan's losing big time

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.457
No, Alan's just testing him

01:10:00.759 --> 01:10:02.248
He's wearing Chan down

01:10:17.224 --> 01:10:20.519
Wait Good

01:10:29.188 --> 01:10:30.347
Changing gloves, why?

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:31.887
Even the odds

01:10:32.322 --> 01:10:33.719
Bigger the glove,

01:10:33.955 --> 01:10:35.182
bigger the handicap

01:10:35.588 --> 01:10:38.179
Chan's punches are soft

01:10:44.021 --> 01:10:45.247
I've come a long way,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.042
I don't want a short game

01:10:50.552 --> 01:10:51.518
Every boxer trains...

01:10:51.853 --> 01:10:52.876
to his own music

01:10:53.053 --> 01:10:53.916
When he fights,

01:10:54.119 --> 01:10:55.779
it give him rhythm

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:57.811
And rhythm paces his steps

01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:03.710
Chan has no rhythm

01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:06.183
He's controlled by Alan

01:11:07.417 --> 01:11:08.314
You're an expert

01:11:08.484 --> 01:11:09.041
You should be fighting

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:10.074
Right

01:11:10.584 --> 01:11:12.311
C.N. And I used to box

01:11:12.517 --> 01:11:13.812
But I always lost

01:11:14.317 --> 01:11:15.509
So I quit and became a...

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:16.741
Commentator

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:17.574
Wow!

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:19.281
You like that better?

01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:22.474
Sure. I sound so invincible

01:11:22.715 --> 01:11:24.113
But I'm just like you guys

01:11:24.615 --> 01:11:26.205
Helpless

01:11:33.948 --> 01:11:36.140
Chan used to have brilliant moves

01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:37.210
Now he's a mess

01:11:38.513 --> 01:11:41.308
Buying companies...

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.241
instead of training

01:11:42.413 --> 01:11:44.402
Loser!

01:12:13.342 --> 01:12:16.570
Chan's nervous, it's over

01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:24.592
Good hit, but not enough power

01:13:43.031 --> 01:13:43.928
Come on

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:25.313
You okay?

01:14:26.959 --> 01:14:27.925
You win

01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:32.849
We won

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:35.555
Let's kick him while he's down

01:14:35.858 --> 01:14:36.982
Good idea

01:14:40.857 --> 01:14:42.050
Don't be...

01:14:42.657 --> 01:14:44.486
such cowards

01:14:45.256 --> 01:14:46.619
Ganging up on a downed man

01:14:46.789 --> 01:14:48.721
There's no honor in that

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.916
You're good

01:14:57.888 --> 01:14:58.512
Get the car

01:15:04.921 --> 01:15:07.216
My joy is done. He's good

01:15:13.053 --> 01:15:15.814
C.N., you okay?

01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:19.945
You must be delighted

01:15:21.452 --> 01:15:24.384
No, but I thought I would be

01:15:28.651 --> 01:15:30.083
You need help?

01:15:34.117 --> 01:15:34.912
Damn it

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:42.671
C.N., call me

01:16:17.545 --> 01:16:18.272
You didn't leave?

01:16:18.778 --> 01:16:20.243
You asked me to wait

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.407
I came to find you

01:16:25.777 --> 01:16:28.265
Did they gang up on you?

01:16:28.577 --> 01:16:31.633
No, one-on-one, I lost

01:16:33.043 --> 01:16:36.304
You'll get used to it

01:16:38.109 --> 01:16:39.166
Just kidding

01:16:39.976 --> 01:16:43.339
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:48.105
I'll train, but not for them

01:16:48.874 --> 01:16:50.567
For what then?

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.463
A strong body, a quick mind

01:16:56.873 --> 01:16:58.600
I haven't trained in ages

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.103
Your huge gym, what a waste

01:17:04.973 --> 01:17:06.268
I hate training alone

01:17:08.972 --> 01:17:10.961
I'll join you

01:17:13.705 --> 01:17:14.693
Why be so nice to me?

01:17:15.937 --> 01:17:17.062
You're rich

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:21.126
You're cute when you smile

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.635
You looked grouchy just now

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.727
That's why you lost

01:17:28.536 --> 01:17:29.900
Stick with smiling

01:17:31.369 --> 01:17:33.926
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

01:17:38.234 --> 01:17:39.700
Take tomorrow off

01:17:39.968 --> 01:17:40.626
Why?

01:17:41.034 --> 01:17:42.261
Say yes first

01:17:42.467 --> 01:17:42.865
Why?

01:17:43.234 --> 01:17:44.358
Say yes first

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.491
Yes, now why?

01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:48.627
Play!

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.198
Memories are so many

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.424
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:03.363
I sketch a hazy future

01:18:04.298 --> 01:18:08.696
Knowing this illusion is love

01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:13.360
The tides of a lifetime

01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:18.591
Widen the shores slowly

01:18:19.029 --> 01:18:23.518
Quietly you and I meet

01:18:24.029 --> 01:18:29.120
Our love proves life is ever changing

01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:35.421
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:18:35.595 --> 01:18:40.390
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.390
Like eternity

01:18:44.393 --> 01:18:48.983
Is the night really still young?

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:55.585
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

01:18:55.758 --> 01:19:00.587
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

01:19:00.757 --> 01:19:04.553
I can think no more

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:06.919
But this love

01:19:07.623 --> 01:19:11.919
Links the sea with the sky

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:39.948
My eyes have been raining

01:19:40.686 --> 01:19:45.015
I can't hold on with both hands

01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:49.813
I cry as we seek happiness

01:19:50.251 --> 01:19:55.411
You're just like a shooting star

01:19:55.750 --> 01:20:00.148
Those happy moments

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:05.443
Lock you between my brows

01:20:05.816 --> 01:20:10.145
No matter how the world dazzles

01:20:10.748 --> 01:20:15.908
It pales next to your eternal splendor

01:20:16.748 --> 01:20:22.270
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:20:22.447 --> 01:20:27.038
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:20:27.213 --> 01:20:30.269
Like eternity

01:20:31.379 --> 01:20:35.970
Is the night really still young?

01:20:36.612 --> 01:20:37.407
You love me?

01:20:40.045 --> 01:20:40.976
I think you're quite...

01:20:41.145 --> 01:20:43.508
Answer the question

01:20:44.711 --> 01:20:45.472
The fact is...

01:20:45.644 --> 01:20:47.576
C'mon

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:51.368
Answer in 4 words or less

01:20:51.877 --> 01:20:54.968
I love you

01:20:56.109 --> 01:20:58.734
Or I don't

01:21:20.138 --> 01:21:22.366
When did you slip in?

01:21:22.604 --> 01:21:26.730
I'm in love

01:21:26.904 --> 01:21:32.302
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

01:21:32.836 --> 01:21:37.893
So don't get fooled by love

01:21:39.735 --> 01:21:42.826
You're such an optimist

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:46.863
I have news for you

01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:48.195
What?

01:21:48.434 --> 01:21:49.661
Longyi's here

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:53.996
He almost strangled me

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:56.491
But I calmed him down

01:21:56.967 --> 01:21:58.523
He's been drunk ever since

01:21:59.866 --> 01:22:01.526
My fault

01:22:01.799 --> 01:22:05.561
No way

01:22:05.799 --> 01:22:08.730
Listen, love is not sympathy

01:22:09.098 --> 01:22:11.155
You're tangled up...

01:22:11.332 --> 01:22:12.319
with Chan

01:22:12.498 --> 01:22:13.486
Don't let Longyi see you

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:20.928
Wine please No

01:22:21.097 --> 01:22:22.323
Wait

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:23.493
Let go

01:22:23.963 --> 01:22:24.622
No

01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:25.820
Kitchen time

01:22:25.996 --> 01:22:26.552
Kitchen

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:29.852
I need...

01:22:34.495 --> 01:22:35.325
What?

01:22:35.895 --> 01:22:36.758
I...

01:22:37.129 --> 01:22:39.219
I need a glass

01:22:39.394 --> 01:22:40.791
I'll get it

01:22:42.594 --> 01:22:43.253
Go inside

01:22:44.927 --> 01:22:46.051
No pushing

01:22:48.926 --> 01:22:51.222
Albert

01:22:53.893 --> 01:22:55.222
Where's the opener?

01:22:58.625 --> 01:22:59.454
Albert

01:23:01.258 --> 01:23:02.189
Smooth move

01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:04.984
So cold!

01:23:05.158 --> 01:23:06.055
Albert

01:23:08.324 --> 01:23:09.381
Now what?

01:23:10.257 --> 01:23:13.620
I need the opener

01:23:17.057 --> 01:23:18.613
Where is it?

01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:20.217
Hurry!

01:23:25.856 --> 01:23:26.753
What's that?

01:23:28.621 --> 01:23:31.087
The family above us

01:23:31.255 --> 01:23:32.743
Has a brat

01:23:33.954 --> 01:23:35.420
It's from above us?

01:23:36.588 --> 01:23:38.951
Where else?

01:23:53.219 --> 01:23:54.650
It's from above us

01:23:55.418 --> 01:23:58.009
It's that brat again

01:23:59.084 --> 01:24:00.311
Opener

01:24:00.917 --> 01:24:01.712
Forget it

01:24:03.984 --> 01:24:05.915
Drink it this way

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:08.543
Wait Come

01:24:10.083 --> 01:24:10.548
Drink with me

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:14.374
You okay?

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:18.079
I must tell C.N.

01:24:18.249 --> 01:24:19.475
A game...

01:24:19.648 --> 01:24:20.807
is fun

01:24:20.982 --> 01:24:23.243
Till its secret is revealed

01:24:23.648 --> 01:24:27.340
I know he loves me

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.812
He skips work to be with me

01:24:32.147 --> 01:24:35.170
I miss him day and night

01:24:35.813 --> 01:24:38.108
I'm like a child again

01:24:38.346 --> 01:24:41.278
Getting so attached to him

01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:43.773
I see something beautiful

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.805
I want it for him

01:24:46.245 --> 01:24:49.642
Something happens, I want to tell him

01:24:50.078 --> 01:24:53.339
I'm so happy

01:24:53.877 --> 01:24:54.639
And...

01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:55.637
so cold!

01:24:56.377 --> 01:24:57.933
You're in love

01:25:01.176 --> 01:25:01.835
Need something?

01:25:02.443 --> 01:25:03.703
Sake

01:25:04.043 --> 01:25:05.168
Finish your wine first

01:25:05.343 --> 01:25:06.933
I want sake

01:25:07.275 --> 01:25:09.468
Just wait outside Sake

01:25:10.842 --> 01:25:12.035
Hang on

01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:16.970
Excuse me

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.171
Let's sing

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:29.429
This is not a Karaoke bar

01:25:30.439 --> 01:25:31.735
We don't have time

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.962
We'll split this

01:25:33.139 --> 01:25:33.696
Too much

01:25:33.972 --> 01:25:35.370
Not at all

01:25:35.638 --> 01:25:36.899
Enough

01:25:38.538 --> 01:25:39.765
Cheers

01:25:41.871 --> 01:25:44.337
You'll get drunk

01:25:46.504 --> 01:25:48.527
Drink it

01:25:53.237 --> 01:25:54.497
1... 2... 3...

01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.601
Down!

01:26:07.268 --> 01:26:08.460
Still kicking. Thank God

01:26:29.399 --> 01:26:31.126
She's safe here

01:26:36.431 --> 01:26:37.692
Here she is

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:51.818
Gloria, Bu

01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:53.253
Gloria's a good friend

01:26:54.563 --> 01:26:56.391
She's the one impersonating me?

01:26:56.862 --> 01:26:57.259
Yes!

01:26:57.428 --> 01:26:58.325
Not bad

01:27:03.395 --> 01:27:05.417
You knew all along

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.319
Why con me?

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.885
You started it

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:17.017
All the love I felt between us

01:27:17.193 --> 01:27:21.818
That was just an act?

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:24.614
Our happiness was no act

01:27:25.459 --> 01:27:26.447
If you like,

01:27:27.258 --> 01:27:28.655
stay in Hong Kong

01:27:30.257 --> 01:27:31.621
What am I?

01:27:33.191 --> 01:27:34.884
One of your women?

01:27:39.824 --> 01:27:42.381
The bottle sent me to you

01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:46.619
A fairy tale becomes...

01:27:48.422 --> 01:27:50.081
a nightmare

01:28:07.453 --> 01:28:08.680
My big mouth

01:28:09.486 --> 01:28:10.543
No

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.407
Get her back

01:28:12.718 --> 01:28:13.241
No

01:28:18.019 --> 01:28:20.143
Weren't we on the same plane?

01:28:22.051 --> 01:28:22.948
Back to Taiwan?

01:28:23.218 --> 01:28:23.706
Yes

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:25.273
You had fun?

01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:26.878
It was okay

01:28:27.717 --> 01:28:29.080
I bought a lot,

01:28:29.317 --> 01:28:30.283
what about you?

01:28:32.316 --> 01:28:33.509
I...

01:28:33.917 --> 01:28:35.212
I bought a story

01:28:35.616 --> 01:28:36.911
A story!

01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:38.445
Is it in an office building?

01:28:52.381 --> 01:28:53.176
The government passed a law...

01:28:53.347 --> 01:28:54.937
prohibiting the use...

01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:56.572
of non-bio-degradable

01:28:56.747 --> 01:28:58.679
styrofoam

01:28:59.046 --> 01:28:59.740
LW's stock...

01:28:59.913 --> 01:29:02.970
dropped drastically

01:29:03.479 --> 01:29:05.877
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

01:29:06.245 --> 01:29:07.767
Major stockholders,

01:29:07.945 --> 01:29:09.206
are dumping them

01:29:09.512 --> 01:29:10.136
You knew...

01:29:10.312 --> 01:29:12.209
the law would be passed?

01:29:13.545 --> 01:29:15.306
It was only a matter of time

01:29:15.478 --> 01:29:17.307
Should we borrow money?

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:18.773
Up to you guys

01:29:19.211 --> 01:29:19.835
Mr. Chan,

01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:22.408
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:24.573
Just to...

01:29:24.743 --> 01:29:25.674
get even

01:29:25.976 --> 01:29:27.237
I won't

01:29:28.543 --> 01:29:29.668
That's all for today

01:29:29.843 --> 01:29:30.399
The acquisition...

01:29:30.576 --> 01:29:32.565
is a go?

01:29:32.875 --> 01:29:33.533
I'll let you know

01:30:49.298 --> 01:30:58.821
Love is like falling maples

01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:01.255
Like what?

01:31:02.463 --> 01:31:07.327
Like falling maples

01:31:07.496 --> 01:31:09.086
What does that mean?

01:31:09.929 --> 01:31:10.758
I don't know

01:31:13.095 --> 01:31:15.617
I've never seen you like this

01:31:15.795 --> 01:31:17.352
Paper everywhere

01:31:18.095 --> 01:31:19.560
Just do...

01:31:19.728 --> 01:31:21.626
what you have to do

01:31:22.328 --> 01:31:22.986
Again?

01:31:23.528 --> 01:31:24.652
Forget it

01:31:25.961 --> 01:31:26.517
What?

01:31:26.961 --> 01:31:28.256
Nothing

01:31:28.493 --> 01:31:29.981
Leave me alone

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:36.483
Fine, be that way

01:31:39.192 --> 01:31:40.919
You broke it?

01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:41.950
Good guess

01:31:43.358 --> 01:31:43.847
Sir

01:31:44.024 --> 01:31:44.820
Call 911

01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:46.112
They'll stop me

01:31:46.458 --> 01:31:47.116
Just call

01:31:56.723 --> 01:31:58.416
See

01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.385
What do you want?

01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.914
You ruined our boss,

01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:02.120
lost us our jobs

01:32:02.922 --> 01:32:04.411
We came for payback

01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:08.148
Mr. Chan

01:32:10.288 --> 01:32:11.844
I heard you're back in training

01:32:12.088 --> 01:32:12.644
Yes, I am

01:32:13.088 --> 01:32:13.815
Rematch?

01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:15.344
Mr. Lo sent you?

01:32:15.588 --> 01:32:16.554
Mr. Lo is broke

01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:18.582
It's not about money

01:32:20.354 --> 01:32:21.785
Not now

01:32:22.753 --> 01:32:23.878
You got no choice

01:32:27.819 --> 01:32:29.910
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:32.783
Only with the best

01:32:39.618 --> 01:32:42.708
What are they talking about?

01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:44.648
You never learned English...

01:32:44.817 --> 01:32:45.612
in school?

01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:46.714
C'mon, tell me

01:32:47.784 --> 01:32:48.306
No

01:32:52.482 --> 01:32:53.379
Okay

01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:00.210
Rules?

01:33:00.381 --> 01:33:01.278
No rules

01:33:03.515 --> 01:33:07.140
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

01:33:15.713 --> 01:33:16.940
You like white

01:33:27.378 --> 01:33:28.207
Are you sure?

01:33:29.911 --> 01:33:30.774
I'm sure

01:34:52.968 --> 01:34:53.797
Good training

01:35:48.928 --> 01:35:49.984
Wait

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:12.712
Now what?

01:36:14.157 --> 01:36:16.146
"What's you okay?" In English?

01:36:16.623 --> 01:36:17.816
Are you okay?

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:19.485
Are you okay?

01:36:21.889 --> 01:36:22.820
Okay

01:36:41.321 --> 01:36:42.116
Pretty good

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:45.415
I'm coming

01:37:51.145 --> 01:37:51.838
Ready?

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:22.768
Come on

01:38:26.307 --> 01:38:28.739
Smile, don't worry

01:39:06.536 --> 01:39:07.433
Are you ready?

01:39:25.866 --> 01:39:27.764
Come on

01:40:32.125 --> 01:40:33.954
Don't worry, be happy

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.649
Let's dance

01:41:33.284 --> 01:41:33.977
Let's finish

01:42:55.173 --> 01:42:56.298
Get up

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:57.437
On your feet

01:43:04.072 --> 01:43:05.060
You okay?

01:43:16.338 --> 01:43:17.099
Yes

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:19.800
You won

01:43:20.137 --> 01:43:20.728
I lost

01:43:21.437 --> 01:43:21.993
Why?

01:43:22.836 --> 01:43:23.563
Pound for pound

01:43:23.736 --> 01:43:26.202
He'd have beaten me in no time

01:43:27.336 --> 01:43:28.427
See if he's all right

01:43:31.868 --> 01:43:32.925
You smell turpentine?

01:43:33.302 --> 01:43:34.733
The boss is setting a fire

01:43:36.802 --> 01:43:38.028
Fantastic

01:43:38.834 --> 01:43:39.857
But we'll go to jail

01:43:40.034 --> 01:43:40.931
Prison!

01:43:42.034 --> 01:43:43.522
This is nuts

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:44.966
Watch it

01:43:45.833 --> 01:43:47.026
No sweat

01:43:47.733 --> 01:43:49.824
Hey, jail sucks, boss

01:43:51.633 --> 01:43:56.462
You checked there's nobody inside?

01:43:56.699 --> 01:43:57.824
Sure did

01:43:57.999 --> 01:43:59.056
Good

01:43:59.598 --> 01:44:02.393
Give this to dad

01:44:02.831 --> 01:44:04.694
Tell him I love him

01:44:05.631 --> 01:44:07.426
Give this to C.N.

01:44:07.664 --> 01:44:10.596
Tell him I hate him

01:44:11.230 --> 01:44:13.457
This is for the cops

01:44:13.964 --> 01:44:16.293
I'm claiming all responsibility

01:44:16.596 --> 01:44:18.528
Really?

01:44:18.696 --> 01:44:19.787
You're going to jail, not us?

01:44:23.929 --> 01:44:25.019
Me neither

01:44:26.895 --> 01:44:28.225
Stand aside

01:44:30.095 --> 01:44:31.822
C.N. And I go down together

01:44:31.994 --> 01:44:33.620
Don't do it, boss

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.450
My eyes hurt

01:44:37.493 --> 01:44:39.220
But so what?

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.787
I'm going to die anyway

01:44:42.226 --> 01:44:44.555
Bye, Mary

01:44:48.326 --> 01:44:49.848
Calm down, LW

01:44:50.492 --> 01:44:53.946
It's all your fault

01:44:54.191 --> 01:44:55.248
You took it too far

01:44:55.625 --> 01:44:57.022
Dad kicked me off the Board

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:59.281
I have nothing now

01:44:59.457 --> 01:45:00.582
I'm finished

01:45:01.657 --> 01:45:03.748
What about us, boss?

01:45:03.957 --> 01:45:05.150
Are we finished too?

01:45:05.656 --> 01:45:06.145
You're asking me?

01:45:06.324 --> 01:45:07.381
Yes

01:45:08.190 --> 01:45:09.212
Shut up

01:45:11.656 --> 01:45:12.951
Boss

01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:15.450
Okay now?

01:45:15.622 --> 01:45:16.451
Warmer still

01:45:17.655 --> 01:45:18.211
How's that?

01:45:18.522 --> 01:45:19.317
Just right

01:45:21.092 --> 01:45:21.989
Your eyes still hurt?

01:45:24.459 --> 01:45:25.550
Why be so nice to me?

01:45:25.892 --> 01:45:26.721
You wanted to ruin me

01:45:28.559 --> 01:45:29.217
Styrofoam's bad...

01:45:29.392 --> 01:45:31.414
for the environment

01:45:32.058 --> 01:45:33.853
It needs to be regulated

01:45:34.059 --> 01:45:36.819
That motivated my acquisition

01:45:37.224 --> 01:45:38.519
Let's be partners

01:45:38.824 --> 01:45:41.756
In recycling paper

01:45:43.257 --> 01:45:44.745
That's not like you

01:45:45.491 --> 01:45:46.922
Ever since grade school

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:48.517
You've had to beat me

01:45:49.156 --> 01:45:50.850
In whatever we do

01:45:51.056 --> 01:45:53.113
You stole my girlfriends

01:45:53.656 --> 01:45:56.554
And then dumped them

01:45:56.723 --> 01:45:57.711
Never really loved them

01:45:58.423 --> 01:45:59.286
I hated you so

01:46:00.289 --> 01:46:01.516
I hated you too

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:03.578
Really? What for?

01:46:03.655 --> 01:46:04.643
For always laughing

01:46:05.255 --> 01:46:06.914
For being born so rich

01:46:07.988 --> 01:46:09.079
For your name

01:46:09.555 --> 01:46:11.645
Low Wow is a stupid name

01:46:13.122 --> 01:46:14.451
I hated you most

01:46:14.722 --> 01:46:16.914
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

01:46:18.235 --> 01:46:20.030
So it boils down to Ann

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.459
But she dumped me

01:46:26.967 --> 01:46:28.865
She married that...

01:46:29.034 --> 01:46:32.363
Andy Law Andy Law

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.583
That nerd

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.551
So dull

01:46:40.819 --> 01:46:42.046
We fought for so many years

01:46:43.053 --> 01:46:45.109
But we each haven't committed

01:46:45.752 --> 01:46:47.513
To loving only one woman

01:46:47.918 --> 01:46:50.713
But what about Mary?

01:46:50.885 --> 01:46:51.942
She's nothing

01:46:52.384 --> 01:46:53.441
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

01:46:54.284 --> 01:46:55.772
Weren't you engaged?

01:46:55.851 --> 01:46:56.874
What happened?

01:46:59.051 --> 01:47:01.107
I copped out

01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:05.740
but she's one great dame

01:47:06.173 --> 01:47:10.036
We were so happy together

01:47:10.716 --> 01:47:13.681
Laughing all day long

01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:18.205
Wish I could turn the clock back

01:47:20.614 --> 01:47:23.546
But she moved overseas

01:47:24.914 --> 01:47:26.504
I lost track of her

01:47:29.247 --> 01:47:31.405
What's wrong?

01:47:34.113 --> 01:47:34.942
See you later

01:47:36.246 --> 01:47:39.643
Did I say something?

01:47:44.379 --> 01:47:45.174
Skipper

01:47:46.046 --> 01:47:46.943
Your Bu is back

01:47:47.312 --> 01:47:51.574
Yes, she is. Cheers

01:47:51.945 --> 01:47:55.536
Skipper, cheers

01:48:07.909 --> 01:48:08.738
What's that?

01:48:10.576 --> 01:48:11.633
Going to college?

01:48:12.975 --> 01:48:14.168
Considering it

01:48:17.409 --> 01:48:18.567
You've changed

01:48:20.141 --> 01:48:22.573
Love changes people

01:48:25.941 --> 01:48:27.304
Don't rush...

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.269
to forget him

01:48:31.673 --> 01:48:34.003
Or it'll get worse

01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.062
One day

01:48:36.673 --> 01:48:38.036
You take a shower

01:48:38.206 --> 01:48:38.864
Listen to music

01:48:39.606 --> 01:48:41.503
And suddenly remember him

01:48:42.505 --> 01:48:45.266
Then you've forgotten him

01:48:50.138 --> 01:48:52.069
You're pretty when you smile

01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:56.765
Bu

01:49:00.803 --> 01:49:01.530
Albert

01:49:01.703 --> 01:49:03.032
Where have you been?

01:49:03.602 --> 01:49:05.465
I was so worried

01:49:10.368 --> 01:49:11.527
You're not...

01:49:11.901 --> 01:49:13.299
really my type

01:49:16.835 --> 01:49:19.062
I like older men

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:20.597
I'm older than you

01:49:22.834 --> 01:49:24.094
I mean here

01:49:25.099 --> 01:49:26.030
Here?

01:49:26.833 --> 01:49:28.458
If I were your girl

01:49:28.766 --> 01:49:30.595
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

01:49:34.465 --> 01:49:35.725
You'll get it

01:49:36.132 --> 01:49:36.893
I miss you so

01:49:37.299 --> 01:49:38.628
I was so worried about you

01:49:40.464 --> 01:49:42.191
This must be your mother

01:49:42.664 --> 01:49:43.323
This is...

01:49:43.697 --> 01:49:45.822
Albert, my pal

01:49:49.463 --> 01:49:52.553
Can you be my adopted brother?

01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:54.352
Good idea

01:49:54.696 --> 01:49:55.593
I'm the adopted mother?

01:49:56.696 --> 01:49:57.457
Wait

01:49:59.162 --> 01:50:00.593
Why not? Mom

01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.694
Son

01:50:02.195 --> 01:50:02.661
Mom

01:50:03.361 --> 01:50:05.350
My Albert

01:50:05.528 --> 01:50:05.959
Mom

01:50:38.057 --> 01:50:39.148
Bu! Bu!

01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:40.149
I missed you

01:50:42.123 --> 01:50:43.453
You miss me?

01:50:49.255 --> 01:50:50.186
Come back

01:50:51.055 --> 01:50:51.783
Bu!

01:50:54.655 --> 01:50:55.484
Bu!

01:51:27.051 --> 01:51:27.948
Bu!

01:51:30.551 --> 01:51:31.209
Scram

01:51:31.917 --> 01:51:34.008
It's you who bullied my daughter

01:51:34.184 --> 01:51:34.945
No, I didn't

01:51:35.284 --> 01:51:36.147
You did too

01:51:36.817 --> 01:51:39.839
She used to laugh all the time

01:51:40.216 --> 01:51:42.909
Now she hardly smiles

01:51:43.283 --> 01:51:46.180
My heart aches for her

01:51:46.749 --> 01:51:49.237
What did you do to her?

01:51:49.815 --> 01:51:51.338
Nothing

01:51:51.614 --> 01:51:53.341
Then why is she like this?

01:51:53.948 --> 01:51:55.675
Please let me talk to her

01:51:55.914 --> 01:51:57.607
Just...

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:00.837
leave her alone

01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.544
I don't speak Taiwanese

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.541
He said leave her alone

01:52:04.712 --> 01:52:05.643
Beat it

01:52:09.046 --> 01:52:09.602
Bu!

01:52:11.345 --> 01:52:12.208
Bu!

01:52:12.845 --> 01:52:13.334
Get lost

01:52:13.512 --> 01:52:14.000
Bu

01:52:14.245 --> 01:52:14.710
Hit the road

01:52:16.145 --> 01:52:16.667
I...

01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:33.571
It's all right

01:52:44.008 --> 01:52:45.598
You bullied my niece

01:53:03.572 --> 01:53:04.196
Sir

01:53:15.604 --> 01:53:17.069
I'll just sit here

01:53:17.603 --> 01:53:19.069
Don't walk past me

01:53:20.236 --> 01:53:22.498
You dad's a cool dude

01:53:26.836 --> 01:53:29.358
Sir, you okay?

01:53:30.335 --> 01:53:31.232
Are you hurt?

01:53:31.602 --> 01:53:33.760
Leave us alone

01:53:34.635 --> 01:53:35.965
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

01:53:36.134 --> 01:53:38.066
Waste of time

01:53:38.468 --> 01:53:39.728
Bu, I...

01:53:39.901 --> 01:53:41.060
Shut up

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.293
Bu!

01:53:45.567 --> 01:53:46.396
Shut up

01:53:47.799 --> 01:53:48.322
Bu!

01:53:48.632 --> 01:53:49.257
Shut up

01:53:50.666 --> 01:53:51.155
Bu!

01:53:53.032 --> 01:53:54.396
I'm warning you

01:53:55.065 --> 01:53:55.894
Either you kill me

01:53:56.865 --> 01:53:58.263
Or let me talk to her

01:54:02.598 --> 01:54:05.961
All right, come

01:54:07.464 --> 01:54:09.521
Speak up

01:54:11.896 --> 01:54:15.794
Now or never

01:54:16.162 --> 01:54:17.560
Don't disturb them

01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:18.956
I want to hear

01:54:26.095 --> 01:54:26.992
Why bother?

01:54:31.494 --> 01:54:33.050
You left these

01:54:35.394 --> 01:54:36.620
I have plenty

01:54:42.026 --> 01:54:43.924
I brought Chinese pot rice

01:54:45.592 --> 01:54:47.524
It's cold, but it's your favorite

01:54:51.325 --> 01:54:55.256
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

01:54:58.558 --> 01:55:00.114
There's more

01:55:09.789 --> 01:55:11.220
I put a note in each one

01:55:12.322 --> 01:55:13.379
Saying what?

01:55:14.456 --> 01:55:16.546
I love you, I miss you

01:55:17.155 --> 01:55:18.518
Never over 4 words

01:55:19.022 --> 01:55:20.351
took me hours

01:55:22.854 --> 01:55:24.286
Too much work

01:55:24.821 --> 01:55:26.480
Just put $1,000 in each

01:55:26.854 --> 01:55:27.979
And you have me

01:55:41.086 --> 01:55:43.415
So do you love me?

01:55:44.618 --> 01:55:45.379
I love you

01:55:47.185 --> 01:55:48.741
Since when?

01:55:49.718 --> 01:55:51.274
Since you stole my name-card

01:55:53.451 --> 01:55:55.212
What wish did you make...

01:55:55.384 --> 01:55:56.576
on the boat?

01:55:59.750 --> 01:56:00.738
It's already come true

01:56:04.716 --> 01:56:06.545
Why do you cry?

01:56:09.482 --> 01:56:10.448
Kiss her

01:56:11.449 --> 01:56:13.676
Kiss her

01:56:13.915 --> 01:56:15.847
I'll say it in Cantonese

01:56:16.581 --> 01:56:17.569
Kiss her

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:27.741
You're...

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.238
Xiaojun

01:56:29.612 --> 01:56:31.271
Do I know you?

01:56:32.079 --> 01:56:33.443
I'm your neighbor

01:56:33.912 --> 01:56:35.741
Wow, fantastic!

01:56:36.145 --> 01:56:36.701
Why?

01:56:37.845 --> 01:56:38.833
Oh, weather is fine

01:56:53.609 --> 01:56:54.597
Look at them

01:57:09.008 --> 01:57:10.598
The women here are gorgeous

01:57:10.808 --> 01:57:11.239
I should have...

01:57:11.407 --> 01:57:12.100
Go to hell

01:57:12.674 --> 01:57:15.162
I want you to meet my dolphin

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:16.129
Really?

01:57:16.406 --> 01:57:19.167
Bu! Bu!

01:57:19.406 --> 01:57:20.167
Wow!
