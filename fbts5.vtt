00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:09.942
100 years ago,

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.808
this island in Taiwan...

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:15.043
had nothing

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.010
Only romance

00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.344
Legend has it

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:24.370
There were two lovers

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:26.344
And one day

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:30.668
The man was fishing

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.111
His boat sank

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:35.207
The woman...

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.836
saw it onshore

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.009
She swam out

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:44.373
No one ever saw them again

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:45.904
Some say

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.108
they became dolphins

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:53.838
All dolphins around this island...

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.942
came from them

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:08.964
They all make...

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.799
"Bu... Bu" noises

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:27.531
Nice story?

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:34.566
So snooty

00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:39.025
You told a horror story

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:43.367
Don't get involved

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.902
Have some melon

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:48.463
No

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:49.492
You're like...

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.100
those dolphins

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.757
So picky

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.126
You named me Bu

00:02:55.535 --> 00:03:00.160
I've told you so often

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.796
Don't mix Mandarin...

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.126
with Cantonese

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.595
Bu's Mandarin and Cantonese...

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.823
are now both accented

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.823
You teach her Mandarin then

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.826
Get off my case

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:20.625
That's Cantonese again

00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:23.795
Which I don't speak

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:27.490
What did you say?

00:03:28.964 --> 00:03:30.225
Tell me

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:35.522
Skipper Restaurant

00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.224
Open bar, folks

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.549
One more round

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.985
Drink up

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:12.555
Go in and take a seat

00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:16.055
Long time no see

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:24.148
One more round?

00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:25.914
Not tonight

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.712
Can't afford it

00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:30.488
On the house

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.677
Bu, 6 beers, on me

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.314
They come everyday

00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:38.454
Never pay

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:40.050
Add water...

00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:41.449
to the beer

00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:44.552
That trick again?

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.377
Bu Yes?

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:47.951
Hurry

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:49.884
Here

00:04:50.054 --> 00:04:51.747
Did you add water?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.943
No!

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.946
No, very good

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:56.419
C'mon

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:00.109
Cheers

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:11.450
Why, Bu?

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.440
Idiot

00:05:14.717 --> 00:05:17.410
You could've spared me

00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:22.445
They sing

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.806
Watch TV

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:27.512
Or pick fights

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:29.844
This island

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:31.605
Has no room...

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:33.036
for romance

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:55.642
Done

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:57.476
Beautiful

00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:58.338
I learned it...

00:05:58.512 --> 00:05:59.909
from a magazine

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:06.808
Bu

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.236
I brought you something

00:06:13.476 --> 00:06:14.464
I've never seen...

00:06:15.243 --> 00:06:17.708
an oyster this big

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:20.499
Any pearls?

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:22.175
No

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:28.106
Must be expensive

00:06:28.508 --> 00:06:29.599
NT$3,000

00:06:33.074 --> 00:06:33.869
Thanks

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.404
And this

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.603
It's my friend's shop

00:06:39.906 --> 00:06:41.997
He'll give us a discount

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:43.865
I'm...

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.396
Proposing?

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.264
No, I just want to...

00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:50.699
Yes, I'm proposing

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:53.895
With...

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:55.900
a big oyster?

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.228
Of course not

00:06:57.404 --> 00:06:58.700
The oyster's not...

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.331
Marry me

00:07:03.837 --> 00:07:04.598
Okay

00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:08.362
I'll consider it

00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.193
Poor Longyi

00:07:24.434 --> 00:07:25.797
This oyster's not cheap

00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:29.626
He proposed to me

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:31.959
Really?

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:34.090
You love him?

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.995
Well, he's actually...

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:39.992
Not bad

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.160
Your answer

00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:43.729
Shouldn't be over 4 words

00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:45.488
You love him, or you don't

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:02.685
You left Hong Kong...

00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:04.123
to marry dad, why?

00:08:05.162 --> 00:08:06.650
He was quite a hunk

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:09.717
A good cook too

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:12.451
You're a good cook

00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:14.053
He's better

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:17.290
He cooks with love

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.022
What's loving someone like?

00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:30.586
You miss him

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:34.185
The sight of him thrills you

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.816
You ache

00:08:36.858 --> 00:08:38.324
When he's gone

00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:44.185
You could watch him forever

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.381
Even when he's sleeping

00:08:47.857 --> 00:08:49.379
You're in love

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.921
If you feel like that

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:53.618
Okay?

00:09:08.254 --> 00:09:09.776
You miss Hong Kong?

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:13.551
Yes, especially its Chinese Pot Rice

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:14.747
I see

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.947
You don't love Longyi

00:09:20.187 --> 00:09:21.709
Take mama's advice

00:09:22.352 --> 00:09:24.215
Trust your heart

00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:26.981
Do what you have to do

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:35.277
Bu

00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.805
Hey, kid

00:09:51.183 --> 00:09:52.978
Got some news

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:55.539
Longyi proposed

00:09:57.182 --> 00:09:58.408
Don't laugh

00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:04.244
Somebody said

00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:09.545
Men and women...

00:10:10.647 --> 00:10:11.907
exist in pairs

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:16.241
Till separated on earth

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:20.968
Then they go through life

00:10:22.212 --> 00:10:24.110
Searching for one another

00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:27.369
Bu

00:10:28.178 --> 00:10:29.541
Where are you going?

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.942
Bu!

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.962
I'm waiting for you!

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.436
Hong Kong, Albert?

00:11:06.206 --> 00:11:07.762
How romantic!

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:04.787
You're telling me something?

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:08.461
You choose for me

00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:06.148
You just decided my future

00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:12.216
Excuse me

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.083
You know a good cafe?

00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:17.955
Sure, we'll go together

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.279
Thanks

00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:30.049
Typical Taiwanese!

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:32.248
Pardon me?

00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:34.286
You speak Cantonese?

00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:35.384
Surprised?

00:13:46.186 --> 00:13:47.811
Never flown before?

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:48.780
It shows?

00:13:49.153 --> 00:13:50.413
Yes

00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:54.642
You can get lost in Hong Kong

00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:56.575
I'll show you around

00:13:57.051 --> 00:13:58.346
I know...

00:13:58.718 --> 00:13:59.876
all the trendy spots

00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:02.374
I have fans everywhere

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.016
I'm a fun guy

00:14:04.517 --> 00:14:05.380
Okay?

00:14:15.182 --> 00:14:16.011
What?

00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:17.573
Are you twins?

00:14:20.848 --> 00:14:21.779
Please forgive me

00:14:23.448 --> 00:14:24.777
Excuse me

00:14:27.014 --> 00:14:27.980
Gangster's girlfriend

00:14:28.148 --> 00:14:29.841
disappears

00:14:59.877 --> 00:15:02.240
Morning, sir, working out?

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:04.775
No time

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.938
Bill, are you ready?

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.469
Good

00:15:27.507 --> 00:15:29.631
Let's start

00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:34.594
Morning, Mr. Chan

00:15:35.072 --> 00:15:37.334
Any news from Wall Street?

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:38.368
Lion Fund...

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:41.402
is borrowing heavily

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:43.898
Even at...

00:15:44.071 --> 00:15:45.764
a 20% interbank rate

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.561
Check the following

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:53.230
How many Nikkei Futures...

00:15:53.403 --> 00:15:55.130
did they short?

00:15:55.369 --> 00:15:58.130
Is Yen...

00:15:58.302 --> 00:15:59.927
appreciating?

00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.100
Is the lease for the US base...

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:04.393
in Japan expiring?

00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:07.261
If both answer are affirmative

00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:08.898
Buy whatever they sell

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.395
But this hedge fund

00:16:10.567 --> 00:16:12.692
Is run by 2 Nobel Prize economists

00:16:12.868 --> 00:16:15.390
Should be invincible

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.957
They're too greedy

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.925
on margin trading

00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:21.062
Leveraging 10 times their worth

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:22.324
They're doomed

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.822
So go ahead

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:24.965
Yes, Mr. Chan

00:16:25.233 --> 00:16:25.891
Thank you

00:16:33.664 --> 00:16:35.289
Send this with 100 roses...

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:37.054
to Carman

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.020
During office hours

00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:41.562
Didn't you break up?

00:16:42.497 --> 00:16:43.428
We're still friends

00:16:46.396 --> 00:16:48.521
Find someone and

00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:51.560
settle down

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:52.757
Like who?

00:16:53.895 --> 00:16:55.384
Those women around you

00:16:56.795 --> 00:16:59.955
All so beautiful and elegant

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:02.016
Too elegant for me

00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.654
What do you want?

00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:07.052
Someone amusing

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:11.651
Make yourself at home

00:18:15.018 --> 00:18:17.609
That bottle floated to Taiwan!

00:18:20.384 --> 00:18:21.611
And you came...

00:18:22.284 --> 00:18:23.749
all that way

00:18:24.784 --> 00:18:26.773
How brave and romantic

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:33.174
However...

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:34.806
What?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.447
I...

00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:39.480
What?

00:18:46.415 --> 00:18:47.971
I'm gay

00:18:52.414 --> 00:18:53.607
No

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.941
Yes

00:18:55.114 --> 00:18:55.841
Really?

00:18:56.214 --> 00:18:57.009
Really

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.139
No

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.102
Yes

00:18:59.279 --> 00:18:59.802
Honest?

00:18:59.979 --> 00:19:00.570
Honest

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.201
The bottle's for your boyfriend?

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.940
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:08.578
What?

00:19:08.746 --> 00:19:09.643
Ex-boyfriend

00:19:10.112 --> 00:19:12.135
Such a waste

00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:13.809
Why?

00:19:14.177 --> 00:19:16.302
You're a hunk

00:19:16.478 --> 00:19:18.034
I'm not

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:29.474
That's stunning

00:19:30.976 --> 00:19:33.998
That's what inspired you

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:37.265
I moved here because of it

00:19:41.874 --> 00:19:44.170
Find a motel tonight

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.006
Fly home tomorrow

00:19:46.407 --> 00:19:49.396
I've never traveled

00:19:49.574 --> 00:19:51.267
This is a first

00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:52.769
Think I'll stay a while

00:19:53.573 --> 00:19:54.698
But Hong Kong...

00:19:55.206 --> 00:19:56.263
is boring

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.163
Fly back tomorrow

00:19:58.605 --> 00:20:00.400
My friend said

00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:01.896
Hong Kong's fun

00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:05.665
Great restaurants too

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:08.602
I'll find you...

00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:09.668
a motel

00:20:10.738 --> 00:20:12.567
I can't afford one

00:20:12.803 --> 00:20:13.565
Hands off Wait

00:20:15.037 --> 00:20:16.969
Let me stay here

00:20:17.137 --> 00:20:18.693
Women can't stay here

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:20.925
I'll go nuts

00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:23.933
Please

00:20:24.103 --> 00:20:25.932
Sorry Please

00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:34.491
I came all this way

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.431
To such a big let down

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:41.258
I don't deserve this

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:45.821
Goodbye

00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:52.497
Bu

00:20:52.666 --> 00:20:53.029
What?

00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:53.994
Your suitcase

00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:17.054
Your bag

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:22.020
I can't stand crying

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:24.326
Makes me feel so guilty

00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.852
Okay, stay

00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:29.160
I'll be your aide, in whatever you do

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.655
I'm a makeup artist

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:35.255
Best...

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:37.717
in Hong Kong

00:21:48.925 --> 00:21:49.482
Exquisite

00:21:53.457 --> 00:21:54.047
That's it

00:22:15.955 --> 00:22:17.012
Hold that

00:22:20.054 --> 00:22:20.849
Good

00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:40.312
I'm starving

00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.508
We'll wrap soon

00:22:42.084 --> 00:22:43.482
How much longer?

00:22:44.451 --> 00:22:45.541
6 hours

00:22:46.617 --> 00:22:48.139
What?

00:22:48.384 --> 00:22:51.316
Keep that door shut

00:22:51.817 --> 00:22:53.340
We're reloading

00:22:53.683 --> 00:22:55.239
You'll fog the film

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:35.304
You sound so nervous on the phone
What's the emergency?

00:23:35.678 --> 00:23:37.610
No... no emergency

00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:40.502
I just miss you. You don't miss me?

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:42.974
Sit down, I'll get you a drink

00:23:46.709 --> 00:23:48.107
Tell me, what's going on?

00:23:53.009 --> 00:23:54.202
Maybe you'd better go

00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:21.102
C.N. You're cruising and

00:24:21.273 --> 00:24:22.533
didn't invite me?

00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:25.171
Why bother, here you are

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:27.129
The press says you're romancing my girl

00:24:27.738 --> 00:24:28.795
You believe them?

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:30.397
Grow up, LW

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:34.363
Is it true?

00:24:35.104 --> 00:24:35.626
Yes

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.627
We've been competing since grade school

00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:52.464
You've been interested in...

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:53.566
our stock lately

00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:55.232
I'm interested in all stocks,

00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:56.492
not just yours

00:24:57.701 --> 00:24:59.098
My associates and I

00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:02.025
Hold a majority of the shares

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.857
You can't touch my company

00:25:05.167 --> 00:25:05.825
We'll see

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.959
You're on my yacht

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:11.595
Dating my girl

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.265
And you talk to me like this

00:25:14.765 --> 00:25:16.560
Why did you want me here?

00:25:19.665 --> 00:25:20.631
For an apology

00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:24.458
To make it easier on you

00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.424
I'm leaving now

00:25:26.898 --> 00:25:28.863
Call me...

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.893
to apologize in...

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:32.658
5 minutes

00:25:34.863 --> 00:25:35.886
What time is it?

00:25:37.463 --> 00:25:38.587
5:30

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:40.920
Why wear...

00:25:41.096 --> 00:25:41.823
a watch

00:25:42.062 --> 00:25:43.084
That can't tell time

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:45.322
I like the diamonds

00:25:47.228 --> 00:25:48.091
Watch him

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:50.989
If he doesn't call me in five

00:25:51.528 --> 00:25:52.857
Throw him overboard

00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:55.658
But give him a buoy

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.553
Yes, boss

00:25:57.226 --> 00:25:57.749
Call me

00:26:10.758 --> 00:26:11.689
Bye, boss

00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:15.886
Call him

00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.312
Or you'll get wet

00:26:18.491 --> 00:26:19.252
Make it snappy

00:26:19.423 --> 00:26:21.855
I've got a hot date

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.881
Don't force us to do it

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.083
Get a buoy

00:26:26.257 --> 00:26:26.984
Right

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.380
Come

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.614
Hands off

00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:30.445
Easy

00:26:36.855 --> 00:26:37.843
Almost

00:26:44.587 --> 00:26:45.110
Bye

00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:46.612
Here comes the buoy

00:26:46.788 --> 00:26:47.481
It's Fatty

00:26:49.087 --> 00:26:50.417
Fatty fell over

00:26:55.086 --> 00:26:56.177
Don't go

00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:04.581
Help him up

00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:05.716
Over there

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.775
Scared me

00:27:53.812 --> 00:27:54.903
You okay?

00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:55.803
I'm fine

00:28:10.943 --> 00:28:11.670
Call you

00:28:21.975 --> 00:28:22.703
Where is he?

00:28:33.507 --> 00:28:35.064
Where is he?

00:28:35.774 --> 00:28:36.467
You okay?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.037
Don't fall over again

00:28:42.106 --> 00:28:43.969
You! He's here!

00:28:46.172 --> 00:28:46.933
In the rear

00:28:47.738 --> 00:28:49.068
Help...

00:28:51.172 --> 00:28:52.432
Hold tight

00:28:53.138 --> 00:28:54.399
Close

00:28:58.238 --> 00:28:59.225
You see him?

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:00.527
No

00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:01.336
Look again

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.027
Over there

00:29:36.532 --> 00:29:37.828
He got away

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:38.623
Wait

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.589
The boss wanted him...

00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:42.595
overboard with a buoy

00:29:42.831 --> 00:29:43.956
Job's done, right?

00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:45.129
Right

00:29:45.397 --> 00:29:46.886
It's a wrap

00:30:16.094 --> 00:30:17.082
Thanks

00:30:17.927 --> 00:30:18.722
You okay?

00:30:20.993 --> 00:30:22.619
You're...

00:30:23.626 --> 00:30:24.388
Name's Bu

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.316
Bu?

00:30:28.292 --> 00:30:29.121
You a refugee?

00:30:30.658 --> 00:30:31.749
Yes

00:30:32.959 --> 00:30:33.947
From Vietnam?

00:30:35.191 --> 00:30:36.748
Right again

00:30:37.791 --> 00:30:39.121
How many of you?

00:30:39.691 --> 00:30:40.782
Just me, why?

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.213
Who's driving?

00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:57.853
Give me a hand

00:30:58.388 --> 00:31:02.615
I can't, I'm starving

00:31:03.388 --> 00:31:04.410
Aren't you?

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:08.181
No, but I could use a snack

00:31:16.587 --> 00:31:20.848
Let's talk

00:31:21.019 --> 00:31:22.007
so I forget the hunger

00:31:22.853 --> 00:31:23.580
About what?

00:31:25.818 --> 00:31:28.284
What do you like?

00:31:30.985 --> 00:31:32.973
Nothing?

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:35.847
Not even cars and women?

00:31:38.617 --> 00:31:41.174
Don't just smile

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:43.873
Okay, what don't you like?

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.912
Nosy people

00:32:00.948 --> 00:32:02.277
What don't you like?

00:32:05.447 --> 00:32:09.344
Growing up,

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.507
I like being naughty

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.441
Nosy?

00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:14.977
Naughty

00:32:15.479 --> 00:32:16.173
Naughty

00:32:16.378 --> 00:32:17.173
And no one...

00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:20.300
pampers you anymore

00:32:20.778 --> 00:32:21.540
What do you like?

00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:25.844
A shower when I'm sweaty

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:27.969
Snap out of bed...

00:32:28.377 --> 00:32:30.002
to a cup of coffee

00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:35.106
I'd like one now

00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:40.502
Hong Kong stars are lovely

00:32:41.409 --> 00:32:42.931
Stars are...

00:32:43.576 --> 00:32:45.666
the same everywhere

00:32:46.342 --> 00:32:48.637
If you care to look at them

00:32:53.741 --> 00:32:54.298
What?

00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:55.907
Shooting star!

00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:57.335
Really?

00:32:57.507 --> 00:33:00.234
Mom said when you see one

00:33:00.407 --> 00:33:02.838
Touch your pocket and make a wish

00:33:03.006 --> 00:33:03.903
And it'll come true

00:33:04.339 --> 00:33:05.896
But I'm out of luck, no pocket

00:33:07.673 --> 00:33:09.002
Another one

00:33:20.304 --> 00:33:21.429
What's your wish?

00:33:22.404 --> 00:33:24.427
Can't tell you

00:33:30.303 --> 00:33:32.098
Or it won't come true

00:33:35.836 --> 00:33:36.767
I'm so sleepy

00:34:30.662 --> 00:34:31.889
A boat! Help!

00:34:38.195 --> 00:34:40.683
Over here!

00:35:18.489 --> 00:35:20.250
The Silicon Valley stocks?

00:35:22.922 --> 00:35:25.320
They'll go even higher

00:35:30.121 --> 00:35:31.314
Check one thing

00:35:32.188 --> 00:35:33.847
Does LW control...

00:35:34.253 --> 00:35:35.049
his company's shares?

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.509
Buy me a new mobile

00:35:57.151 --> 00:35:58.117
It drowned

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.481
There's no transport...

00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:12.138
around here

00:36:12.316 --> 00:36:13.645
I'll give you a ride

00:36:14.515 --> 00:36:17.242
Just tell me where I am

00:36:17.415 --> 00:36:18.506
and I'll walk back

00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:20.510
We're out

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:23.306
in the boonies, Miss

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:24.805
Name's Bu

00:36:25.114 --> 00:36:27.137
Boo? Bu!

00:36:27.314 --> 00:36:28.870
Just get in

00:36:29.081 --> 00:36:29.637
Sure

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.743
Not you, this lady here

00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:38.706
There are only 2 seats

00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:40.040
I know

00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:41.909
Here's 20 bucks

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:44.670
Around the corner...

00:36:44.845 --> 00:36:46.606
are buses and cabs

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.964
Compulsive liar

00:37:16.374 --> 00:37:17.170
Come in

00:37:19.674 --> 00:37:21.606
Huge place, you live alone?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.863
There's a butler

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.430
Must get crowded

00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:28.429
Wait here

00:37:28.707 --> 00:37:29.536
Can I look around?

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:30.502
Help yourself

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:31.262
Thanks

00:37:46.237 --> 00:37:47.066
I'm starving

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:55.369
Some food please!

00:38:36.264 --> 00:38:36.958
Need something?

00:38:37.831 --> 00:38:39.023
Fish food

00:38:39.464 --> 00:38:41.487
They're electronic fish

00:38:43.396 --> 00:38:45.056
Come over here

00:38:45.363 --> 00:38:46.761
Why electronic fish?

00:38:47.396 --> 00:38:48.884
I never change the water

00:38:49.063 --> 00:38:50.824
Fish never die, it's perfect

00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:52.027
And if the power's out?

00:38:54.995 --> 00:38:57.859
You invite friends over?

00:38:58.395 --> 00:38:59.122
Don't have any

00:38:59.594 --> 00:39:00.457
So boring, and lonely

00:39:13.759 --> 00:39:14.486
Now what?

00:39:16.392 --> 00:39:17.517
You like to fight?

00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:19.519
Some golf,

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.585
some race horses

00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:24.019
I box and work out

00:39:25.591 --> 00:39:26.818
What's the octopus for?

00:39:27.324 --> 00:39:28.290
You're so nosy

00:39:28.924 --> 00:39:29.617
Sorry

00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:40.183
This should fit, change in there

00:39:53.288 --> 00:39:55.719
Betty, call me a cab

00:39:56.988 --> 00:39:58.214
20 minutes? Great

00:40:26.483 --> 00:40:27.642
There's a room...

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.210
behind the mirror

00:40:32.783 --> 00:40:35.476
How would I have known?

00:40:37.982 --> 00:40:38.505
Hungry?

00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:40.705
Starving

00:40:41.082 --> 00:40:42.241
Me too

00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:45.243
Any Chinese pot rice?

00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:47.071
What?

00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:02.111
Best take out food ever

00:41:02.646 --> 00:41:04.111
My favorite

00:41:05.645 --> 00:41:07.270
A fancy kitchen and you don't cook?

00:41:07.979 --> 00:41:09.035
I hate the smell

00:41:13.045 --> 00:41:15.272
Don't stare. Eat up

00:41:15.778 --> 00:41:16.573
Sure

00:41:33.808 --> 00:41:34.604
Now what?

00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:36.441
You're amusing when you eat

00:41:42.441 --> 00:41:43.270
Are you rich?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.635
I guess so

00:41:46.573 --> 00:41:47.334
What do you do?

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:48.834
I'm into trash

00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:50.473
C'mon

00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:51.962
No, I sell trash

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.930
Be that way

00:42:05.238 --> 00:42:07.101
Can I have a soda?

00:42:07.471 --> 00:42:08.595
Juice is better for you

00:42:32.934 --> 00:42:35.900
Bu took the lift down

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.364
What's wrong?

00:43:08.996 --> 00:43:11.518
Stop moaning

00:43:14.096 --> 00:43:15.823
You know

00:43:16.262 --> 00:43:19.853
That bottle's very special

00:43:20.062 --> 00:43:20.959
So special that...

00:43:21.528 --> 00:43:23.187
all of a sudden

00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:25.224
I'm feeding and sheltering you

00:43:25.395 --> 00:43:26.156
Just like that

00:43:26.495 --> 00:43:29.392
Remember I told you about...

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.526
C. N? More than once

00:43:31.694 --> 00:43:33.852
Last night...

00:43:34.027 --> 00:43:36.322
You told me that too

00:43:36.826 --> 00:43:40.724
I think he's... nice

00:43:40.925 --> 00:43:41.652
Nice?

00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:47.518
These magazines are published weekly

00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:50.385
And he changes girlfriends just as often

00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:54.423
He's not nice, he's a playboy

00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:55.386
Let's see

00:43:56.157 --> 00:43:57.521
An ex-girlfriend says

00:44:01.923 --> 00:44:05.286
He doesn't say sweet words

00:44:05.756 --> 00:44:08.847
But he's a romantic man

00:44:09.555 --> 00:44:12.612
He appears stem and talks tough

00:44:13.222 --> 00:44:15.279
Inside he's like a kid

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:19.243
He's competitive and chases novelty

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.218
Never regrets any decision

00:44:23.187 --> 00:44:24.118
With him...

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.647
You feel insecure

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.751
Meaning?

00:44:29.286 --> 00:44:31.376
Chases novelty, so he fools around

00:44:31.986 --> 00:44:33.508
No regrets,

00:44:33.853 --> 00:44:35.182
so he enjoys dumping women

00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:37.317
Maybe those women deserved it

00:44:37.585 --> 00:44:38.949
They were insecure...

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:41.641
to begin with

00:44:41.918 --> 00:44:43.042
Spare me

00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:48.674
Hong Kong's boring anyway

00:44:50.484 --> 00:44:51.108
Going home?

00:44:51.584 --> 00:44:54.447
No, C.N. Is fun

00:44:56.316 --> 00:44:58.305
You have to hook him first

00:44:58.949 --> 00:44:59.643
Can't just walk up

00:44:59.815 --> 00:45:01.610
And take off your clothes

00:45:01.915 --> 00:45:03.710
That sure won't work

00:45:03.882 --> 00:45:05.438
But you never know

00:45:05.882 --> 00:45:06.938
He's competitive and

00:45:07.115 --> 00:45:09.240
chases novelty

00:45:09.547 --> 00:45:11.513
I have a plan, I need your help

00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:12.374
No way

00:45:13.247 --> 00:45:14.713
Please

00:45:16.147 --> 00:45:16.976
Sorry

00:45:19.713 --> 00:45:20.804
Please tell me

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:21.809
where your daughter is

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.770
She found a bottle

00:45:24.946 --> 00:45:26.310
She's in Hong Kong

00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:30.641
I have to get Bu back

00:45:31.512 --> 00:45:32.307
Chow Yun Fat!

00:45:33.112 --> 00:45:36.441
Mr. Chow

00:45:38.244 --> 00:45:39.800
Wrong guy

00:45:39.977 --> 00:45:40.943
You speak Mandarin?

00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:43.140
I'm not Chow Yun Fat

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:44.970
Don't try to fool me

00:45:45.143 --> 00:45:46.870
Sir, is he Chow Yun Fat?

00:45:47.943 --> 00:45:50.171
Mr. Chow, you're back!

00:45:50.442 --> 00:45:51.567
Fresh form Hollywood?

00:45:51.743 --> 00:45:52.936
Please sign Can I take a picture?

00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:55.632
You mind? OK

00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:59.472
But... 1,2,3... say cheese

00:45:59.642 --> 00:46:02.903
My turn, miss

00:46:03.274 --> 00:46:05.535
Point a gun at me

00:46:05.707 --> 00:46:08.138
Ready, 1, 2 Ready 1, 2, 3...

00:46:08.974 --> 00:46:11.599
Thank you, Mr. Chow

00:46:12.173 --> 00:46:14.730
Give me a hug

00:46:17.606 --> 00:46:20.003
Thank you Mr. Chow Thank you

00:46:20.306 --> 00:46:21.601
I'll send you the photos

00:46:21.772 --> 00:46:23.068
Bye You're so sweet

00:46:23.238 --> 00:46:24.100
Same as the photo

00:46:24.171 --> 00:46:25.159
Print me a copy

00:46:27.005 --> 00:46:28.630
He's such a hunk Bye

00:46:28.804 --> 00:46:29.667
Bye

00:46:31.838 --> 00:46:32.633
My bag!

00:46:39.269 --> 00:46:40.667
We checked LW's company

00:46:41.003 --> 00:46:42.162
Last year,

00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:43.665
rumover grew 13%

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:46.595
Profit: Over HK$1 billion

00:46:46.969 --> 00:46:49.594
Stock price is undervalued by 30%

00:46:50.035 --> 00:46:51.160
We have acquired...

00:46:51.335 --> 00:46:53.527
16% of the company

00:46:53.935 --> 00:46:57.059
LW and his associates...

00:46:57.234 --> 00:46:59.496
still hold 65%

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.857
But...

00:47:02.134 --> 00:47:03.599
they're not selling

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.357
Dump all my stocks

00:47:07.933 --> 00:47:10.296
If we dump them,

00:47:10.466 --> 00:47:11.591
the price will plunge

00:47:11.766 --> 00:47:15.925
We bought high, we'll take a huge loss

00:47:16.432 --> 00:47:18.397
Just do it

00:47:21.665 --> 00:47:22.631
I need to see K.K.

00:47:22.931 --> 00:47:23.624
Yes, sir

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:25.326
Who's K. K?

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.291
Head of Environmental Protection

00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:29.655
Going up or down?

00:48:30.123 --> 00:48:32.418
I was seeing friends upstairs

00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:33.784
There's no upstairs

00:48:35.022 --> 00:48:35.817
Really?

00:48:37.222 --> 00:48:40.187
Actually they live downstairs

00:48:40.455 --> 00:48:41.079
Names?

00:48:42.587 --> 00:48:43.985
I forgot

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.477
So quiet here

00:48:49.853 --> 00:48:52.285
Can you get an 80% mortgage?

00:48:52.486 --> 00:48:53.975
You messed up my wall

00:48:55.986 --> 00:48:57.009
Excuse me?

00:49:04.585 --> 00:49:06.312
Look!

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.041
Easy there

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.743
Let go

00:49:16.917 --> 00:49:17.712
Who sent you?

00:49:18.583 --> 00:49:19.378
Let go first

00:49:21.882 --> 00:49:22.643
Like my writing?

00:49:34.414 --> 00:49:37.039
Enough. I don't know kungfu

00:49:37.381 --> 00:49:38.539
I'm just a messenger

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.404
Message?

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.107
My back pocket

00:49:50.779 --> 00:49:55.370
Bully. You messed up my arm

00:49:55.545 --> 00:49:56.533
Happy reading

00:49:59.011 --> 00:49:59.443
Gangster's girlfriend...

00:49:59.612 --> 00:50:00.202
disappears

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.203
What happened?

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.201
Fell down some stairs

00:50:09.377 --> 00:50:10.035
You okay?

00:50:10.277 --> 00:50:10.640
I'll live

00:50:11.177 --> 00:50:13.267
Will he buy...

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.773
I'll a gangster's girlfriend?

00:50:15.009 --> 00:50:16.134
How should I know?

00:50:16.709 --> 00:50:17.834
Will it work?

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:19.365
Of course

00:50:21.675 --> 00:50:22.698
What's next?

00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:24.965
Showtime

00:50:25.141 --> 00:50:26.504
Where are your pals?

00:50:34.374 --> 00:50:35.930
You know we're bad

00:50:36.107 --> 00:50:37.629
We're here to waste you

00:50:38.273 --> 00:50:39.170
React!

00:50:39.772 --> 00:50:40.999
My boyfriend... Speak Mandarin

00:50:41.173 --> 00:50:44.627
Is a Taiwanese gangster

00:50:44.806 --> 00:50:46.271
The sworn enemy of our boss

00:50:46.439 --> 00:50:48.462
He wants you defaced

00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:50.536
Frog, your turn

00:50:50.771 --> 00:50:52.327
Believe it or not

00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:54.500
You're front page news

00:50:54.971 --> 00:50:57.630
Everyone's looking for you now

00:51:00.904 --> 00:51:02.164
Yes. Looking awesome

00:51:28.434 --> 00:51:29.024
You okay?

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.629
Yes, and you?

00:51:32.633 --> 00:51:33.394
It's you!

00:51:33.633 --> 00:51:34.098
You okay?

00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:34.923
Yes

00:51:40.465 --> 00:51:41.396
I don't know these goons

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:42.155
What?

00:51:42.498 --> 00:51:42.929
Nothing

00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:15.688
You can't be ID'ed

00:52:17.328 --> 00:52:18.816
They're damn good actors

00:53:29.718 --> 00:53:30.877
Back off

00:53:32.651 --> 00:53:33.082
Stay here

00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:35.308
Yeah, or I'll kill myself

00:53:35.617 --> 00:53:36.708
You're bleeding

00:53:38.784 --> 00:53:40.511
We'll spare you today

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.647
Don't provoke him

00:53:43.716 --> 00:53:45.909
Cops will go after them

00:53:46.183 --> 00:53:46.739
Not us

00:53:48.949 --> 00:53:49.915
Hi, there

00:53:50.282 --> 00:53:56.544
Sunny, sit... Sunny, sit

00:53:57.114 --> 00:53:57.875
Thanks

00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:00.108
Someone reported a fight

00:54:00.281 --> 00:54:01.008
We were attacked

00:54:01.281 --> 00:54:02.371
They leave any evidence?

00:54:02.714 --> 00:54:03.771
Baseball bats

00:54:05.681 --> 00:54:07.442
Sunny, smell

00:54:08.613 --> 00:54:10.170
Any clues?

00:54:21.145 --> 00:54:23.441
Sunny, you're clueless

00:54:24.078 --> 00:54:25.509
Let's get help

00:54:30.544 --> 00:54:32.032
My site, very safe

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.169
It's so trashy

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.839
I told you I sell trash

00:54:37.176 --> 00:54:38.801
Expensive stuff too

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.103
Expensive? Trash is trash

00:54:42.842 --> 00:54:44.068
Before you were...

00:54:44.375 --> 00:54:45.432
a Vietnamese refugee

00:54:45.808 --> 00:54:47.035
Now you're...

00:54:47.342 --> 00:54:49.364
A Taiwanese gangster's girlfriend

00:54:49.908 --> 00:54:51.305
So who are you, really?

00:54:51.808 --> 00:54:54.602
A dangerous woman

00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:55.737
Scared?

00:54:56.507 --> 00:54:57.370
Never

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.499
Thrilled to be with me?

00:55:04.906 --> 00:55:07.201
How'd you land the girlfriend's part?

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:11.698
I lived near a police station

00:55:11.972 --> 00:55:14.733
with posters of wanted criminals

00:55:15.338 --> 00:55:19.565
One of them was a hunk

00:55:20.004 --> 00:55:22.492
I saw his poster everyday

00:55:23.137 --> 00:55:25.898
And I fell in love

00:55:26.203 --> 00:55:26.930
And?

00:55:27.803 --> 00:55:31.098
I found him, stole his heart

00:55:32.036 --> 00:55:33.525
How was he?

00:55:34.602 --> 00:55:38.159
Cute, a great dancer

00:55:40.368 --> 00:55:41.856
Really romantic

00:55:43.568 --> 00:55:44.795
For being a dancer?

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.757
You dance?

00:55:48.334 --> 00:55:48.958
Of course

00:55:52.134 --> 00:55:53.031
This?

00:55:55.099 --> 00:55:55.758
Sure

00:55:57.666 --> 00:55:58.825
Tango?

00:56:03.532 --> 00:56:04.293
That too

00:56:05.232 --> 00:56:08.322
So common, nothing more exciting?

00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:10.060
Sure Really?

00:56:10.531 --> 00:56:11.928
Teach me

00:56:13.797 --> 00:56:14.626
You'll be scared

00:56:14.864 --> 00:56:15.761
No way

00:56:18.297 --> 00:56:19.285
Hold me

00:56:19.764 --> 00:56:20.922
Give me your legs

00:56:21.196 --> 00:56:22.127
Right

00:56:23.163 --> 00:56:23.787
Ready?

00:56:26.995 --> 00:56:27.858
Help!

00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:34.652
Exciting enough?

00:56:34.828 --> 00:56:35.316
Yes

00:56:35.928 --> 00:56:36.417
No more?

00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:37.485
You aren't scared?

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:38.353
Never

00:56:38.994 --> 00:56:39.960
More moves?

00:56:43.927 --> 00:56:45.790
Just hold tight and

00:56:45.993 --> 00:56:46.720
stay still

00:56:47.093 --> 00:56:48.184
Enjoy the variations

00:56:48.459 --> 00:56:48.823
Really? Okay?

00:56:48.993 --> 00:56:49.549
Okay...

00:56:49.726 --> 00:56:50.384
There

00:56:51.092 --> 00:56:52.648
Run, 1, 2, 3

00:57:01.658 --> 00:57:04.351
Wow! This is fun

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.183
Man's so busy

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.783
Making trash

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:13.583
The recycling business is a gold mine

00:57:14.189 --> 00:57:14.655
They say...

00:57:14.823 --> 00:57:16.617
What others abandon, I take

00:57:18.123 --> 00:57:19.349
You did well last time

00:57:20.155 --> 00:57:22.678
Slapped Lion Fund in the face

00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:25.554
They all know you're my protégé

00:57:25.821 --> 00:57:26.650
I'm flattered

00:57:26.922 --> 00:57:27.546
Thank you

00:57:28.254 --> 00:57:31.618
Don't thank me, thank yourself

00:57:32.254 --> 00:57:34.651
Any new plans?

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.511
I heard you're buying LW's company

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.542
You know

00:57:42.886 --> 00:57:44.681
what's the best win?

00:57:46.852 --> 00:57:49.511
Winning one's battle...

00:57:50.152 --> 00:57:52.709
with the enemy's respect

00:57:59.784 --> 00:58:00.807
Stock Exchange's closed

00:58:00.984 --> 00:58:01.711
And?

00:58:02.617 --> 00:58:05.673
Our stock dropped 20%

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:06.975
Closed at $6.50

00:58:10.283 --> 00:58:11.510
Our drop in asset value?

00:58:12.682 --> 00:58:14.511
Over 2 billion

00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:16.947
It's Chan,

00:58:17.115 --> 00:58:18.240
he's dumping our shares

00:58:20.448 --> 00:58:22.310
What's the news on him?

00:58:23.181 --> 00:58:25.442
Rumors are he wants...

00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:26.943
to buy our company

00:58:27.947 --> 00:58:29.572
Then...

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.807
why dump his shares?

00:58:33.079 --> 00:58:36.636
After buying them so high?

00:58:38.279 --> 00:58:41.541
What's he up to?

00:58:42.245 --> 00:58:43.040
Boss

00:58:48.378 --> 00:58:49.275
What happened to you?

00:58:49.645 --> 00:58:51.167
We wanted to get even. We ambushed Chan

00:58:51.478 --> 00:58:52.307
Was he hurt?

00:58:52.944 --> 00:58:54.341
Not a scratch

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:55.940
Thank God

00:58:56.377 --> 00:58:57.138
Else...

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:58.503
I'd blame myself

00:58:58.943 --> 00:58:59.966
And if...

00:59:00.143 --> 00:59:02.506
Well,

00:59:02.676 --> 00:59:03.937
you actually were hurt

00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:06.965
And see, I feel guilty

00:59:07.142 --> 00:59:08.698
It was your dad's idea

00:59:10.375 --> 00:59:11.932
He screwed up

00:59:12.441 --> 00:59:14.066
Ordering an ambush

00:59:14.441 --> 00:59:15.963
Why not shoot Chan in the back?

00:59:16.507 --> 00:59:18.735
That's much faster

00:59:19.108 --> 00:59:21.232
Let's do it

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.435
No, it's wrong, it's cowardly

00:59:26.773 --> 00:59:28.796
Challenge him openly

00:59:29.906 --> 00:59:31.167
Right

00:59:32.839 --> 00:59:35.862
Yes!

00:59:36.938 --> 00:59:39.234
Let's hire a fighter from overseas

00:59:40.471 --> 00:59:41.596
Tougher

00:59:43.005 --> 00:59:44.766
Smaller

00:59:45.937 --> 00:59:46.766
And...

00:59:47.237 --> 00:59:48.634
Handsomer than Chan

00:59:49.037 --> 00:59:51.093
He'll be devastated

00:59:59.602 --> 01:00:00.192
What's that?

01:00:01.269 --> 01:00:05.667
The signal means "Dismissed". Beat it

01:00:06.334 --> 01:00:07.129
Tricky signals

01:00:16.734 --> 01:00:18.495
Have you seen her?

01:00:19.799 --> 01:00:21.731
That's Mary

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.990
No, that's Bunny

01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:25.357
No, that's Mary

01:00:25.533 --> 01:00:27.930
That's Bunny, come with me

01:00:28.132 --> 01:00:31.063
No, that way

01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:33.021
No

01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:35.322
Another Bunny?

01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:37.859
A masseuse

01:00:38.197 --> 01:00:39.720
A masseuse?

01:00:39.997 --> 01:00:40.963
Why not?

01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:04.025
Oh my God, what's he doing?

01:01:23.491 --> 01:01:24.787
Albert!

01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:29.384
Do I look pretty?

01:01:30.091 --> 01:01:30.886
Yes

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:34.019
What?

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.322
Your outfit

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:38.579
My Sunday best

01:01:40.257 --> 01:01:41.779
Go to...

01:01:41.956 --> 01:01:43.148
Jean-Paul's Boutique

01:01:43.322 --> 01:01:44.618
I'll call him,

01:01:44.855 --> 01:01:46.014
let him dress you

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:48.921
You feed, shelter,

01:01:49.089 --> 01:01:50.918
and clothe me

01:01:51.088 --> 01:01:51.985
You're my guardian angel

01:01:53.054 --> 01:01:54.111
Your wish is...

01:01:54.421 --> 01:01:56.477
my command

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:57.344
Bye

01:01:59.487 --> 01:01:59.884
What?

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.352
How should I behave at dinner?

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.543
You're playing a gangster's lady

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.083
Use method acting

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.242
Teach me

01:02:12.552 --> 01:02:13.449
Just act snooty

01:02:14.418 --> 01:02:16.008
Feed, shelter, and clothe her

01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:19.774
I'm an angel

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.443
She forgot something?

01:02:26.516 --> 01:02:27.504
Yes?

01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:30.044
Help!

01:02:30.216 --> 01:02:30.977
It's you!

01:02:31.149 --> 01:02:38.047
Where's Bu?

01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:47.139
Please tell me where she is

01:02:59.246 --> 01:02:59.836
Mr. Chan

01:03:00.046 --> 01:03:00.534
Thanks

01:03:05.446 --> 01:03:05.877
Mr. Chan

01:03:25.142 --> 01:03:25.767
What's this?

01:03:26.576 --> 01:03:27.473
Excuse me

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.670
The lady's so lovely

01:03:29.909 --> 01:03:32.397
She deserves some wind effect

01:03:34.675 --> 01:03:35.436
You look gorgeous

01:03:35.741 --> 01:03:36.435
I know

01:03:47.339 --> 01:03:48.134
Well?

01:03:49.373 --> 01:03:51.430
A vintage wine, from '82

01:03:57.005 --> 01:04:00.494
But I can also tell

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.469
The grape-picker was born in '60

01:04:07.304 --> 01:04:08.065
Let's order

01:04:12.403 --> 01:04:13.334
You order

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.336
You do Chinese Pot Rice?

01:04:20.135 --> 01:04:21.431
Just kidding

01:04:21.935 --> 01:04:22.764
Thank God!

01:04:27.568 --> 01:04:30.193
You got a thing about people
watching you eat?

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:34.696
We don't want to be crowded

01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:41.763
Excuse me

01:04:43.933 --> 01:04:45.592
You booked the whole place?

01:04:46.932 --> 01:04:48.522
Just you and me

01:04:49.732 --> 01:04:51.254
I was hoping

01:04:51.498 --> 01:04:53.794
To run into celebrities

01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:56.219
You must really...

01:04:56.398 --> 01:04:57.954
hate crowds

01:04:58.131 --> 01:04:59.391
What about your friends?

01:05:04.463 --> 01:05:05.827
Here comes one

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:08.752
Mr. Lo, you can't go in

01:05:12.562 --> 01:05:15.790
Why'd you do it?

01:05:16.262 --> 01:05:18.989
Dump my company's shares?

01:05:19.195 --> 01:05:19.956
I'm at dinner,

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:21.116
call me tomorrow

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:26.354
You're hurting me

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:28.389
And yourself too

01:05:28.593 --> 01:05:31.559
Mr. Lo, please leave

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:32.889
Sir

01:05:33.493 --> 01:05:34.822
You look intelligent

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.584
I am intelligent

01:05:37.126 --> 01:05:39.024
Then stay home and think

01:05:39.192 --> 01:05:40.715
Devise a way...

01:05:40.892 --> 01:05:42.721
to save your company

01:05:44.425 --> 01:05:45.914
Who are you?

01:05:46.391 --> 01:05:47.448
C.N.'s friend

01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:49.724
He booked the whole place for me

01:05:50.358 --> 01:05:52.324
You're disturbing us

01:05:52.757 --> 01:05:54.950
That's so rude

01:05:58.756 --> 01:06:00.517
Let's talk outside

01:06:01.823 --> 01:06:02.686
We've talked enough

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:05.485
See you outside

01:06:09.455 --> 01:06:12.852
That signal means "Follow me"

01:06:13.422 --> 01:06:14.410
Wrong again?

01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:20.845
You're snooty

01:06:21.654 --> 01:06:23.482
So are my friends

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.016
it rubs off

01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:29.574
You have to go?

01:06:31.886 --> 01:06:34.875
It'll just take a minute

01:06:44.551 --> 01:06:45.346
C.N.

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:48.775
Watch your back

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.309
Watch your back

01:07:01.915 --> 01:07:02.539
I called,

01:07:02.915 --> 01:07:05.608
cleared it with your boss

01:07:06.015 --> 01:07:07.480
I'm meeting Mr. Chan

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:10.409
Close the parking lot for us

01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:13.739
Relax, I'm footing the bill

01:07:13.981 --> 01:07:14.571
Fine, Mr. Lo

01:07:15.013 --> 01:07:16.445
You heard Mr. Lo, move out

01:07:19.147 --> 01:07:20.806
Have fun, Mr. Chan

01:07:22.713 --> 01:07:23.303
LW

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:25.042
What's up?

01:07:25.513 --> 01:07:27.206
I want you to meet someone

01:07:27.578 --> 01:07:29.237
I hired him from overseas

01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:31.342
Ladies and gentlemen

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:34.041
Alan

01:07:39.110 --> 01:07:43.065
An undefeated light-weight champion

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:47.874
He'll fight you one-on-one

01:07:49.676 --> 01:07:50.937
But...

01:07:51.143 --> 01:07:52.506
I'm a middle-weight

01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:54.199
Too much of an edge

01:07:54.442 --> 01:07:57.669
But if you lose

01:07:58.042 --> 01:08:01.269
Think of the disgrace

01:08:03.007 --> 01:08:05.564
Grow up

01:08:05.807 --> 01:08:06.830
Nuts

01:08:07.907 --> 01:08:08.736
Play this music for me

01:08:08.907 --> 01:08:09.804
No problem

01:09:01.933 --> 01:09:03.364
You have no choice

01:09:05.932 --> 01:09:06.989
Why the gloves?

01:09:07.299 --> 01:09:09.356
This is a boxing match

01:09:09.599 --> 01:09:10.565
I'm not...

01:09:10.766 --> 01:09:11.424
into crippling people

01:09:12.033 --> 01:09:13.623
With gloves, it won't hurt?

01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:16.094
Sure it'll hurt

01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:17.958
But much less

01:09:22.398 --> 01:09:23.489
All set

01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:24.922
Watch your head

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:27.989
Music

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:30.229
Knock me down anyway you can

01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:32.953
But no dirty tricks

01:09:36.162 --> 01:09:38.821
They say you're a great fighter. Come on

01:09:41.828 --> 01:09:45.590
Look! They're not gonna
let you leave here without a fight

01:09:51.128 --> 01:09:52.094
You ask for it

01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:54.349
Are you ready?

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:55.151
Of course

01:09:59.027 --> 01:09:59.720
Alan's losing big time

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.457
No, Alan's just testing him

01:10:02.759 --> 01:10:04.248
He's wearing Chan down

01:10:19.224 --> 01:10:22.519
Wait Good

01:10:31.188 --> 01:10:32.347
Changing gloves, why?

01:10:32.922 --> 01:10:33.887
Even the odds

01:10:34.322 --> 01:10:35.719
Bigger the glove,

01:10:35.955 --> 01:10:37.182
bigger the handicap

01:10:37.588 --> 01:10:40.179
Chan's punches are soft

01:10:46.021 --> 01:10:47.247
I've come a long way,

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.042
I don't want a short game

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:53.518
Every boxer trains...

01:10:53.853 --> 01:10:54.876
to his own music

01:10:55.053 --> 01:10:55.916
When he fights,

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:57.779
it give him rhythm

01:10:58.152 --> 01:10:59.811
And rhythm paces his steps

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:05.710
Chan has no rhythm

01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:08.183
He's controlled by Alan

01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:10.314
You're an expert

01:11:10.484 --> 01:11:11.041
You should be fighting

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:12.074
Right

01:11:12.584 --> 01:11:14.311
C.N. And I used to box

01:11:14.517 --> 01:11:15.812
But I always lost

01:11:16.317 --> 01:11:17.509
So I quit and became a...

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:18.741
Commentator

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:19.574
Wow!

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.281
You like that better?

01:11:21.815 --> 01:11:24.474
Sure. I sound so invincible

01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:26.113
But I'm just like you guys

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.205
Helpless

01:11:35.948 --> 01:11:38.140
Chan used to have brilliant moves

01:11:38.381 --> 01:11:39.210
Now he's a mess

01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:43.308
Buying companies...

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.241
instead of training

01:11:44.413 --> 01:11:46.402
Loser!

01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:18.570
Chan's nervous, it's over

01:13:23.001 --> 01:13:26.592
Good hit, but not enough power

01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:45.928
Come on

01:14:26.326 --> 01:14:27.313
You okay?

01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:29.925
You win

01:14:32.758 --> 01:14:34.849
We won

01:14:35.192 --> 01:14:37.555
Let's kick him while he's down

01:14:37.858 --> 01:14:38.982
Good idea

01:14:42.857 --> 01:14:44.050
Don't be...

01:14:44.657 --> 01:14:46.486
such cowards

01:14:47.256 --> 01:14:48.619
Ganging up on a downed man

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:50.721
There's no honor in that

01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.916
You're good

01:14:59.888 --> 01:15:00.512
Get the car

01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:09.216
My joy is done. He's good

01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:17.814
C.N., you okay?

01:15:20.286 --> 01:15:21.945
You must be delighted

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:26.384
No, but I thought I would be

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.083
You need help?

01:15:36.117 --> 01:15:36.912
Damn it

01:15:42.183 --> 01:15:44.671
C.N., call me

01:16:19.545 --> 01:16:20.272
You didn't leave?

01:16:20.778 --> 01:16:22.243
You asked me to wait

01:16:23.044 --> 01:16:25.407
I came to find you

01:16:27.777 --> 01:16:30.265
Did they gang up on you?

01:16:30.577 --> 01:16:33.633
No, one-on-one, I lost

01:16:35.043 --> 01:16:38.304
You'll get used to it

01:16:40.109 --> 01:16:41.166
Just kidding

01:16:41.976 --> 01:16:45.339
Start training tomorrow,
you'll beat them

01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:50.105
I'll train, but not for them

01:16:50.874 --> 01:16:52.567
For what then?

01:16:54.441 --> 01:16:57.463
A strong body, a quick mind

01:16:58.873 --> 01:17:00.600
I haven't trained in ages

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.103
Your huge gym, what a waste

01:17:06.973 --> 01:17:08.268
I hate training alone

01:17:10.972 --> 01:17:12.961
I'll join you

01:17:15.705 --> 01:17:16.693
Why be so nice to me?

01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:19.062
You're rich

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:23.126
You're cute when you smile

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:26.635
You looked grouchy just now

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:29.727
That's why you lost

01:17:30.536 --> 01:17:31.900
Stick with smiling

01:17:33.369 --> 01:17:35.926
These clothes and makeup don't fit you

01:17:40.234 --> 01:17:41.700
Take tomorrow off

01:17:41.968 --> 01:17:42.626
Why?

01:17:43.034 --> 01:17:44.261
Say yes first

01:17:44.467 --> 01:17:44.865
Why?

01:17:45.234 --> 01:17:46.358
Say yes first

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.491
Yes, now why?

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:50.627
Play!

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.198
Memories are so many

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.424
Anticipation I now dare to indulge

01:18:00.999 --> 01:18:05.363
I sketch a hazy future

01:18:06.298 --> 01:18:10.696
Knowing this illusion is love

01:18:11.064 --> 01:18:15.360
The tides of a lifetime

01:18:15.897 --> 01:18:20.591
Widen the shores slowly

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:25.518
Quietly you and I meet

01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:31.120
Our love proves life is ever changing

01:18:32.262 --> 01:18:37.421
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:18:37.595 --> 01:18:42.390
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.390
Like eternity

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:50.983
Is the night really still young?

01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:57.585
Currents change courses too
(We fall in love)

01:18:57.758 --> 01:19:02.587
The crowds catch up with us (Finally)

01:19:02.757 --> 01:19:06.553
I can think no more

01:19:07.090 --> 01:19:08.919
But this love

01:19:09.623 --> 01:19:13.919
Links the sea with the sky

01:19:37.687 --> 01:19:41.948
My eyes have been raining

01:19:42.686 --> 01:19:47.015
I can't hold on with both hands

01:19:47.586 --> 01:19:51.813
I cry as we seek happiness

01:19:52.251 --> 01:19:57.411
You're just like a shooting star

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:02.148
Those happy moments

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:07.443
Lock you between my brows

01:20:07.816 --> 01:20:12.145
No matter how the world dazzles

01:20:12.748 --> 01:20:17.908
It pales next to your eternal splendor

01:20:18.748 --> 01:20:24.270
Shooting stars change courses
(We fall in love)

01:20:24.447 --> 01:20:29.038
Miracles catch up with us (Finally)

01:20:29.213 --> 01:20:32.269
Like eternity

01:20:33.379 --> 01:20:37.970
Is the night really still young?

01:20:38.612 --> 01:20:39.407
You love me?

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:42.976
I think you're quite...

01:20:43.145 --> 01:20:45.508
Answer the question

01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:47.472
The fact is...

01:20:47.644 --> 01:20:49.576
C'mon

01:20:50.277 --> 01:20:53.368
Answer in 4 words or less

01:20:53.877 --> 01:20:56.968
I love you

01:20:58.109 --> 01:21:00.734
Or I don't

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:24.366
When did you slip in?

01:21:24.604 --> 01:21:28.730
I'm in love

01:21:28.904 --> 01:21:34.302
Love's a dream
that leaves only emptiness

01:21:34.836 --> 01:21:39.893
So don't get fooled by love

01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:44.826
You're such an optimist

01:21:47.034 --> 01:21:48.863
I have news for you

01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:50.195
What?

01:21:50.434 --> 01:21:51.661
Longyi's here

01:21:54.667 --> 01:21:55.996
He almost strangled me

01:21:56.367 --> 01:21:58.491
But I calmed him down

01:21:58.967 --> 01:22:00.523
He's been drunk ever since

01:22:01.866 --> 01:22:03.526
My fault

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:07.561
No way

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:10.730
Listen, love is not sympathy

01:22:11.098 --> 01:22:13.155
You're tangled up...

01:22:13.332 --> 01:22:14.319
with Chan

01:22:14.498 --> 01:22:15.486
Don't let Longyi see you

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.928
Wine please No

01:22:23.097 --> 01:22:24.323
Wait

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:25.493
Let go

01:22:25.963 --> 01:22:26.622
No

01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:27.820
Kitchen time

01:22:27.996 --> 01:22:28.552
Kitchen

01:22:30.829 --> 01:22:31.852
I need...

01:22:36.495 --> 01:22:37.325
What?

01:22:37.895 --> 01:22:38.758
I...

01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:41.219
I need a glass

01:22:41.394 --> 01:22:42.791
I'll get it

01:22:44.594 --> 01:22:45.253
Go inside

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:48.051
No pushing

01:22:50.926 --> 01:22:53.222
Albert

01:22:55.893 --> 01:22:57.222
Where's the opener?

01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:01.454
Albert

01:23:03.258 --> 01:23:04.189
Smooth move

01:23:05.291 --> 01:23:06.984
So cold!

01:23:07.158 --> 01:23:08.055
Albert

01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:11.381
Now what?

01:23:12.257 --> 01:23:15.620
I need the opener

01:23:19.057 --> 01:23:20.613
Where is it?

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.217
Hurry!

01:23:27.856 --> 01:23:28.753
What's that?

01:23:30.621 --> 01:23:33.087
The family above us

01:23:33.255 --> 01:23:34.743
Has a brat

01:23:35.954 --> 01:23:37.420
It's from above us?

01:23:38.588 --> 01:23:40.951
Where else?

01:23:55.219 --> 01:23:56.650
It's from above us

01:23:57.418 --> 01:24:00.009
It's that brat again

01:24:01.084 --> 01:24:02.311
Opener

01:24:02.917 --> 01:24:03.712
Forget it

01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:07.915
Drink it this way

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:10.543
Wait Come

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:12.548
Drink with me

01:24:15.716 --> 01:24:16.374
You okay?

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:20.079
I must tell C.N.

01:24:20.249 --> 01:24:21.475
A game...

01:24:21.648 --> 01:24:22.807
is fun

01:24:22.982 --> 01:24:25.243
Till its secret is revealed

01:24:25.648 --> 01:24:29.340
I know he loves me

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:33.812
He skips work to be with me

01:24:34.147 --> 01:24:37.170
I miss him day and night

01:24:37.813 --> 01:24:40.108
I'm like a child again

01:24:40.346 --> 01:24:43.278
Getting so attached to him

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.773
I see something beautiful

01:24:46.145 --> 01:24:47.805
I want it for him

01:24:48.245 --> 01:24:51.642
Something happens, I want to tell him

01:24:52.078 --> 01:24:55.339
I'm so happy

01:24:55.877 --> 01:24:56.639
And...

01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:57.637
so cold!

01:24:58.377 --> 01:24:59.933
You're in love

01:25:03.176 --> 01:25:03.835
Need something?

01:25:04.443 --> 01:25:05.703
Sake

01:25:06.043 --> 01:25:07.168
Finish your wine first

01:25:07.343 --> 01:25:08.933
I want sake

01:25:09.275 --> 01:25:11.468
Just wait outside Sake

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.035
Hang on

01:25:17.675 --> 01:25:18.970
Excuse me

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:29.171
Let's sing

01:25:29.373 --> 01:25:31.429
This is not a Karaoke bar

01:25:32.439 --> 01:25:33.735
We don't have time

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.962
We'll split this

01:25:35.139 --> 01:25:35.696
Too much

01:25:35.972 --> 01:25:37.370
Not at all

01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:38.899
Enough

01:25:40.538 --> 01:25:41.765
Cheers

01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:46.337
You'll get drunk

01:25:48.504 --> 01:25:50.527
Drink it

01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:56.497
1... 2... 3...

01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:57.601
Down!

01:26:09.268 --> 01:26:10.460
Still kicking. Thank God

01:26:31.399 --> 01:26:33.126
She's safe here

01:26:38.431 --> 01:26:39.692
Here she is

01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:53.818
Gloria, Bu

01:26:54.196 --> 01:26:55.253
Gloria's a good friend

01:26:56.563 --> 01:26:58.391
She's the one impersonating me?

01:26:58.862 --> 01:26:59.259
Yes!

01:26:59.428 --> 01:27:00.325
Not bad

01:27:05.395 --> 01:27:07.417
You knew all along

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.319
Why con me?

01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:13.885
You started it

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:19.017
All the love I felt between us

01:27:19.193 --> 01:27:23.818
That was just an act?

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:26.614
Our happiness was no act

01:27:27.459 --> 01:27:28.447
If you like,

01:27:29.258 --> 01:27:30.655
stay in Hong Kong

01:27:32.257 --> 01:27:33.621
What am I?

01:27:35.191 --> 01:27:36.884
One of your women?

01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:44.381
The bottle sent me to you

01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:48.619
A fairy tale becomes...

01:27:50.422 --> 01:27:52.081
a nightmare

01:28:09.453 --> 01:28:10.680
My big mouth

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:12.543
No

01:28:13.419 --> 01:28:14.407
Get her back

01:28:14.718 --> 01:28:15.241
No

01:28:20.019 --> 01:28:22.143
Weren't we on the same plane?

01:28:24.051 --> 01:28:24.948
Back to Taiwan?

01:28:25.218 --> 01:28:25.706
Yes

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:27.273
You had fun?

01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:28.878
It was okay

01:28:29.717 --> 01:28:31.080
I bought a lot,

01:28:31.317 --> 01:28:32.283
what about you?

01:28:34.316 --> 01:28:35.509
I...

01:28:35.917 --> 01:28:37.212
I bought a story

01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:38.911
A story!

01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:40.445
Is it in an office building?

01:28:54.381 --> 01:28:55.176
The government passed a law...

01:28:55.347 --> 01:28:56.937
prohibiting the use...

01:28:57.413 --> 01:28:58.572
of non-bio-degradable

01:28:58.747 --> 01:29:00.679
styrofoam

01:29:01.046 --> 01:29:01.740
LW's stock...

01:29:01.913 --> 01:29:04.970
dropped drastically

01:29:05.479 --> 01:29:07.877
From $6.80 to $1.20 a share

01:29:08.245 --> 01:29:09.767
Major stockholders,

01:29:09.945 --> 01:29:11.206
are dumping them

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:12.136
You knew...

01:29:12.312 --> 01:29:14.209
the law would be passed?

01:29:15.545 --> 01:29:17.306
It was only a matter of time

01:29:17.478 --> 01:29:19.307
Should we borrow money?

01:29:19.478 --> 01:29:20.773
Up to you guys

01:29:21.211 --> 01:29:21.835
Mr. Chan,

01:29:22.011 --> 01:29:24.408
you shouldn't buy a company
that's going down the drain

01:29:24.710 --> 01:29:26.573
Just to...

01:29:26.743 --> 01:29:27.674
get even

01:29:27.976 --> 01:29:29.237
I won't

01:29:30.543 --> 01:29:31.668
That's all for today

01:29:31.843 --> 01:29:32.399
The acquisition...

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:34.565
is a go?

01:29:34.875 --> 01:29:35.533
I'll let you know

01:30:51.298 --> 01:31:00.821
Love is like falling maples

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.255
Like what?

01:31:04.463 --> 01:31:09.327
Like falling maples

01:31:09.496 --> 01:31:11.086
What does that mean?

01:31:11.929 --> 01:31:12.758
I don't know

01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:17.617
I've never seen you like this

01:31:17.795 --> 01:31:19.352
Paper everywhere

01:31:20.095 --> 01:31:21.560
Just do...

01:31:21.728 --> 01:31:23.626
what you have to do

01:31:24.328 --> 01:31:24.986
Again?

01:31:25.528 --> 01:31:26.652
Forget it

01:31:27.961 --> 01:31:28.517
What?

01:31:28.961 --> 01:31:30.256
Nothing

01:31:30.493 --> 01:31:31.981
Leave me alone

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.483
Fine, be that way

01:31:41.192 --> 01:31:42.919
You broke it?

01:31:43.292 --> 01:31:43.950
Good guess

01:31:45.358 --> 01:31:45.847
Sir

01:31:46.024 --> 01:31:46.820
Call 911

01:31:47.124 --> 01:31:48.112
They'll stop me

01:31:48.458 --> 01:31:49.116
Just call

01:31:58.723 --> 01:32:00.416
See

01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:01.385
What do you want?

01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:02.914
You ruined our boss,

01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:04.120
lost us our jobs

01:32:04.922 --> 01:32:06.411
We came for payback

01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:10.148
Mr. Chan

01:32:12.288 --> 01:32:13.844
I heard you're back in training

01:32:14.088 --> 01:32:14.644
Yes, I am

01:32:15.088 --> 01:32:15.815
Rematch?

01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:17.344
Mr. Lo sent you?

01:32:17.588 --> 01:32:18.554
Mr. Lo is broke

01:32:19.321 --> 01:32:20.582
It's not about money

01:32:22.354 --> 01:32:23.785
Not now

01:32:24.753 --> 01:32:25.878
You got no choice

01:32:29.819 --> 01:32:31.910
You really enjoy fighting, don't you?

01:32:33.385 --> 01:32:34.783
Only with the best

01:32:41.618 --> 01:32:44.708
What are they talking about?

01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:46.648
You never learned English...

01:32:46.817 --> 01:32:47.612
in school?

01:32:47.851 --> 01:32:48.714
C'mon, tell me

01:32:49.784 --> 01:32:50.306
No

01:32:54.482 --> 01:32:55.379
Okay

01:33:01.449 --> 01:33:02.210
Rules?

01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:03.278
No rules

01:33:05.515 --> 01:33:09.140
Anything goes, but no dirty tricks

01:33:17.713 --> 01:33:18.940
You like white

01:33:29.378 --> 01:33:30.207
Are you sure?

01:33:31.911 --> 01:33:32.774
I'm sure

01:34:54.968 --> 01:34:55.797
Good training

01:35:50.928 --> 01:35:51.984
Wait

01:36:13.724 --> 01:36:14.712
Now what?

01:36:16.157 --> 01:36:18.146
"What's you okay?" In English?

01:36:18.623 --> 01:36:19.816
Are you okay?

01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:21.485
Are you okay?

01:36:23.889 --> 01:36:24.820
Okay

01:36:43.321 --> 01:36:44.116
Pretty good

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.415
I'm coming

01:37:53.145 --> 01:37:53.838
Ready?

01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:24.768
Come on

01:38:28.307 --> 01:38:30.739
Smile, don't worry

01:39:08.536 --> 01:39:09.433
Are you ready?

01:39:27.866 --> 01:39:29.764
Come on

01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:35.954
Don't worry, be happy

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:12.649
Let's dance

01:41:35.284 --> 01:41:35.977
Let's finish

01:42:57.173 --> 01:42:58.298
Get up

01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.437
On your feet

01:43:06.072 --> 01:43:07.060
You okay?

01:43:18.338 --> 01:43:19.099
Yes

01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:21.800
You won

01:43:22.137 --> 01:43:22.728
I lost

01:43:23.437 --> 01:43:23.993
Why?

01:43:24.836 --> 01:43:25.563
Pound for pound

01:43:25.736 --> 01:43:28.202
He'd have beaten me in no time

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:30.427
See if he's all right

01:43:33.868 --> 01:43:34.925
You smell turpentine?

01:43:35.302 --> 01:43:36.733
The boss is setting a fire

01:43:38.802 --> 01:43:40.028
Fantastic

01:43:40.834 --> 01:43:41.857
But we'll go to jail

01:43:42.034 --> 01:43:42.931
Prison!

01:43:44.034 --> 01:43:45.522
This is nuts

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:46.966
Watch it

01:43:47.833 --> 01:43:49.026
No sweat

01:43:49.733 --> 01:43:51.824
Hey, jail sucks, boss

01:43:53.633 --> 01:43:58.462
You checked there's nobody inside?

01:43:58.699 --> 01:43:59.824
Sure did

01:43:59.999 --> 01:44:01.056
Good

01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:04.393
Give this to dad

01:44:04.831 --> 01:44:06.694
Tell him I love him

01:44:07.631 --> 01:44:09.426
Give this to C.N.

01:44:09.664 --> 01:44:12.596
Tell him I hate him

01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:15.457
This is for the cops

01:44:15.964 --> 01:44:18.293
I'm claiming all responsibility

01:44:18.596 --> 01:44:20.528
Really?

01:44:20.696 --> 01:44:21.787
You're going to jail, not us?

01:44:25.929 --> 01:44:27.019
Me neither

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:30.225
Stand aside

01:44:32.095 --> 01:44:33.822
C.N. And I go down together

01:44:33.994 --> 01:44:35.620
Don't do it, boss

01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:38.450
My eyes hurt

01:44:39.493 --> 01:44:41.220
But so what?

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.787
I'm going to die anyway

01:44:44.226 --> 01:44:46.555
Bye, Mary

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:51.848
Calm down, LW

01:44:52.492 --> 01:44:55.946
It's all your fault

01:44:56.191 --> 01:44:57.248
You took it too far

01:44:57.625 --> 01:44:59.022
Dad kicked me off the Board

01:44:59.224 --> 01:45:01.281
I have nothing now

01:45:01.457 --> 01:45:02.582
I'm finished

01:45:03.657 --> 01:45:05.748
What about us, boss?

01:45:05.957 --> 01:45:07.150
Are we finished too?

01:45:07.656 --> 01:45:08.145
You're asking me?

01:45:08.324 --> 01:45:09.381
Yes

01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:11.212
Shut up

01:45:13.656 --> 01:45:14.951
Boss

01:45:16.689 --> 01:45:17.450
Okay now?

01:45:17.622 --> 01:45:18.451
Warmer still

01:45:19.655 --> 01:45:20.211
How's that?

01:45:20.522 --> 01:45:21.317
Just right

01:45:23.092 --> 01:45:23.989
Your eyes still hurt?

01:45:26.459 --> 01:45:27.550
Why be so nice to me?

01:45:27.892 --> 01:45:28.721
You wanted to ruin me

01:45:30.559 --> 01:45:31.217
Styrofoam's bad...

01:45:31.392 --> 01:45:33.414
for the environment

01:45:34.058 --> 01:45:35.853
It needs to be regulated

01:45:36.059 --> 01:45:38.819
That motivated my acquisition

01:45:39.224 --> 01:45:40.519
Let's be partners

01:45:40.824 --> 01:45:43.756
In recycling paper

01:45:45.257 --> 01:45:46.745
That's not like you

01:45:47.491 --> 01:45:48.922
Ever since grade school

01:45:49.257 --> 01:45:50.517
You've had to beat me

01:45:51.156 --> 01:45:52.850
In whatever we do

01:45:53.056 --> 01:45:55.113
You stole my girlfriends

01:45:55.656 --> 01:45:58.554
And then dumped them

01:45:58.723 --> 01:45:59.711
Never really loved them

01:46:00.423 --> 01:46:01.286
I hated you so

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:03.516
I hated you too

01:46:04.022 --> 01:46:05.578
Really? What for?

01:46:05.655 --> 01:46:06.643
For always laughing

01:46:07.255 --> 01:46:08.914
For being born so rich

01:46:09.988 --> 01:46:11.079
For your name

01:46:11.555 --> 01:46:13.645
Low Wow is a stupid name

01:46:15.122 --> 01:46:16.451
I hated you most

01:46:16.722 --> 01:46:18.914
For stealing my puppy love, Ann

01:46:20.235 --> 01:46:22.030
So it boils down to Ann

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.459
But she dumped me

01:46:28.967 --> 01:46:30.865
She married that...

01:46:31.034 --> 01:46:34.363
Andy Law Andy Law

01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:36.583
That nerd

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:38.551
So dull

01:46:42.819 --> 01:46:44.046
We fought for so many years

01:46:45.053 --> 01:46:47.109
But we each haven't committed

01:46:47.752 --> 01:46:49.513
To loving only one woman

01:46:49.918 --> 01:46:52.713
But what about Mary?

01:46:52.885 --> 01:46:53.942
She's nothing

01:46:54.384 --> 01:46:55.441
But you yelled "Bye Mary" just now

01:46:56.284 --> 01:46:57.772
Weren't you engaged?

01:46:57.851 --> 01:46:58.874
What happened?

01:47:01.051 --> 01:47:03.107
I copped out

01:47:06.150 --> 01:47:07.740
but she's one great dame

01:47:08.173 --> 01:47:12.036
We were so happy together

01:47:12.716 --> 01:47:15.681
Laughing all day long

01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:20.205
Wish I could turn the clock back

01:47:22.614 --> 01:47:25.546
But she moved overseas

01:47:26.914 --> 01:47:28.504
I lost track of her

01:47:31.247 --> 01:47:33.405
What's wrong?

01:47:36.113 --> 01:47:36.942
See you later

01:47:38.246 --> 01:47:41.643
Did I say something?

01:47:46.379 --> 01:47:47.174
Skipper

01:47:48.046 --> 01:47:48.943
Your Bu is back

01:47:49.312 --> 01:47:53.574
Yes, she is. Cheers

01:47:53.945 --> 01:47:57.536
Skipper, cheers

01:48:09.909 --> 01:48:10.738
What's that?

01:48:12.576 --> 01:48:13.633
Going to college?

01:48:14.975 --> 01:48:16.168
Considering it

01:48:19.409 --> 01:48:20.567
You've changed

01:48:22.141 --> 01:48:24.573
Love changes people

01:48:27.941 --> 01:48:29.304
Don't rush...

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.269
to forget him

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:36.003
Or it'll get worse

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.062
One day

01:48:38.673 --> 01:48:40.036
You take a shower

01:48:40.206 --> 01:48:40.864
Listen to music

01:48:41.606 --> 01:48:43.503
And suddenly remember him

01:48:44.505 --> 01:48:47.266
Then you've forgotten him

01:48:52.138 --> 01:48:54.069
You're pretty when you smile

01:48:57.970 --> 01:48:58.765
Bu

01:49:02.803 --> 01:49:03.530
Albert

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:05.032
Where have you been?

01:49:05.602 --> 01:49:07.465
I was so worried

01:49:12.368 --> 01:49:13.527
You're not...

01:49:13.901 --> 01:49:15.299
really my type

01:49:18.835 --> 01:49:21.062
I like older men

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.597
I'm older than you

01:49:24.834 --> 01:49:26.094
I mean here

01:49:27.099 --> 01:49:28.030
Here?

01:49:28.833 --> 01:49:30.458
If I were your girl

01:49:30.766 --> 01:49:32.595
We'd break up in 3 days, tops

01:49:36.465 --> 01:49:37.725
You'll get it

01:49:38.132 --> 01:49:38.893
I miss you so

01:49:39.299 --> 01:49:40.628
I was so worried about you

01:49:42.464 --> 01:49:44.191
This must be your mother

01:49:44.664 --> 01:49:45.323
This is...

01:49:45.697 --> 01:49:47.822
Albert, my pal

01:49:51.463 --> 01:49:54.553
Can you be my adopted brother?

01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:56.352
Good idea

01:49:56.696 --> 01:49:57.593
I'm the adopted mother?

01:49:58.696 --> 01:49:59.457
Wait

01:50:01.162 --> 01:50:02.593
Why not? Mom

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.694
Son

01:50:04.195 --> 01:50:04.661
Mom

01:50:05.361 --> 01:50:07.350
My Albert

01:50:07.528 --> 01:50:07.959
Mom

01:50:40.057 --> 01:50:41.148
Bu! Bu!

01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:42.149
I missed you

01:50:44.123 --> 01:50:45.453
You miss me?

01:50:51.255 --> 01:50:52.186
Come back

01:50:53.055 --> 01:50:53.783
Bu!

01:50:56.655 --> 01:50:57.484
Bu!

01:51:29.051 --> 01:51:29.948
Bu!

01:51:32.551 --> 01:51:33.209
Scram

01:51:33.917 --> 01:51:36.008
It's you who bullied my daughter

01:51:36.184 --> 01:51:36.945
No, I didn't

01:51:37.284 --> 01:51:38.147
You did too

01:51:38.817 --> 01:51:41.839
She used to laugh all the time

01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:44.909
Now she hardly smiles

01:51:45.283 --> 01:51:48.180
My heart aches for her

01:51:48.749 --> 01:51:51.237
What did you do to her?

01:51:51.815 --> 01:51:53.338
Nothing

01:51:53.614 --> 01:51:55.341
Then why is she like this?

01:51:55.948 --> 01:51:57.675
Please let me talk to her

01:51:57.914 --> 01:51:59.607
Just...

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.837
leave her alone

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.544
I don't speak Taiwanese

01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.541
He said leave her alone

01:52:06.712 --> 01:52:07.643
Beat it

01:52:11.046 --> 01:52:11.602
Bu!

01:52:13.345 --> 01:52:14.208
Bu!

01:52:14.845 --> 01:52:15.334
Get lost

01:52:15.512 --> 01:52:16.000
Bu

01:52:16.245 --> 01:52:16.710
Hit the road

01:52:18.145 --> 01:52:18.667
I...

01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:35.571
It's all right

01:52:46.008 --> 01:52:47.598
You bullied my niece

01:53:05.572 --> 01:53:06.196
Sir

01:53:17.604 --> 01:53:19.069
I'll just sit here

01:53:19.603 --> 01:53:21.069
Don't walk past me

01:53:22.236 --> 01:53:24.498
You dad's a cool dude

01:53:28.836 --> 01:53:31.358
Sir, you okay?

01:53:32.335 --> 01:53:33.232
Are you hurt?

01:53:33.602 --> 01:53:35.760
Leave us alone

01:53:36.635 --> 01:53:37.965
Just 5 seconds with her, okay?

01:53:38.134 --> 01:53:40.066
Waste of time

01:53:40.468 --> 01:53:41.728
Bu, I...

01:53:41.901 --> 01:53:43.060
Shut up

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.293
Bu!

01:53:47.567 --> 01:53:48.396
Shut up

01:53:49.799 --> 01:53:50.322
Bu!

01:53:50.632 --> 01:53:51.257
Shut up

01:53:52.666 --> 01:53:53.155
Bu!

01:53:55.032 --> 01:53:56.396
I'm warning you

01:53:57.065 --> 01:53:57.894
Either you kill me

01:53:58.865 --> 01:54:00.263
Or let me talk to her

01:54:04.598 --> 01:54:07.961
All right, come

01:54:09.464 --> 01:54:11.521
Speak up

01:54:13.896 --> 01:54:17.794
Now or never

01:54:18.162 --> 01:54:19.560
Don't disturb them

01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:20.956
I want to hear

01:54:28.095 --> 01:54:28.992
Why bother?

01:54:33.494 --> 01:54:35.050
You left these

01:54:37.394 --> 01:54:38.620
I have plenty

01:54:44.026 --> 01:54:45.924
I brought Chinese pot rice

01:54:47.592 --> 01:54:49.524
It's cold, but it's your favorite

01:54:53.325 --> 01:54:57.256
some old clothes and a pot of rice?

01:55:00.558 --> 01:55:02.114
There's more

01:55:11.789 --> 01:55:13.220
I put a note in each one

01:55:14.322 --> 01:55:15.379
Saying what?

01:55:16.456 --> 01:55:18.546
I love you, I miss you

01:55:19.155 --> 01:55:20.518
Never over 4 words

01:55:21.022 --> 01:55:22.351
took me hours

01:55:24.854 --> 01:55:26.286
Too much work

01:55:26.821 --> 01:55:28.480
Just put $1,000 in each

01:55:28.854 --> 01:55:29.979
And you have me

01:55:43.086 --> 01:55:45.415
So do you love me?

01:55:46.618 --> 01:55:47.379
I love you

01:55:49.185 --> 01:55:50.741
Since when?

01:55:51.718 --> 01:55:53.274
Since you stole my name-card

01:55:55.451 --> 01:55:57.212
What wish did you make...

01:55:57.384 --> 01:55:58.576
on the boat?

01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:02.738
It's already come true

01:56:06.716 --> 01:56:08.545
Why do you cry?

01:56:11.482 --> 01:56:12.448
Kiss her

01:56:13.449 --> 01:56:15.676
Kiss her

01:56:15.915 --> 01:56:17.847
I'll say it in Cantonese

01:56:18.581 --> 01:56:19.569
Kiss her

01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:29.741
You're...

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.238
Xiaojun

01:56:31.612 --> 01:56:33.271
Do I know you?

01:56:34.079 --> 01:56:35.443
I'm your neighbor

01:56:35.912 --> 01:56:37.741
Wow, fantastic!

01:56:38.145 --> 01:56:38.701
Why?

01:56:39.845 --> 01:56:40.833
Oh, weather is fine

01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:56.597
Look at them

01:57:11.008 --> 01:57:12.598
The women here are gorgeous

01:57:12.808 --> 01:57:13.239
I should have...

01:57:13.407 --> 01:57:14.100
Go to hell

01:57:14.674 --> 01:57:17.162
I want you to meet my dolphin

01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.129
Really?

01:57:18.406 --> 01:57:21.167
Bu! Bu!

01:57:21.406 --> 01:57:22.167
Wow!
