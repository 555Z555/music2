WEBVTT

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.490
How long until we reach the embassy?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.960
About twenty minutes, Sir.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.490
Wait...

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.910
The brakes...

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.220
Hey! Watch the road!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.010
The road!

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.020
Our diplomat died
in an accident in Ostania.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.430
But we believe this was an assassination
by the East's right-wing party extremists.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.050
They are planning a war against Westalis.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.130
We must prevent that
from happening at all costs...

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.400
Let's leave it to him.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.400
The most skilled of our agents...

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.720
"Twilight."

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.840
Here's the promised goods.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.070
The proof that Foreign Minister
actually wears a wig.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.170
Got the film too.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.580
Well done.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.470
I can bring him down with these now.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm counting on you again next time.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.630
Hey.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.010
Now, hand me the promised goods.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.620
Huh?! B-But I just...

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.420
They got me!

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.680
<i>Codename: Twilight.</i>

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.300
<i>The man was a spy.</i>

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.130
<i>In an era in which the nations of the world
were waging a fierce war of information,</i>

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.510
<i>he had lived
through that battlefield...</i>

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.830
<i>...all while using
a hundred different faces.</i>

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.320
And Papa just keeps
getting pissed the whole day

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.910
because his "wig pictures" got stolen!

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.080
I don't get him!
It so pisses me off too!

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.130
Are you listening, Robert?

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580
Hm? Oh, that's disastrous.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.480
Hey, Robert.
Why don't we...

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.160
Karen, let's break up.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.930
Huh?!

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.490
You never talk about anything smart.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.990
Huh?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.680
Adieu, girl.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.770
Hey, wait!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600
Robert!
You can't just... Robert!

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.370
<i>Sorry, Karen.</i>

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.610
<i>I have no use of you
and your father anymore.</i>

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.730
<i>And so ends my mask as Robert tonight.</i>

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.770
<i>Marriage? Ordinary happiness?</i>

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.690
<i>I already got rid of my attachment</i>

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.700
<i>to such things the day I became
a spy, along with my real identity.</i>

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.160
Meow~

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.570
<i>C Code...</i>

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.510
The train to Berlint will be
departing from Platform 5 shortly.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.250
<i>Good afternoon,</i>

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.740
<i>or good evening, Twilight.</i>

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.860
<i>Good job with your previous mission.</i>

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.510
<i>Thanks to that,
the Minister survived a close call,</i>

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.290
<i>which would benefit our country as well.</i>

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.560
<i>Now, onto your next mission.</i>

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.190
<i>Your target is the Chairman of
the National Unity Party, Donovan Desmond.</i>

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.030
<i>He is a dangerous threat to
peace between the East and West.</i>

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.400
<i>Your mission is to get close to
him and find out what he is up to.</i>

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.650
<i>And for that, you will get
married and have a child first.</i>

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.800
Come again?!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.680
<i>Desmond is a paranoid man
that rarely shows his face to the public.</i>

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.460
<i>The only time he does</i>

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.000
<i>is at the regular social gathering
at his son's prestigious school.</i>

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.660
<i>It is a social event where political
and business leaders will gather.</i>

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.390
<i>Have your child enroll into the
school and infiltrate the gathering.</i>

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.900
<i>Due to the looming deadline for enrollment,</i>

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.980
<i>you will only have a week until then.</i>

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.570
How the hell am I supposed
to have a child in a week?!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.260
Excuse me.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.130
<i>Operation Strix.</i>

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.550
<i>This operation is key to peace between
East and West, and ultimately the world.</i>

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.010
<i>You're all heroes in the shadows.</i>

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.090
<i>Your heroic actions
will never see the light of day.</i>

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.440
<i>You won't get any medal, let alone
mentions on the newspaper from them.</i>

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.590
<i>But nevertheless,</i>

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.850
<i>do not forget that they are the reason for
people to be able to live a "normal life."</i>

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.200
<i>Very well.</i>

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.380
<i>I've thrown away my name
and face to become Twilight.</i>

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.220
<i>I shall play the part as
a father with a child if I have to.</i>

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.120
<i>All to make a better world, that is.</i>

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.790
(Mission: 1 - Operation Strix)

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.800
This is a family-type room.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.430
Fully furnished with both
a heater and cooler, and also...

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.870
Um... Sir?

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.170
<i>No wiretaps here,
and I can secure an escape route as well.</i>

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.750
I'll have this one.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.500
As you wish, Mr. Forger.
This way for the paperwork, please.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.580
<i>Loid Forger.</i>

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.470
<i>Profession: a psychiatrist.</i>

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.590
<i>That's my new identity from today.</i>

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.810
<i>With a loving family and a happy home...</i>

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.330
A new house for the family, right, Sir?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.670
Is your child a boy or a girl?

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.250
Ah, about that...

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.540
I'm about to decide that from now.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.210
Huh?

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.280
<i>It's a total liability for a spy.</i>

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.470
Oh, you want to adopt a child?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.160
Yes.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.250
I was told that they do
adoptions at the orphanage here...

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.400
- Actually, my wife and Iâ€”
- Okay, okay.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400
Just pick whichever you like.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.370
Come on in.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.460
<i>What a poor environment.</i>

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.070
<i>But the shadier the establishment is,</i>

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.300
<i>the easier it is to falsify the backgrounds
of the children whose identities are vague.</i>

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.130
<i>I can figure out the rest of the
mission as long as I have a child.</i>

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.340
<i>I'd prefer to do everything by myself...</i>

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.190
<i>But even being Westalis' number one spy</i>

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.390
<i>doesn't allow me to disguise as a child.</i>

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.390
Um, I'm looking for a child who can
write and read, if that's okay with you...

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.900
Oh, if that's the case...

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.390
Hey, Anya.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.400
She's the smartest kid here.
A bit of a silent type, but a good kid.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.790
<i>And a weird, creepy kid too.</i>

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.210
<i>Just get adopted already, will you?</i>

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.490
Come on, introduce yourself.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.290
Um, excuse me...

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.290
<i>If I recall, the school age for
Eden Academy should be from six...</i>

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.130
<i>She's definitely still around four or five.</i>

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.790
Six!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.670
Hm?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.500
Six.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.800
So you're six?

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.980
<i>But her height...</i>

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.810
<i>A newspaper?</i>

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.390
<i>A crossword puzzle?</i>

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.000
<i>Isn't that a bit too much for a child?</i>

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.630
<i>Though to me,
it's still a child's play.</i>

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.680
<i>Vertical 1 is Homeostasis,
Horizontal 1 is Causal Closure.</i>

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.170
<i>Below those is Symplectomorphism.</i>

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.250
<i>She could solve those? For real?</i>

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.410
<i>Such formidable intelligence!</i>

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.280
<i>She'll surely pass the
entrance exam without a hitch.</i>

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.540
I'll take her.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.250
As for the paperwork...

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.590
I don't need that.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.320
Just take her already.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.150
<i>Done with having a child...
It went too smoothly, I'm actually worried.</i>

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.630
Are you okay with this?

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.280
<i>A spy... Mission...</i>

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.520
<i>So exciting!</i>

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.740
<i>The girl was a telepath.</i>

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.100
<i>Subject 007.</i>

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.130
<i>The girl could read a person's mind.</i>

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.590
<i>She was accidentally produced as a result
of an organisation's experiments,</i>

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.490
<i>but she later escaped the facility.</i>

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.240
<i>She moved from place to
place in search of custody.</i>

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.660
Look, girl.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.530
Anya.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.760
Look, Anya.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.030
You're my daughter from today,

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.000
but you will tell the people around you
that we've always been a family. Okay?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.650
Yep.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.170
Also, you will address me
as "Dear Father" from now.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.140
Father.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.980
Close enough.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.780
Oh, what a cute girl
you are! Hello!

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.520
I'm your new neighbour, Forger.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.180
I'm Anya. I've been Father's
daughter since a long time.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.330
Huh?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.560
<i>You don't have to say that.</i>

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.680
Come on, let's get inside.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.910
Anya's home?

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.590
Yeah.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.940
A TV!

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.060
Feel free to turn it on.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.200
The adventure anime, Spy Wars!

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.700
Anya loves this!

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.690
<i>Out of all things...</i>

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.040
A silenced pistol?!

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.070
So exciting...

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.750
<i>I need to gather the necessities first.</i>

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.660
<i>And make a fake ID for her too.</i>

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.210
I'm heading out for a bit.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.500
Be a good girl and watch the TV.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.730
Adventure!

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.840
It's not! I'm just doing groceries!

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.790
Anya wants a pistol
that doesn't make a sound!

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.350
If they sell one, okay?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.960
<i>The essence of espionage is to
simply act normal without standing out.</i>

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.850
<i>We must look as a normal
family from all angles...</i>

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.130
- Father, help me!

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.340
- And yet she stands out...
- Father, help me!

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.610
Come on now. You must hold hands
with your father, okay?

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.170
<i>With one hand occupied,</i>

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.340
<i>I can't be prepared for an enemy attack,
but I can't do much about this either.</i>

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.460
<i>Enemy?!</i>

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.010
What are you doing?

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.000
Hiding!

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.310
<i>Did I do something that
made her hide like that?</i>

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.010
<i>It's still to early to hold hands, I see.
So she hates me now?</i>

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.880
<i>This is bad.</i>

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.390
<i>I must maintain a positive relationship
with her until my mission is done.</i>

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.230
<i>I need to learn more
about this creature...</i>

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.600
<i>Basic diplomacy. Understanding
the target is the first step toward peace.</i>

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.390
<i>Understanding Anya
will lead to world peace?!</i>

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.240
Anya likes peanuts.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.380
But Anya hates carrots.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.440
Hm? Oh...

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.320
Anya loves crunchy bacon too!

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.460
Bakery doesn't equal crunchy bacon, kid.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.330
This one, please.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.710
You can't buy something
worth a Dalc with ten pents.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.310
<i>Is she actually not that smart?</i>

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.090
<i>That crossword thing was actually a fluke?</i>

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.190
<i>Maybe I should change her
to someone else...</i>

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.910
D-Don't leave me!

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.030
What's wrong with you?!

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.350
Anya was just bargaining!

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.960
<i>What should I do...</i>

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.230
I'll buy you some peanuts, so stop crying!

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.820
Peanuts!

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.160
Father... Anya's sleepy...

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.580
Can't walk...

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.910
Huh?

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.160
<i>This isn't working...
I just don't understand.</i>

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.910
<i>This irrational behaviour...</i>

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.000
<i>I could use a manual to decipher it.</i>

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.000
The basic of raising a child is trust.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.510
Accept them rather than scold them,
and have the same perspective as them.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.010
A child cannot express
their feelings through words well.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.630
We should take a hint.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.620
So I shouldn't interrogate a child?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.800
<i>Do the parents of the world</i>

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.520
<i>normally carry out such
difficult missions all the time?</i>

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.220
Develop their self-esteem for their future.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.130
By helping your children to learn
to think for themselves, one day...

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.880
<i>I'm returning her to the
orphanage after the mission, anyway.</i>

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.420
<i>That's just what she is to me.</i>

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.660
Noooo waaaay!

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.070
I hate studying!

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.630
I need to know how smart you are
in preparation for the exam.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.790
Anya doesn't have to study for the exam!

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.110
I can just read other people'sâ€”

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.140
<i>Minds...</i>

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.370
Are you planning to cheat?

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.820
Look, if you're not going
to that school, myâ€”

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.850
<i>My mission will fail.</i>

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.600
Forget it.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.320
I'm heading out.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.610
I'm not taking you with me today.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.210
At all.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.210
Stay put.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.700
Hey!

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.660
I told you to stay put!

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.670
You there! You thought
I wouldn't catch you there?!

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.090
You there!

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.300
You there!

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.760
<i>Father's so good at finding me...
This is fun!</i>

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.760
Hahahah! There's no
getting out for you now!

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.760
So that's why you're late?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.770
Ultimately, I had to put up
a barricade to lock her inside.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.520
I hope the neighbours
don't report you for abuse.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.110
I have no idea how
a kid's brains work.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.430
Their trying to get away with crying
about everything is also infuriating.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.820
It's their job to cry, Mr. Twilight.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.230
Anyway, here's the stuff you requested.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.870
Application form, examination voucher,
plus entrance exam questions.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.070
I had a hard time getting these, you know.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.520
Appreciate it, Franky.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.500
I'm sure it'll work out if she
just memorises the whole answers.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.240
Oh, yeah. About your kid, too.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.630
I've scoured her past records
that weren't in the orphanage.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.370
I couldn't find anything
related to her birth date.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.360
Age and biological parents also unknown.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.710
There wasn't much about her
aside from the past year,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.260
and she's been sent back
from the foster family four times.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.400
And she's changed orphanage twice too.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.300
Anya Williams, Anya Levski, Anya Rosche...

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.890
The kid changes names every season...
Like father, like daughter, huh?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.160
Come on, I jest.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.400
You're on a mission, right?

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.810
Even though she's your daughter,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.310
that unneeded affection
won't get you anywhere, pal.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.490
Thank you for the warning.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.280
Hey! Where's my payment?!

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.180
Sheesh...

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.000
I have no idea how a spy's brains work.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.020
<i>I'm bored...
A real spy is not like what I expected...</i>

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.840
<i>I want to steal a bomb...</i>

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.470
<i>I can't have her mess around with my
spy tools, so I'll just put a lock on them.</i>

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.980
<i>The combination is 6, 1...</i>

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.230
1, 0. Bomb, bomb~

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.490
Bomb, bomb~

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.250
Whoa!

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.990
A secret radio!

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.990
Secret, secret~

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.500
Boss! We've intercepted
a new transmission!

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.180
Is it the West's encryption?

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.130
No, it's unencrypted.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.770
Um... "Twilight is here."

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.450
Twilight is here?!

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.920
It's the same frequency that the West use!

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.250
Here it comes again!

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.390
"Catch me if you can."

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.600
Find out where it came from, now!

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.770
Phew...

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.820
Ah!

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.370
Now that you've found out that
I'm a spy, I'll have to remove you.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.940
If he finds out that I'm a telepath...

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.070
I'll have to get out too...

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.250
Anya.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.950
Do not tell anyone about your power.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.340
Now, it's studying time, Anya.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.290
Anya wants to draw...

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.930
No need to do such a childish thing.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.290
Your power must bring peace to the world.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.300
No time to cry, Anya.
Stop playing around and get to studying.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.990
I hope she's not making a mess inside...

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.890
Right. I have to move this out of the way.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.870
Hm?

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.040
Who are these guys?

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.570
Anya!

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.710
Anya!

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.550
<i>She's been kidnapped?</i>

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.980
<i>By one of them?</i>

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.010
<i>But for what?</i>

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.220
<i>I need to find her quick...</i>

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.350
<i>Calm down, Twilight.</i>

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.930
<i>From the looks of it,
they know that I'm a spy.</i>

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.870
<i>I need to hide right now,
or I'll be facing hell.</i>

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.200
<i>Anya...</i>

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.300
<i>There's still plenty of
children to replace her.</i>

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.950
<i>Back to square one...</i>

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.970
Who's this kid?

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.810
Could she be Twilight's...

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.040
We don't know.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.950
She was in the room where the
transmission was sent, so just in case...

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.250
<i>It's because of that radio!</i>

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.510
There was a barricade outside the room,
and apparently she locked herself in.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.540
Why would she?

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.460
Beats me.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.850
Oh, well.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.860
We can just take her hostage as leverage

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.000
to force Twilight to exchange her
for the Minister's wig pictures.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.970
Boss.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.350
Maybe we should give up
on uncovering the wig...

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.390
Transparency is critical in politics.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:55.690
A wig doesn't make for a good PR.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.800
<i>A pistol that doesn't make a sound...</i>

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.820
Besides, the Minister is a traitor
who secretly sides with the West.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.690
Those who defend a traitor
are traitors themselves.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.670
<i>Real bad guys...!</i>

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.120
Boss! Nguyen and the others
have come back from the house!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.500
We got the guy.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.760
Well done.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.250
He's not just some amateur...
He's the real deal.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.060
Get some rest in the back.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.640
Well, then, Twilight.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.470
Care to return those pictures
you've stolen?

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.440
Nguyen?!

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.730
What the heck?!
So that guy was...

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.010
The daughter's gone!

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.170
He got us good again!

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.280
<i>I've made a blunder.</i>

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.820
<i>I can't believe I took the risk
and infiltrated the enemy base...</i>

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.000
<i>I'm a failure as a spy.</i>

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.010
<i>Father!</i>

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.660
It's okay, I won't hurt you.
Don't cry.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.930
<i>This is why kids are so...</i>

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.570
<i>I see...</i>

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.110
<i>I think I know why I get pissed
of whenever I heard a child cry.</i>

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.040
<i>It reminds me of
when I was a child myself.</i>

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.480
<i>No one was there to save me.</i>

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.580
<i>All I could do was cry over the
loneliness and despair helplessly.</i>

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.290
<i>The past I thought I had
thrown away came back to haunt me...</i>

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.020
<i>Never mind that...</i>

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.800
Look, girl.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.720
Anya.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.440
Look, Anya.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.150
You see...

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.050
We're actually pros in playing tag.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.570
If we find someone talented in this game,
we just want to challenge them right away.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.840
<i>You're a liar, Father.</i>

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.280
Look.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.740
If you go straight
and then turn right over there,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.040
you'll find a police station there.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.720
And if you give this to
the police, you win.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.630
Okay?

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.050
<i>If the police get this message, she'll
be able to live in a better orphanage.</i>

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.810
<i>I'll just figure out another plan</i>

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.170
<i>- that doesn't involve children.</i>

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.960
- Father...
<i>- that doesn't involve children.</i>

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.700
All right, off you go now! Quick!

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.410
<i>I'm a failure as a spy?</i>

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.400
<i>No...</i>

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.770
<i>My biggest blunder was
that I involved her in all this.</i>

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.460
<i>Right...</i>

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.270
<i>A world without the cries of children...</i>

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.520
<i>That's what drove me</i>

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.880
<i>into being a spy.</i>

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.650
Don't let him get away!

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.770
When I get him, I'm
going to uncover his face toâ€”

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.100
A trap?! But how...

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.910
Wait, isn't this flouâ€” Argh!

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.190
T-Twilight!

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.410
Don't shoot!
You'll blow us up!

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:33.620
Whaâ€”

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.100
No way...

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.810
Turn around and I'll kill you.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.610
Twilight...!

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.040
Good afternoon, or good evening, Mr. Edgar.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.190
How's Karen doing?

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.440
How do you know my daughter?!

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.630
It's a spy's job to know about her.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.690
Also her height, weight, foot size,

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.000
favourite food, and the number
of moles on her body.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.110
Compared to you, she's quite a cutie.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.020
And so is her criminal history.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.480
Nonsense!
My daughter wouldn't haveâ€”

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.580
Edgar.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.560
I know you're very fond of your daughter.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.250
Look.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.510
If you wish for her
to have a peaceful life,

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.550
don't you ever get in my way again.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.430
If you understand,
then go home.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.500
Anya?

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.730
Father!

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.450
Father!

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.410
Why are you...
I mean, what are you doing outside?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.780
Uh, I just happened to
be shopping over there...

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.210
But looks like they went bankrupt!

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.380
<i>You're a big liar, Father.</i>

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.080
Anya played tag with
the misters over there.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.210
Really? Was it fun?

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.220
A little scary...

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.750
Anya wants to go home.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.560
To Father and Anya's home.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.920
Are you sure?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.790
Anya will cry if you leave Anya behind.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.230
<i>She's been sent back
from the foster family four times.</i>

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.060
<i>Anya Williams...</i>

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.570
<i>Anya Levski...</i>

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.240
<i>Anya Rosche...</i>

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.680
Okay, then.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.900
Let's go home now.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.050
But that apartment is dangerous,
so we're moving out.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.630
I found a venomous
snake yesterday there.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:30.750
I hate snakes...

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.660
<i>Father's a big liar,</i>

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.000
<i>but a cool one at that!</i>

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.830
Anya wants to live in a castle!

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.010
If they sell one, okay?

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.870
Once we've moved in to a new house,
you will study again.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:42.560
Geh!

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.860
You just have to memorise
the answers this time. Easy.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.960
All right. Begin exam!

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.680
Make me proud, Anya...

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.040
You can do it.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.300
<i>My head hurts...</i>

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.130
<i>I don't get it at all...</i>

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.590
<i>Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...</i>

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.330
K-212... K-212...

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.250
Found it! You passed!

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.560
Great job!

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.680
Is Anya amazing?!

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.030
Super amazing!

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.530
Ah, Father!

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.370
<i>I feel so relaxed, my body
has given in to the piled up fatigue</i>

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.110
- Don't leave me!
<i>- from the past few days...</i>

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.800
- Father, Anya is crying now!
<i>- Relaxed?</i>

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.200
- Father, Anya is crying now!
<i>- Me?</i>

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.170
- Anya will be a good girl, so come back!
<i>- There's something wrong with me...</i>

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.250
<i>Fighting with each other
'til almost everything was in ruins</i>

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.470
<i>On this mischievous planet</i>

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:06.160
<i>I've been an outsider
since the day I was born</i>

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.020
<i>My tears have run dry</i>

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.350
<i>The place I'm going back to is in my dreams</i>

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.380
<i>I met you where I came spilling out</i>

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.430
<i>You with all your secrets</i>

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:27.940
<i>Pretending to be normal</i>

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.710
<i>I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong</i>

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:39.720
<i>Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along</i>

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.310
<i>We made a deal that day</i>

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.330
<i>Thicker than blood</i>

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:50.020
<i>A pact from heart to heart</i>

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.000
- Father has died...
<i>- Shall we hold hands and head home?</i>

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.910
<i>- Shall we hold hands and head home?</i>

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.160
- Mail's here!
<i>- Shall we hold hands and head home?</i>

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.120
- Mail's here!
<i>- What should we eat tonight?</i>

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.880
<i>- What should we eat tonight?</i>

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.470
<i>- "Here's what happened today"</i>

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.950
- Is this the Forger residence?
<i>- "Here's what happened today"</i>

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.620
- I'm Anya Forger.
<i>- "Here's what happened today"</i>

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.400
- I'm Anya Forger.
<i>- That's what I wanted to talk to you about</i>

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.190
- Give this to your dad or mum, okay?
<i>- That's what I wanted to talk to you about</i>

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.500
- I don't have a mother.
<i>- That's what I wanted to talk to you about</i>

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.590
- I don't have a mother.
<i>- Any and every day is</i>

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.040
- Oh... Sorry...
<i>- Any and every day is</i>

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.740
- Oh... Sorry...
<i>- A comedy with you</i>

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:06.800
- Father! The mailman came!
<i>- A comedy with you</i>

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.870
- Father! The mailman came!
<i>- Dancing on a creaking bed</i>

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.510
<i>- Dancing on a creaking bed</i>

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.460
<i>Rolling around in laughter</i>

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:20.280
<i>We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life</i>

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.040
What the hell?!
Are you trying to kill me?!

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.860
<i>I can't believe I fell asleep
in front of someone...</i>

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.510
<i>This is bad.
I need to pull myself together.</i>

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.170
Mail's here.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.120
It's a letter of invitation
from Eden Academy.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.530
What's wrong, Father?

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.430
The second screening will be
an interview with the parents.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.620
The participant must bring
both their parents to the school.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.060
No exceptions will be made.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.100
Anya doesn't have a mother!

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.160
