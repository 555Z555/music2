<i>In this world like nuts packed in a bag,</i>

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.880
<i>Everyone is snuggling up to
someone they meet</i>

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.010
<i>We are mixed in there and smiling</i>

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.360
<i>We can't be as we are,</i>

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.700
<i>Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table</i>

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.790
<i>Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?</i>

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.830
<i>Even though I chew up the real emotions,</i>

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.000
<i>They still don't disappear</i>

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.590
<i>They are still stuck in my teeth</i>

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.590
<i>My life is so insecure and drifting,</i>

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.800
<i>And I know</i>

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.220
<i>Every day is so mediocre,</i>

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
<i>but I'm here and so are you</i>

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.400
<i>Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy</i>

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.780
This won't do.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.100
Huh?!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.660
Anya doesn't want this mother.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.620
Looks like you're not cut out
to be a mother, Franky.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.630
I thought you could do
better with your magic fingers?!

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.800
There's only so much I could do
with your height and build.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.510
I went through all the trouble
to help you out, dang it!

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.010

<i>I never thought the presence of both parents
would be required for the interview...</i>

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.490
There's no other way.

Have you heard?
(Capital City Berlint - City Hall)

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.740
There was a burglar in our department.
(Capital City Berlint - City Hall)

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.290
And they only ransacked the shelves
with the women's personal information.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.420
Awful, isn't it?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.000
What a creepy guy.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.590
If anyone, it's Chief who's creepy.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.340
He was looking at me with
such lewd eyes this morning.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.800
You're wearing a short skirt, that's why.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.680
But this skirt is the
source of my boyfriend's smile!

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.730
You've got a good style too,
so why don't you do the same, Sharon?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.730
I already have a child, so I can't.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.110
What do you think about this, Yor?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.270
Isn't the culprit a creep?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.940
Yes?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.110
Is that for Chief?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.490
Let's put a booger in it!

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.450
Huh?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.330
Will the coffee taste better
if we put a booger in it?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.540
Yor, you're just so...

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.210
Unique, I guess.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.290
I feel you!

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.000
She's so out of this world,
no guys would ever approach her!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.170
Now, Millie...

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170
You already look good the way you are.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.090
With a little bit of touch-up,
I bet you'll be the talk of the town!

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.800
Sure...

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.930
I'll give you the list of my
recommended cosmetics next time!

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.180
As long as I can continue working,
I don't really need such things.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.100
But you're already 27, right?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.230
Gotta be careful with that, you know?

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.690
I mean, hasn't there been a lot
of spies roaming around here?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.240
So people have been reporting
others for something trivial.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.530
The other day,
a woman in her 30s living alone

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.700
was reported by her neighbours
for "being suspicious."

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.290
What the heck!
That's just hilarious!

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.500
You're quite the informant, eh, Camilla!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.080
Well, I suppose being a single
at that age is already a problem.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.420
Pretty fishy indeed.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.300
I suppose so...

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.510
Thank you for the warning.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.430
Oh, right!

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.180
We're having a party
at my house this weekend.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.510
Please come as well if you like, Yor.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.520
With your partner, of course.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.690
Aren't you raising the bar
too high for her?

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.400
Maybe the burglar would
be lured in with her.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.400
You're a meanie!

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.780
This is Briar speaking.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.410
<i>How are you, Sis?</i>

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.910
Yuri!

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.540
<i>How's work?</i>

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.000
All good.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.790
I'm still working hard.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.790
<i>You're kind of a weird one,
so I'm worried about you.</i>

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.880
I'm perfectly normal, mind you!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.090
<i>Isn't it about time you got married?</i>

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.300
<i>Found a nice guy yet?</i>

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.800
<i>That again...</i>

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.760
<i>Actually, I'm about to be promoted...</i>

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.100
<i>And I'm going to be jumping
from place to place even more.</i>

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.100
<i>But I can't just leave you like this,</i>

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.770
<i>so I'm wondering
whether I should accept it.</i>

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.010
<i>I am who I am now thanks to you.</i>

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.030
<i>So I just want you to
be happy for your sake.</i>

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.410
I know.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.030
Thank you, Yuri.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.120
<i>I'll introduce you to someone,
if you'd like.</i>

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.700
Huh? Oh, you don't have to!

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.000
Actually, I'm going to
a party this weekend!

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.500
Of course, with a partner...

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.110
<i>Huh? You have a boyfriend?</i>

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.710
Y-Yeah!

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.420
So don't worry about me.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.630
<i>Oh, wow! That's great!</i>

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.430
<i>And the host is someone from work?</i>

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.010
Yeah, it's Camilla.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.590
Oh!

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.100
<i>I'll just ask Mr. Dominic later</i>

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.220
<i>about what kind of guy he is, then.</i>

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.970
Huh?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.520
<i>You're so gullible, after all.</i>

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.900
<i>I can't have you date a scumbag, can I?</i>

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.480
Huh? Um...

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.690
<i>I'll put my promotion on hold
until I know you're with a good guy.</i>

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.150
You don't have to...

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.320
<i>I'll look forward to it.</i>

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.010
<i>All right, then.
Good night.</i>

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.700
<i>What should I do...</i>

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.410
<i>I need to find someone by the weekend!</i>

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.000
<i>If he finds out that I'm lying,</i>

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.580
<i>he'll think of me as a "liar"
on top of a "weird person,"</i>

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.800
<i>and never believe me again!</i>

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.220
<i>I need to find a nice guy
for Yuri's promotion too...</i>

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.220
You got the wrong idea, Yuri!

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.350
That was a jok...

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.220
<i>Oh? It's so rare for you to
have a quarrel with your brother.</i>

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.230
"Shopkeeper"?

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.980
I'm sorry, I got the wrong person.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.020
<i>Good evening.</i>

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.980
<i>We have a guest waiting for
you, Thorn Princess.</i>

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.690
<i>Royal Hotel.</i>

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.610
<i>Room 1307.</i>

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.990
I'm sorry, Lady.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.710
This floor is currently
reserved for private use.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.620
Did someone order a girl?

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.000
Dunno.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.420
Um, but I've heard...

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.800
...that a traitorous
scumbag is staying here.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.220
What's happening?!

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.100
An intruder!

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.010
That woman has...

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.230
Um...

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.110
You are Vice Minister Brennan
from the Auditing Department, right?

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.230
I'm sorry to have bothered you...

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.240
But could I choke the life
out your body, Mister?

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.240
<i>Codename: Thorn Princess.</i>

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.620
<i>The woman was an assassin.</i>

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.330
<i>Trained in the art of killing
from an early age,</i>

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.000
<i>she continued doing some dirty
work as per her employer's orders.</i>

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.010
It's not coming off...

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.720
No way!

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.680
What should I do...

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.220
This is the only formal wear I have...

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.520
I can't go to the party...

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.400
<i>Found a nice guy yet?</i>

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.900
<i>I suppose being a single
at that age is already a problem.</i>

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.570
<i>With your partner, of course.</i>

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.010
I can't...

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.490
All I can do for housework...

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.490
...is just cleaning...

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.330
Curly guy!

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.790
There!

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.830
I've copied all the files on all
the single women from the city hall.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.080
Appreciate it.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.830
Someone who's fine with a widower,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.800
has the perfect aura to be
in a prestigious school,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.510
and is able to join in for the
paperwork signing within 48 hours?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.010
Boy, I'd kill for such a goddess!

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.810
I can't even be particular about
my preferences, let alone going on a date!

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:14.810
What a pity...

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.270
Don't you take pity on me!

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.310
A child makes you unpopular?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.310
Is Anya just a bother?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.900
You're not.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.010
Don't worry about me, just go watch TV.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.780
Yep.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.540
Why can't you just use a female
agent from your office for this?

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.950
<i>- Hey! Snap out of it!</i>
- A lot of them were taken down

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.420
<i>- Hey! Snap out of it!</i>
- from the spy hunting going on.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.580
<i>- How could you...</i>
- So there's none left.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.830
<i>- How could you do this to my friends?!</i>
- Well, everyone's trying

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.340
<i>- How could you do this to my friends?!</i>
- to be a snitch nowadays.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.800
We're too understaffed,
hence even I was given a new mission.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.510
Apparently, I have to "destroy
a certain smuggling syndicate."

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.300
Bro, that's a black
business you're working at!

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.700
Oh, well.
Let's just get this over with.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.260
We'll just find someone

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.730
with special circumstances
and mutual interests to be quick.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.400
She's got to have
a weakness or two as well.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.360
If she doesn't,
we can just make one up.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.690
I want to avoid any
unnecessary risks, if possible.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.110
What are you talking about?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.860
That thing is already enough risk for you.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.200
She really doesn't look like the
daughter of a proper family.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.780
I suppose so.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.370
I need to at least do
something with her looks...

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.750
I'll measure your size, then.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.380
Come this way, Miss.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.710
Anya's going to be sold?!

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.840
If you behave well, I won't sell you.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.680
Good grief...
Where did she learn to say that?

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.520
<i>The seamstress... is already married.</i>

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.400
<i>As for the owner... she was
in the list of single women earlier,</i>

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.820
<i>but she has been arrested
once before for political campaigning,</i>

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.360
<i>so the risk is quite high.</i>

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.360
<i>It's not so easy to get things
right with favourable conditions, huh.</i>

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.330
Excuse me!

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.120
Oh, long time no see, Yor.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.200
Hello.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.910
I'd like to commission
a fix for my dress...

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.500
Could you do it quickly?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.670
Of course! You've been
our loyal customer, after all!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.590
<i>Did she just casually
sneak up behind me?</i>

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.920
<i>Just whoever is she?</i>

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.300
<i>Yor... Yor...</i>

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.800
<i>There it is.</i>

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.010
<i>Yor Briar, 27.</i>

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.890
<i>No record of marriage.</i>

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.600
<i>Both her parents have passed away,</i>

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.020
<i>and she has a brother
much younger than her.</i>

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.020
<i>Both of them are public servants,
and have a clean record so far.</i>

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.400
<i>Just an oversight on my part, huh?</i>

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.190
<i>I've been so relaxed lately...</i>

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.900
Um...

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.400
You've been staring at me earlier...

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.110
Do you need something?

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.410
- Ah... Um...
<i>- No way!</i>

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.120
- Ah... Um...
<i>- She could tell that I was staring at her?!</i>

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.410
- I'm sorry...
<i>- She could tell that I was staring at her?!</i>

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.600
I just thought that you're so pretty...

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.660
So...

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.710
Are you saying you have a positive
impression of my appearance?

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.710
Hm? Well, yeah...

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.250
<i>You already look
good the way you are.</i>

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.920
<i>I bet you'll be the talk of the town!</i>

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.010
Um...

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.510
Father! She measured
Anya's height just now!

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.300
Who's that?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.470
Just another customer.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.930
<i>He's a father...</i>

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.400
<i>I was this close to inviting
someone's husband...</i>

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.320
<i>I heard someone who does that
gets killed by the wife...</i>

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.690
<i>Well, I can just kill her back, though.</i>

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.990
Huh?!

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.070
<i>This is bad!</i>

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.410
<i>I mustn't have these thoughts, or someone
will find out that I'm an assassin!</i>

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.910
<i>I need to act more normally...</i>

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.000
<i>A-An assassin?!</i>

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.620
<i>A spy...
An assassin...</i>

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.130
<i>This is...</i>

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.210
<i>...so exciting!</i>

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.630
<i>She was hungry for entertainment.</i>

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.920
<i>Hmm...</i>

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.010
<i>I thought I'd take her as a bride
for the mission, but I changed my mind.</i>

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.800
<i>Huh?!</i>

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.390
<i>I thought I'd bring him to
the party as my boyfriend...</i>

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.510
<i>But it'd end up
as a warzone, so I can't...</i>

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.600
Ah... Anya doesn't have
a mother, it's so lonely~

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.900
What are you doing,
out of the blue?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.900
I long for the existence of a mother...

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.010
Your wife isn't with you now?

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.610
Ah, well...

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.010
My wife passed away two years ago...

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.870
I'm raising her as a single father now.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.410
<i>No one would kill me if I invited him...!</i>

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.960
Um...

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.460
A pretend boyfriend?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.010
Yes...

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.380
I lied to my brother
that I had a boyfriend...

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.470
So I was wondering if you'd come with
me to the party if you're okay with it...

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.600
But I don't have any weird
ulterior motives or anything at all!

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.440
I'll pay you back, of course.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.000
I just... want to reassure
my brother, that's all.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.900
All right, then.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.030
It's a deal.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.030
Really?!

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.530
But in exchange...

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.710
Therefore, I'd like you to pose as the mother
for my daughter's interview at school.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.000
Mother?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
In these uncertain times,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.800
I really want my daughter
to get into a good school...

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.800
It's also what my late
wife wanted as well!

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.390
<i>You're a liar, Father.</i>

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.680
<i>What a good person!</i>

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.600
<i>- I'll have her comply</i>

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.280
- It's only a one-time thing,
<i>- I'll have her comply</i>

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.000
- It's only a one-time thing,
<i>- with a small request first.</i>

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.430
- so will you help me?
<i>- with a small request first.</i>

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.100
- so will you help me?
<i>- Then, ultimately,</i>

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.810
- O-Okay.
<i>- I'll have her</i>

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.210
- O-Okay.
<i>- comply with an official marriage.</i>

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.020
Let me know if there's
anything I can help with!

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400
Thank you.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.690
I'll see you at the party
next Saturday, then.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.190
Okay.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.490
I've called a babysitter
to look after you this weekend,

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.300
so don't go cause any trouble, okay?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.990
Big need for more peanuts!

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.700
Okay, okay.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.210
Here's your 10 pent change, ribbit.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.290
Come again, ribbit.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.290
Ribbit?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<i>T Code... No...</i>

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.210
<i>F Code, huh...</i>

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.720
<i>Details for an extra mission...</i>

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.470
<i>Recover the art works stolen from the East,</i>

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.690
<i>and destroy the smuggling
syndicate stealing them.</i>

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.730
<i>Execute the mission when they meet
with the buyer on Saturday at 18:00...</i>

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.690
Saturday?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.010
With that being said...

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.700
We must get this over with quickly
so that I can make it to the party.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.700
Help me out.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.620
Hold on a sec!

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.950
I'm just an informant, Bro!
I'm no fighter!

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.290
You owe me a lot for my services, too!

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.420
The 78 stolen goods are worth
3 million dalc in total.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.380
No one would notice if
they're missing one or two.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.380
Leave it to me!

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.890
I've invented new spy items
for a rainy day like this!

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.100
<i>What a handy bloke.</i>

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.100
He sure is late...

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.000
I hope he doesn't get
involved in an accident...

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.240
Hold it right there!

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.110
Who sent you here?!

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.010
Bro, I didn't know they got
the whole army in there!

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.950
2, 4, 6... There's 38 of them.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.210
I must deal with each one
no longer than ten seconds!

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.510
They got backup?!

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.420
They just keep coming!

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.300
They're all inside the van! Get in!

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.000
Sheesh!

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Which one should I stash now~

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.900
I'll take this one.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.900
Wow, a diamond ring!

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.730
You can't pick the
most expensive one, Bro!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.190
I'm using this for that mission.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.820
Shut up! Give it to me!

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.090
<i>Oh, I get it...</i>

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.710
<i>So this is how it feels
to be toyed with...</i>

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.510
<i>But for my brother's sake...</i>

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.300
<i>I must maintain a good relationship
with my co-workers...</i>

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.890
<i>So I can't afford to be
absent from the party.</i>

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.690
You're late, Yor!

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.000
Excuse me.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.690
Here's a gift for you.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.900
Huh? I thought you'd be
coming with your boyfriend?

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.530
He said he had some urgent business.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.700
Now that's a bummer!
I'd like to see him, though!

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.700
Wow, what a lame reason.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.080
That's just too sad!

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.460
I'm sure she's lying
about having a boyfriend.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.170
Should we report the liar?

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.080
Yeah!

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.300
She's gotta be a spy sent to lower
the birth rate of our country!

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.220
Now that's just stupid.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.220
I'm sure she's just unpopular.
Just leave her alone.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.680
Man, I was really looking forward
to meeting your boyfriend, though.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.600
M-Mr. Dominic!

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.810
Yuri's always worried about you.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.520
Um... Could you tell him...

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.740
That I brought a nice guy here?

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.700
Oh, that's not happening, Yor!

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.820
Do you really want to look so good
in front of your brother?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.120
You'll just end up looking
more miserable, you know!

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.490
Hey, stop it, Camilla!

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.660
<i>Don't you talk with someone else's man!</i>

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.130
I'll tell your brother that
you actually came here alone.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.380
<i>What would she be gaining
from doing all this...?</i>

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.590
<i>This is starting to be a pain...</i>

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.800
<i>If I killed every single adult here...</i>

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.890
<i>No one would say
anything to my brother...</i>

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.220
Sorry about this!

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.770
Just enjoy the party!

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.390
Come on, Camilla!
Help me with cooking the gratin!

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.900
So the guy...

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.780
Mama!

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.700
My eldest son is taking
the entrance exam today.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.030
For the elite Eden Academy.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.490
Oh, wow!

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:42.620
- Through the elite way, huh!
<i>- That must be... the "normal" life...</i>

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.590
<i>Surely my brother has always
wanted me to live such a life...</i>

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.090
Hey, how come she's still here?

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.880
She's got quite
the ironclad will, huh?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.590
If anything, it's already amazing
that she could come here alone.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.600
<i>Oh, I get it...</i>

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.680
<i>It seems I'm just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.600
Excuse me.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.360
I'll take my lea...

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.010
I'm sorry for coming late.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.490
I'm Loid Forger, Yor's husband.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.330
Um... You're not my husband,
but my boyfriend...

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.500
Oh, shoot!

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.370
<i>I got it mixed up with my mission...</i>

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.210
Um, Mr. Forger? You're bleeding...

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:26.500
Oh, excuse me.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.210
The patient got a bit out of control...

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.220
It's a common occurrence
within the world of psychiatrist.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.590
Are you having fun, Yor?

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.050
No way...

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.720
You're already married, Yor?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.310
Why didn't you tell me?

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.020
Um... Well...

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.600
I'm ashamed to admit it,
but I'm a widower with a child,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.690
so I guess she's just
being considerate of me.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.310
- It's all my fault.
<i>- I won't believe it!</i>

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.360
<i>There's no way Yor could have
a smart and handsome man like him!</i>

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.360
<i>I'm really going to put her to shame!</i>

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.910
Here, have some hot gratin,
fresh from the oven!

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.530
Oh, no! I tripped!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.400
It's good that you're
not letting food go to waste,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.420
but don't use your leg, Yor.
It's indecent.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.050
Ah, I'm sorry!

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.090
That's your concern...?

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.800
Hmm, this is quite the taste.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.050
Yes!

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.310
Mr. Ranger, did you know?

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.220
It's Forger.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:27.060
She used to do some naughty work
before working at the city hall!

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.000
- What was it, again?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.020
- Stop it!
- What was it, again?

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.030
You used to be called to a hotel and
give a sexy massage to some guys, right?

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.320
So lewd!

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.990
That's...

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.490
<i>It's a "massage" to death since
they're my targets, actually...</i>

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.780
It's not what you think, Loid.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.200
I...

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.290
That's wonderful.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.000
Huh?

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.830
Yor's parents died at an early age.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.340
Since then, she has struggled to
provide for her young brother.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.760
Even sacrificing her own life...

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.300
For someone...

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.300
To work a harsh job for something,
and for someone else...

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.510
It would require an ironclad will.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.310
That is something she
should be proud of.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.730
Shall we go home now, Yor?

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.020
Okay...

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.320
Thank you for tonight, everyone.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.400
S-Sorry for the husband
thing back there.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.490
Ah, it's okay...

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.830
What should we do if your
brother caught wind of this...

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.580
Um... If you don't mind...

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.550
Huh?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.050
<i>The remnants of the syndicate earlier?</i>

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:38.630
Hang on to something, Yor!

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.550
Huh?

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.310
<i>How could they find out...</i>

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.690
<i>Don't tell me there's a
transmitter in the goods?!</i>

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.060
<i>You really are getting soft, Twilight!</i>

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.690
Who are those people?

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.610
<i>Um... Uh...</i>

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.990
L-Looks like the patient's
hysteria still hasn't subsided yet...

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.330
It must be tough being a doctor.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.620
<i>She bought that?!</i>

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.370
Anyhow, let's get out of here first.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.380
They've abandoned the van.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.210
They must be hiding somewhere.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.710
Spread out and find them.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.720
This way, hurry!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.390
Um... Is it really okay to hit a patient?

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.730
Um, that's...

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.020
In recent years,
the medical community...

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.400
...has been using the cutting-edge
"batting therapy" method...

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.810
Huh...

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:35.730
(He made that one up.)
Huh...

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.240
<i>She's so sharp, yet so dense...
I don't understand.</i>

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.990
Look out, Yor!

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.200
<i>Another one?!</i>

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.490
I can't dodge him!

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.000
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.500
I administered the therapy
despite being an amateur...

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.210
I'm actually good at self-defense...

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.130
I learned it from my brother, so...

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.130
Thank you, Yor.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.800
You're so amazing!

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.510
You sent him flying!

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:11.520
I'm sorry for sending him flying.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.600
There they are!

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.020
Do whatever it takes and kill them all!

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800
Um... Loid...

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.330
I know it's not the right time for this...

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.120
But why don't we get married?

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:37.340
Huh?!

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.840
I mean... I'm just extending our terms...

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:47.720
Um... A single woman like me
is already considered suspicious as it is...

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.850
So for camouflage...

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.390
<i>And for me to
continue being an assassin...</i>

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.850
Um, so...

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.980
If you'd like,
why don't we stay together...

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.860
...even after that one interview?

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.860
For our mutual benefits...

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.990
<i>The only one that would accept me now...</i>

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.870
<i>...must be no other than him!</i>

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.790
We should drop by the city hall for
the paperwork on our way home, then.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.130
Right now?!

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.630
We should strike
while the iron is hot.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.000
Oh, right.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.340
Where did I drop it?

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.220
You bastards!

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.390
We've got them cornered!

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.020
Kill them all!

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.600
Yor.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.810
In sickness...

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.610
And in sorrow...

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.110
No matter what kind
of trouble awaits us...

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.240
Let's help each other.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.120
Yes.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120
<i>As long as I...</i>

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.120
<i>As long as I...</i>

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.000
<i>- Can continue my mission...
- Can continue being an assassin...</i>

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.930
(Mission: 3 - Prepare for the Entrance Exam)
