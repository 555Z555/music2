00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:58.858
TONG'S RESIDENCE

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:04.691
What's going on?

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.025
I've waited for six hours,
why hasn't he come out yet?

00:02:08.358 --> 00:02:11.566
Usually, he will come out
after four hours.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:13.941
-Put the rubbish in front of the door.
-Yes.

00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:19.941
-Let's fight for it.
-I saw it first.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.608
Great!

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.483
I have the painting of Tong Pak-fu.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.941
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:32.400
It's mine.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:00.758
-Master, isn't one dish of soy enough?
-Slowly, please.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:03.675
Many people came for your paintings.
Why don't you bother?

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.550
I am in no mood to draw.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:07.216
Just give them two more
baskets of rubbish.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
Yes, Master.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:10.383
Mr. Chuck.

00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:11.601
Mr. Tong.

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:12.810
Mr. Chuck.

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:14.700
Help, Mr. Tong.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:18.716
I think you must have lost
all your money again.

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:22.555
You understand me so well.

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.466
Everyone knows

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.633
you love gambling the most
among the Four Scholars.

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:31.216
"Having no money to live comfortably."

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:33.679
That is your motto, right?

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:34.800
You are flattering me!

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:36.800
It's nothing compared to
your wild and unruly behavior.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.508
In fact, you are much luckier than me.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.050
But you lose so much money every two days,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.133
and you come to seek help from me
after losing money.

00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.300
I don't think I can help you forever.

00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:49.883
Sure!

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:52.258
Because of that,
I tried to risk it for the last time.

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.466
But I lost all the money
I could lose until my death

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:56.300
which are 300,000 taels.

00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:58.758
So I need you to draw 30 pictures

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.883
-to save my life.
-Understood.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:02.883
Shui, go out first.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.175
Yes, Master.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:07.841
Damn you, do you think I owe you that?

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.425
You need 30 pictures? No way!

00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:13.675
Please! It's my fault.

00:04:13.758 --> 00:04:15.008
I am now begging you to forgive me.

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:17.841
You should remember that I lent you
the porn magazine when you were a child!

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.550
Also, I always helped you
sell your paintings and made you rich!

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:22.258
Some loan sharks
are waiting for me outside.

00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.216
They want me to get 30 paintings
of yours in 1 hour.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.091
Otherwise, they'll kill me!
Will you help me or not?

00:04:26.175 --> 00:04:27.175
One hour?

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:31.300
Well, since you are my buddy,
I will write a lament for your funeral.

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:33.216
"A bastard" or "A scumbag",
which one do you like?

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.341
Choose between these two.

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:37.258
Pak-fu, don't be that mean to me.

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:38.591
I swear.

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:39.966
If I gamble again,

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:42.675
I will be terribly assaulted
by an ugly woman until death.

00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:44.716
Or until my penis becomes rotten.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:45.758
Is it okay?

00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:49.050
You made such a terrible oath!

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.341
Okay, I will save you for the last time.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.133
Men, give me the stationery.

00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:00.050
You are such a heroic friend,
how righteous!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.383
Cut the crap and undress.

00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:02.841
Undress?

00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.883
What are you doing?

00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:31.341
You can do this too?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.258
TONG YAN

00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:44.175
Fantastic!

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:45.841
It's worth being tortured!

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:46.925
What is it called?

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:50.925
It's great! It's called <i>Great Eagle</i>.

00:06:51.216 --> 00:06:53.091
It's worth over 300,000 taels.

00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:54.425
Don't bother me again.

00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:57.466
Sure, but you amazed me.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.716
You used my nipples to paint the flowers.

00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.508
You used my palms to paint the trees.

00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:03.008
My ass is used to paint the stones.

00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:05.300
Clouds and mountains are drawn
with my feet.

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.050
As for the eagle,

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.633
which part of my body is used?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.425
It's your penis.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.591
I guessed it correctly.

00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:15.841
It's so vivid! How wonderful!

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:18.716
Your penis is used to paint
the little worm in the eagle's mouth.

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.925
How wonderful can it be?

00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:24.466
That's good.

00:07:24.883 --> 00:07:26.091
It's useful anyway.

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:29.800
<i>Tong Pak-fu was born
during the Ming Dynasty,</i>

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.716
<i>in the Year of the Tiger.</i>

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.883
<i>He was named Tong Yan.</i>

00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:37.091
<i>"Yan" means tiger in Chinese,
so he was named Pak-fu or First Tiger.</i>

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:40.091
<i>He was very clever, and was good
at writing poems and painting.</i>

00:07:40.216 --> 00:07:42.633
<i>He was the leading scholar
of the Four Scholars in Ming Dynasty.</i>

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:45.508
<i>Tong Yan was the idol of many people.</i>

00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:47.716
<i>He was envied by many men</i>

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:52.133
<i>because he had eight pretty wives.</i>

00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:55.633
<i>He seemed to be
the luckiest guy in the world!</i>

00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:58.866
Hands up! Do you have money?

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.116
Please lend it to me first.

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.283
Are you kidding? You are so poor!

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:04.158
Pay me now.

00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:05.866
I have money. I can keep on playing.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.783
Pay me now.

00:08:06.866 --> 00:08:08.575
You always win.
I wonder if you are a swindler.

00:08:08.658 --> 00:08:12.116
Of course! I'm so lucky!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.283
Dear, come and eat the chicken wings!

00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.158
Why are you late?

00:08:17.283 --> 00:08:18.783
Hey, are you ready?

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.491
We're ready.

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:23.491
My <i>Hundred Flowers</i>!

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.991
Don't be so mean. We're just using it
as a temporary tablecloth.

00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:29.741
You are not dying, so you can draw
another one anytime you like.

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:32.200
-But--
-Cut the crap, play with me.

00:08:32.283 --> 00:08:33.908
Fortune, make it three. Why not thirty?

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:35.033
Drink it!

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:37.575
-Hurry up!
-Let's start!

00:08:37.658 --> 00:08:38.575
Are you ready?

00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:41.366
<i>TONG YAN'S POETRY</i>

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.408
Gosh. What are you doing?

00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:45.408
My poetry!

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:47.658
Look at this. The table is not balanced.

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.283
One book is not enough.
Bring me two more, please.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.033
My first part is seven and eight, I win!

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.575
My second part is two and five, I win!

00:08:54.658 --> 00:08:55.825
Again?

00:08:57.325 --> 00:09:00.408
Why is a bird missing from my painting?

00:09:00.616 --> 00:09:02.950
Cut the crap!
I lost a bird from my mahjong tile.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.950
So I cut out the head to replace it.

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.408
You shouldn't be surprised!

00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:09.366
You...

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.825
Mother, what are you doing?

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:17.408
I want to commit suicide!

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.116
Go and take a look at her now.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.408
Hold it, let's finish this first.

00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:22.241
Watch me, I am the winner.

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.658
You jinx!

00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:25.116
Money, please.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:27.408
Mother, are you crazy?

00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:29.366
I am useless.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.241
I've married you to eight wives,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.033
but you aren't satisfied.

00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:35.700
You always have a long face.

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:38.325
I think I have to kill myself
because I am ashamed!

00:09:38.408 --> 00:09:40.158
Why do you say so?

00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:42.116
I've never blamed you!

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.283
Pak-fu.

00:09:43.908 --> 00:09:47.325
You are young and successful.

00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.991
You are rich and you have so many wives.

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:54.241
You should be
the happiest guy in the world.

00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:56.533
I never said I was unhappy.

00:09:56.783 --> 00:09:58.950
Then why the long face?

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.450
Is it because you think
they don't deserve you?

00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:03.325
It's easy to get a wife,

00:10:03.491 --> 00:10:05.783
but it's not easy to get
a wife who understands me.

00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:08.033
Although they are my wives,

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.450
they don't really understand my mind.

00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:17.283
You don't like us?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.325
We'd better commit suicide then!

00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:20.950
What?

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:22.783
Eight of you
will hang yourselves together?

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:25.075
How amazing!

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:26.991
Help!

00:10:27.283 --> 00:10:30.408
Daughters-in-law, are you all right?

00:10:30.491 --> 00:10:31.616
Pak-fu.

00:10:31.783 --> 00:10:35.408
Do you want them all to die?
Will you feel happy about that?

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:36.366
I don't mean...

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.658
Let me go, I want to die.

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:39.908
Don't do that!

00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:42.575
-Mother, let us die.
-Mother, let us die.

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:44.325
-Just let us die.
-Just let us die.

00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:46.950
Pak-fu, can you say something?

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.741
Shut up.

00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:54.575
It's my fault.

00:10:55.366 --> 00:11:00.033
All of you are very nice,

00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:02.366
educated and civilized.

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.283
I should have appreciated that.
It's my fault.

00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:07.075
I am sorry, please forgive me.

00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:09.658
-I am glad about that!
-I am glad about that!

00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.866
Dear.

00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:13.575
-Smile.
-Come on.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.616
-Come on, smile.
-Right. Come on, smile.

00:11:20.616 --> 00:11:22.533
Why don't you laugh happily?

00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:23.700
You should laugh happily!

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.866
-Come on, be happy.
-Come on, be happy.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.241
Show us a happy look.

00:11:35.075 --> 00:11:40.491
-Fortune, make it two, why not eight?
-Four and four, you lose!

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.158
Let's play. Pak-fu, see.
They always want you to be happy.

00:11:43.241 --> 00:11:44.533
Don't misunderstand them.

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.908
Do you understand me?

00:11:47.075 --> 00:11:49.283
Madam, King Ning sent someone here
to visit Young Master.

00:11:49.491 --> 00:11:50.825
-King Ning?
-King Ning?

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:53.325
King Ning is planning a revolution.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.908
Does he want to recruit you?

00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.116
Anyway, just ask them to leave.
I don't want to see them.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.691
Madam, they...

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:10.275
Where is Tong Pak-fu?

00:12:10.508 --> 00:12:12.675
Our Majesty wants him
to be his consultant.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.883
Ask him to come out now.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.466
I am sorry.

00:12:15.591 --> 00:12:18.341
My son is very sick. He can't see you now.

00:12:18.508 --> 00:12:21.841
Please express our sincere thanks
to His Majesty.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.466
What a coincidence!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.175
Those we want to recruit always get sick.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.675
But it has been predicted
by His Majesty already.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:31.716
He asked us to bring the physician here

00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:33.300
to check on his sickness.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.883
Madam.

00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:38.383
Tong Pak-fu.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.841
Hey, isn't he sick?

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.925
He was seriously sick.

00:12:43.008 --> 00:12:46.841
But how can a patient get an appetite
to eat chicken wings?

00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:48.633
Yes, it's strange.

00:12:50.425 --> 00:12:52.800
It's simple because...

00:12:53.175 --> 00:12:57.675
<i>I love chicken wings</i>

00:12:57.758 --> 00:13:01.216
<i>But your mother said you are going to die</i>

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.466
<i>That's why he has to eat more
Before he dies</i>

00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:08.800
<i>If he doesn't eat now
He'll have no chance to eat</i>

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.550
<i>Are you going to die?</i>

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:12.258
<i>I am going to die</i>

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.508
<i>-If I don't eat now
-If I don't eat now</i>

00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.841
<i>-I will have no chance to eat
-I will have no chance to eat</i>

00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:20.591
But he doesn't seem to be seriously sick.

00:13:20.758 --> 00:13:22.925
Sir, check the pulse for Mr. Tong.

00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:24.425
See how serious his sickness is.

00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:28.383
His pulse is normal.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.466
I don't think he is sick.

00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:46.258
How is he?

00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:48.133
-Can I be saved?
-Let me try.

00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:03.883
What's wrong?

00:14:04.175 --> 00:14:06.508
I haven't experienced such a messy pulse.

00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:08.258
-What did you feel from his pulse?
-Music!

00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:09.258
What?

00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:11.716
I think you have to prepare
for your funeral.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.675
See you, Mr. Tong.

00:14:13.758 --> 00:14:16.466
We shouldn't have wasted our time.
Let's go.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.883
Sir, please save my...

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:22.008
Bastard, kneel.

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:26.091
Do you remember you made an oath
in front of your father's grave

00:14:26.341 --> 00:14:28.800
that you will never show others
you know kung fu?

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:31.091
Why did you show kung fu then?

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:33.716
I remember, but it was an emergency.

00:14:33.925 --> 00:14:36.341
I just used my kung fu to change my pulse.

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.591
But in case

00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:42.008
your secret is discovered by our enemies,

00:14:42.175 --> 00:14:44.633
you will be in danger.

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:47.716
Mother, who are our enemies?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.508
Why don't you tell me?

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.341
I was afraid you'd look for trouble
if I told you when you were young.

00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:56.133
But you've grown up,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.716
so I should tell you anyway.

00:14:58.508 --> 00:15:01.758
We have two enemies.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.841
<i>One is called Evil Scholar.</i>

00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:10.925
<i>He fought with your father</i>

00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:14.091
<i>for the ranking on the weapon list.</i>

00:15:14.716 --> 00:15:18.091
<i>I was afraid he would play tricks,</i>

00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:20.216
<i>so I stayed and watched over their duel.</i>

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.300
Let me trap you instead.

00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:32.341
Mr. Tin-ho, you will win, don't worry.

00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:49.425
Higher than you.

00:15:50.508 --> 00:15:51.550
Go to hell.

00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:56.216
What is it?

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.675
Chussy.

00:16:00.966 --> 00:16:02.216
Watch out.

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:15.508
Go to hell.

00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:21.591
Chussy, you...

00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:23.675
Be careful!

00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:35.508
I have to use the last stance!

00:16:37.008 --> 00:16:38.091
Go to hell.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:49.550
Chussy, what the hell are you doing here?

00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:51.383
Be careful!

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:54.383
Don't go! You should tell me
what you are doing here.

00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:56.758
I love you, so I want to help you.

00:16:56.883 --> 00:16:59.216
Do you think the red beans can help me?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.550
They are not red beans.

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:02.716
It's my new invention, the Tiny Bombs!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.091
What? Tiny?

00:17:05.216 --> 00:17:08.425
Don't look down upon it.
It's really powerful when it explodes.

00:17:08.508 --> 00:17:11.716
What? Powerful what? It will explode?

00:17:16.216 --> 00:17:19.800
Damn you, Chussy. You want to play tricks?

00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:23.383
The Killing Sword Stance
of the Evil Scholar?

00:17:24.133 --> 00:17:25.925
In the most critical moment,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.633
your father attacked him

00:17:28.716 --> 00:17:32.216
with the most horrible weapon
in the world.

00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:35.216
He turned the whole situation around.

00:17:35.716 --> 00:17:37.008
Watch out.

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.216
My Wonder Spear!

00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:50.508
Where is the spearhead?

00:17:58.675 --> 00:17:59.716
Why?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.633
That's why Father died in great sorrow.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.341
He didn't expect Evil Scholar's Sword
to ruin the steel-made spearhead.

00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:09.341
Before his death,

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:12.800
he made an invincible spearhead!

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.800
He was worried that the Evil Scholar
would kill the whole family.

00:18:15.883 --> 00:18:17.633
How about the other enemy?

00:18:17.841 --> 00:18:19.133
Who is the next one?

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:22.091
She was your father's girlfriend.
She fought with me for him.

00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:23.591
But she got married later.

00:18:23.675 --> 00:18:26.133
I don't think you will meet her.

00:18:26.716 --> 00:18:28.675
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

00:18:28.758 --> 00:18:30.216
Don't distract me from gambling.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.591
Mother, I want to leave home

00:18:32.675 --> 00:18:33.716
for a few days.

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:36.466
I am afraid the people with King Ning
will come and bother us.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.050
You should bring along the invincible
spearhead with you, just to be safe.

00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:42.633
Remember.

00:18:43.675 --> 00:18:48.133
-Let's play.
-Come on!

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.216
Since your father lost the duel,

00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:52.341
Evil Scholar's Sword is ranked second

00:18:52.425 --> 00:18:54.633
on the weapon list.

00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.758
Our Tong's Spear is ranked third.

00:18:56.883 --> 00:18:59.050
Siu Lee's Dagger is ranked fourth.

00:18:59.216 --> 00:19:00.175
Move!

00:19:01.383 --> 00:19:03.675
Who is the champion?

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:08.008
The mother of Siu Lee's Dagger,
but she passed away.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.675
What a pity.

00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:14.508
Cut the crap. Play with me.

00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:16.883
Fortune, bingo. Make it six.

00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:17.883
Drink.

00:19:18.008 --> 00:19:21.091
You are too poor to compete with me.
Get lost, I want to play with Mother.

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:25.758
-Fortune, make it three. Why not nine?
-Fortune, make it three. Why not nine?

00:19:26.008 --> 00:19:27.466
You lost. Drink.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.966
I am not scared.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:36.966
Come on, bet now.

00:19:42.925 --> 00:19:46.091
Fortune, four and four...

00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:47.633
You lost, drink.

00:19:47.716 --> 00:19:50.883
<i>I am so miserable</i>

00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:54.050
<i>My wives are abnormal housewives</i>

00:19:54.216 --> 00:19:57.258
<i>But others envy me so much</i>

00:19:57.341 --> 00:20:02.550
<i>In fact, I am lonely</i>

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:10.675
Look, the Four Scholars are over there.

00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:13.258
Go and have a look, hurry.

00:20:49.383 --> 00:20:52.466
You can never escape.

00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:55.008
Pak-fu, it's crowded.

00:20:56.633 --> 00:20:59.591
We came here for a tour.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.758
That's why the women are that crazy.

00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:02.800
That's why!

00:21:02.883 --> 00:21:06.300
Why don't we have a poetry competition?

00:21:06.383 --> 00:21:07.550
Good idea!

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:09.175
Why don't you start first, Man-bun?

00:21:09.258 --> 00:21:10.258
I am good in this field.

00:21:11.216 --> 00:21:12.800
There are many geese under the mountain.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.466
They rushed down to the river.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.341
Let's roast a goose.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.175
After eating, go home
and play with your wife.

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:23.800
Good, very good.

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:25.008
Very good.

00:21:28.008 --> 00:21:29.925
Is it that funny?

00:21:30.966 --> 00:21:33.966
Why is he always so happy
when he is on a trip?

00:21:34.133 --> 00:21:38.758
I envy him so much.

00:21:39.383 --> 00:21:42.550
He is so good

00:21:42.716 --> 00:21:44.008
at writing poems.

00:21:44.091 --> 00:21:46.508
And he is an excellent artist.

00:21:46.633 --> 00:21:49.050
He is really great!

00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.966
And he is good

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.133
at playing music too.

00:21:54.425 --> 00:21:57.216
Right, I know how to play

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.008
all kinds of musical instruments.

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:00.550
I have studied a new kind of music.

00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:02.841
It's great.

00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:05.425
Let's play it together
if we have a chance.

00:22:05.508 --> 00:22:10.300
-I love it.
-But I envy you because of your wives.

00:22:10.466 --> 00:22:12.175
All your wives are pretty.

00:22:12.258 --> 00:22:15.966
I don't think

00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:20.008
you will have any regrets in your life.

00:22:20.091 --> 00:22:21.966
I envy you so much.

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:25.133
Bravo.

00:22:28.466 --> 00:22:29.841
There is something attractive.

00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:33.258
Look, there is a beauty.
She seems to be lonely.

00:22:33.341 --> 00:22:36.425
Why not show us

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.508
how to court a girl?

00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:42.508
Let us learn!

00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:43.800
Well...

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.800
It's like a charity for your friends.
Will you do that for us?

00:22:47.883 --> 00:22:49.050
I am glad to demonstrate.

00:22:49.258 --> 00:22:50.258
Go.

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.050
Miss.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.133
What's the matter?

00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:24.508
-Go.
-Go.

00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:32.841
May I put my head on your shoulder?

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:35.508
No, I am a girl. A decent girl.

00:23:35.883 --> 00:23:39.466
I know, I want to make
my friends happy, that's all.

00:23:39.591 --> 00:23:41.800
I am Tong Pak-fu.

00:23:41.883 --> 00:23:44.175
So what? I don't know you.

00:23:44.258 --> 00:23:45.966
I'll scream for help
if you don't leave me alone.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.258
How about I'll pay you one tael?

00:23:48.508 --> 00:23:50.216
Who do you think I am?

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.341
Make it ten.

00:23:51.841 --> 00:23:53.633
That's too expensive.
Why don't you just rob me?

00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:55.216
Right, I am a robber.

00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:56.633
Give me all your money.

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:00.675
Go to hell.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.716
Go to hell.

00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:04.800
What's wrong?

00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:11.050
Did you really need to make
a serious punch like this?

00:24:11.133 --> 00:24:12.925
A robber! It's a ladyboy!

00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:14.675
-A ladyboy?
-A ladyboy?

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.175
I love that. Hold this.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.508
He is faster than me! Damn it.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.508
Look, so many people!

00:24:47.591 --> 00:24:50.133
Yes, it's crowded.

00:24:50.216 --> 00:24:53.008
Chung-heung, Ha-heung,
shut up and behave yourself.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.216
What's going on?

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.175
Excuse me.

00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:07.591
Madam Wah and her four pretty maids
have come to pray.

00:25:07.716 --> 00:25:09.800
The maids are all pretty.

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:11.383
Especially Chou-heung.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.050
Who is she? Who is Chou-heung?

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:14.258
Look! That way.

00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:16.216
Chou-heung.

00:25:29.258 --> 00:25:30.675
Damn, she is not pretty at all.

00:25:30.758 --> 00:25:32.133
You know,

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.633
a pretty woman is like a flower.

00:25:34.716 --> 00:25:37.133
You'll be all eyes for her beauty
when some leaves are around.

00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:38.258
Look once more.

00:25:38.883 --> 00:25:40.716
-Pretty woman!
-Pretty woman!

00:25:44.758 --> 00:25:47.050
She is really pretty!

00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:48.258
Let's go to the temple together.

00:25:48.341 --> 00:25:50.050
-To look for fun!
-To look for fun!

00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:56.508
You will be our leader!

00:25:56.591 --> 00:25:57.716
Follow me.

00:25:59.633 --> 00:26:00.841
-Give me.
-Give me.

00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:04.425
Go away, go that way!

00:26:04.841 --> 00:26:07.050
Move aside.

00:26:07.925 --> 00:26:10.716
Let's make use of any chance
to take advantage.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.883
Sure.

00:26:12.216 --> 00:26:13.508
Give the beggars some bread.

00:26:13.675 --> 00:26:15.133
-Yes, Madam.
-Yes, Madam.

00:26:21.508 --> 00:26:23.008
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.

00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:25.883
Go.

00:26:25.966 --> 00:26:26.925
Go!

00:26:27.008 --> 00:26:28.341
Be merciful!

00:26:28.466 --> 00:26:31.883
Any kind of bread will do! Come on!

00:26:34.758 --> 00:26:37.716
It's yours, everyone will get his share.

00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:45.091
Don't fight for it. It's yours.

00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:49.008
Madam, this is for you.

00:26:49.258 --> 00:26:53.675
Help! I am damn hungry!

00:26:57.175 --> 00:26:59.008
Are you hungry? Eat this.

00:27:00.466 --> 00:27:02.133
What? Is one not enough?

00:27:04.758 --> 00:27:05.925
One more for you.

00:27:10.383 --> 00:27:12.633
Come over, here's some bread.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.633
Be good. Come on, eat this.

00:27:59.883 --> 00:28:02.591
<i>I've got it. The prettiest smile</i>

00:28:02.675 --> 00:28:04.300
<i>is a smile with love.</i>

00:28:04.841 --> 00:28:06.466
<i>I have found my dream lover.</i>

00:28:08.508 --> 00:28:09.675
<i>She is Chou-heung.</i>

00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:43.966
Miss, are you here to worship God?

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.591
It's good to worship God.
You will be blessed.

00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:50.466
Let me do it for you.

00:28:57.925 --> 00:28:59.300
To worship God...

00:29:06.675 --> 00:29:08.591
KEEP QUIET

00:29:16.091 --> 00:29:18.716
Hey, chase after the boat of Madam Wah.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.758
Fine.

00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.008
Be careful.

00:29:25.383 --> 00:29:29.800
You are wise to choose my boat.

00:29:30.008 --> 00:29:31.716
My boat is the fastest one.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.675
Really?

00:29:33.383 --> 00:29:37.425
-Hey, your boat is sinking.
-Right, it's the fastest to sink.

00:29:37.758 --> 00:29:41.550
-What's wrong? I am in a hurry!
-I think you are chasing Chou-heung.

00:29:41.633 --> 00:29:42.591
How did you know that?

00:29:42.675 --> 00:29:44.925
I have seen many of your kind.

00:29:45.008 --> 00:29:48.133
But it's useless to court her
outside Madam Wah's residence.

00:29:48.216 --> 00:29:49.383
What good idea would you suggest?

00:29:49.633 --> 00:29:52.216
You should go to Madam Wah's residence.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.008
-Suggest me some ideas, please.
-But it depends on your offer.

00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:56.258
All right.

00:29:56.341 --> 00:29:57.591
Listen.

00:30:04.716 --> 00:30:05.550
Hey.

00:30:05.716 --> 00:30:07.925
You can't move. Got it?

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.550
Don't try to trick me. You should pay me!

00:30:10.633 --> 00:30:12.383
How can I trick a wise guy like you?

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.550
That's right.

00:30:15.591 --> 00:30:20.550
Cheap man! A brand new cheap man for sale.

00:30:20.633 --> 00:30:23.050
Come and have a look!

00:30:25.508 --> 00:30:26.675
I'm so poor!

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:29.175
Hey, young man. Are you selling yourself
to bury your father?

00:30:29.341 --> 00:30:31.341
But it's unlucky to see a dead body
early in the morning.

00:30:31.425 --> 00:30:32.633
I didn't want to do this either.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.341
You look familiar.
Have I met you somewhere before?

00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:37.675
-Really?
-It doesn't matter, let's be friends.

00:30:37.758 --> 00:30:39.925
Why don't you be merciful? Buy me, please.

00:30:40.008 --> 00:30:41.175
What a pity.

00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:43.883
We need a servant, why not...

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.508
I am poor.

00:30:46.591 --> 00:30:48.966
I am selling myself
to bury my whole family!

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.800
Are you kidding me?

00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:58.466
Be merciful.

00:30:58.758 --> 00:31:01.383
My family died last night.

00:31:01.508 --> 00:31:06.258
I am sick. Why don't you buy me?
I will even make it half price!

00:31:06.883 --> 00:31:08.758
He is poorer.

00:31:08.966 --> 00:31:10.508
Why don't we buy him to be our servant?

00:31:10.716 --> 00:31:12.216
Let's buy him.

00:31:12.883 --> 00:31:14.883
Lady, first come, first served.
I came first.

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:17.258
-It's not a problem of priority.
-Right.

00:31:17.341 --> 00:31:19.550
He has to bury six people,
but you only have to bury one.

00:31:19.758 --> 00:31:23.050
I want to help you, but it's difficult
for me to buy two people.

00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:24.383
But I am poor too.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:26.591
Show me how poor you are.

00:31:26.675 --> 00:31:27.758
Well, I...

00:31:28.758 --> 00:31:31.133
See how dirty my fingernails are?

00:31:31.216 --> 00:31:33.341
I'm very pitiful, right?

00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:37.841
Wong Choi.

00:31:38.008 --> 00:31:40.716
Wong Choi, don't die! Don't die.

00:31:41.091 --> 00:31:45.508
You have followed me for a long time.
You were so good to me.

00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:49.050
But I have never given you
sufficient food.

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:51.841
I am really sorry.

00:31:55.383 --> 00:31:56.466
Watch out.

00:32:01.716 --> 00:32:04.175
Siu Keung, how are you?

00:32:04.466 --> 00:32:06.175
Don't die, Siu Keung. Don't die.

00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:09.091
We have suffered for such a long time.

00:32:09.383 --> 00:32:12.966
I even treat you like my own relative.

00:32:13.258 --> 00:32:16.508
How can you leave me like this?

00:32:18.216 --> 00:32:20.550
Chou-heung, they are very poor.
What should we do?

00:32:20.883 --> 00:32:22.091
-Let's wait and see.
-All right.

00:32:23.425 --> 00:32:24.425
Damn!

00:32:25.883 --> 00:32:26.883
Hey, wait.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.133
Look at you. You look rich.
Why don't you go home and put on makeup?

00:32:30.216 --> 00:32:33.841
Look at me. I am thin
and you can see the abscess on my arms!

00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:35.050
I am poorer.

00:32:35.216 --> 00:32:37.341
Buddy, don't challenge me.

00:32:37.425 --> 00:32:38.508
So what?

00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:41.216
-Are you pushing me?
-I am poorer, so what?

00:32:41.716 --> 00:32:42.800
Go to hell!

00:32:43.841 --> 00:32:45.466
Screw it!

00:32:46.966 --> 00:32:50.050
Look, my arm is broken. Who is poorer now?

00:32:50.258 --> 00:32:51.425
Don't go too far!

00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.258
It's show-hand, so what?

00:32:54.383 --> 00:32:55.716
I'll play with you.

00:32:56.258 --> 00:32:57.550
Okay, I will show my hands too.

00:33:02.133 --> 00:33:03.300
Are you playing tricks with me?

00:33:03.466 --> 00:33:05.966
I don't want my life either.
Let's see how can you compete with me.

00:33:06.475 --> 00:33:09.350
Who is poorer?

00:33:12.266 --> 00:33:14.641
Bravo! You are really great.

00:33:14.725 --> 00:33:16.975
Hey, he is dead. I can buy you now.

00:33:17.058 --> 00:33:18.225
-Really?
-Right.

00:33:18.308 --> 00:33:20.433
-Another five taels.
-How can you suddenly raise your price?

00:33:20.516 --> 00:33:23.683
I want to bury him too.
You are so kind. Let's buy him.

00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:28.141
Shek-lau, we have to ask
for Madam's permission first.

00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:30.850
-Come again early tomorrow morning.
-I'm going to ask Madam now.

00:33:31.592 --> 00:33:33.800
Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:39.450
Such a seducing smile!

00:33:39.575 --> 00:33:41.241
Mother, I did it.

00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:46.625
<i>Since you are so kindhearted,
I'm now buying you to be a servant.</i>

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:48.250
<i>For six years. Any problem?</i>

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:49.250
<i>No problem.</i>

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:51.625
<i>-Sign the contract now.
-I am signing it.</i>

00:34:00.458 --> 00:34:02.333
Mo Chong-yuen has arrived.

00:34:02.983 --> 00:34:04.066
Why don't you squat?

00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:09.000
Kid, from today onwards,
you are a servant here.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.416
9527 is your number. Start working.

00:34:13.125 --> 00:34:15.750
-Life is difficult.
-Life is difficult.

00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:17.666
But you have to smile
even when you are scolded.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.208
Life is difficult.

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.250
You have to smile
even when you are scolded.

00:34:23.375 --> 00:34:26.208
-Life is difficult.
-Life is difficult.

00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:31.333
1001, 1002, 1003, 1004...

00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:34.291
How can you do this? Once more.

00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:35.958
One, two...

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:41.416
Hurry up.

00:34:44.208 --> 00:34:46.833
Roast it carefully.
Reserve the best part for me.

00:34:46.916 --> 00:34:48.208
It's time for dinner!

00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:19.125
SERVANTS AND DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER

00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:23.958
Higher, fly it higher.

00:35:24.166 --> 00:35:25.458
It's fun.

00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:27.000
Here's a chance.

00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:34.166
It's cut!

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.125
-What should I do?
-What happened, miss?

00:35:36.458 --> 00:35:39.166
9527, get the kite down for us.

00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:41.875
-Right. Hurry up.
-I'm a low-ranking servant.

00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:43.250
I'm not allowed to enter this place.

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:44.916
We don't treat you
as a low-ranking servant.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.625
I just treat you like a dog!

00:35:46.916 --> 00:35:49.583
-Go and get it, go!
-Go.

00:35:50.166 --> 00:35:51.583
Up there.

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.958
Ms. Chou-heung, nice to meet you.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.750
I didn't have a chance to thank you.

00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:58.375
But it's destiny for us to meet again.

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.291
Don't worry about the kite.
I will get it for you.

00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:02.791
-Cut the crap. Go and get it now.
-Okay.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.625
-9527, be careful!
-9527, be careful!

00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:11.583
Thank you for your concern,
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:36:18.916 --> 00:36:19.916
9527.

00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:24.375
What's wrong? Are you all right?

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.000
I am all right, but I broke my arm.

00:36:28.541 --> 00:36:30.000
You are too careless!

00:36:30.916 --> 00:36:32.625
I am scared of nothing

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:35.708
as long as I can get the kite for you.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.833
It is just an arm. It's nothing.

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:43.000
I am sorry. I have misunderstood you.

00:36:43.083 --> 00:36:46.541
Don't say that. Nobody is perfect.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.958
No!

00:36:58.541 --> 00:37:00.166
-Forget it.
-Don't go!

00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:11.791
-Great! They are lovers at last!
-Great! They are lovers at last!

00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:23.083
What is he laughing about?

00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:26.250
Let's see what he is doing.

00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:29.583
9527, what are you doing? Come down now.

00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:31.708
Coming!

00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:38.125
Watch out!

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:40.541
<i>Chou-heung, I am coming.</i>

00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:45.708
I heard

00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:49.125
that you have been drawing
pictures of her secretly, right?

00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:52.416
I have drawn many pictures.
Which one do you mean?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.708
Look at what he has drawn.

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:04.375
How dare you! How dare you make
my beautiful goddess, Shek-lau,

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.208
so ugly in your picture?

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:09.166
I am sorry.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.125
-Please give it back.
-You are not gifted at drawing.

00:38:11.208 --> 00:38:12.250
You'd better quit!

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:17.208
I must let you learn from my work!

00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:19.708
This is called a drawing, look!

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.291
You are very great at drawing!

00:38:26.416 --> 00:38:27.416
I admire you so much!

00:38:28.708 --> 00:38:30.291
Look!

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:34.791
You know what a drawing is now?

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.083
You are lazy
and you dare to fight with me for a girl.

00:38:37.166 --> 00:38:38.250
Beat him up!

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.583
Stop fighting!

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:43.708
Stop or I will inform Madam!

00:38:43.791 --> 00:38:44.958
Stop!

00:38:47.541 --> 00:38:49.500
I am giving face to Ms. Chou-heung.
Let's go.

00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:50.791
-Go.
-Go.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.875
Are you dying?

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:58.166
Not yet, I won't die

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.583
until I give you back the kite,
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:39:03.125 --> 00:39:04.125
Let's go.

00:39:06.291 --> 00:39:09.583
Not that easy! You broke our kite.
Let's beat him to death!

00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:19.708
Luckily, I tried my best
to protect my face,

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:22.375
so my handsome look is not ruined.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.791
I must tell her how much I love her.

00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:28.541
She will be touched!

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.625
Who dares to beat me?

00:39:32.708 --> 00:39:34.708
It's me. The prettiest woman, Shek-lau.

00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:37.500
It's you? Why did you hit me?

00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.000
Go to hell!

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.166
Why?

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.333
Why? Because you deserve it.

00:39:43.875 --> 00:39:45.833
Now everyone knows

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.625
you have been drawing my picture secretly.

00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:50.416
How will I face others?
I am better off dead.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500
-That's good.
-Of course you'd agree.

00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:55.458
You want to die with me
like Romeo and Juliet.

00:39:55.833 --> 00:39:58.166
Damn you, I don't like you at all.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.625
Ms. Shek-lau, you've misunderstood.

00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:02.333
In fact, I respect you so much.
I treat you like my mother.

00:40:02.416 --> 00:40:03.375
Mother?

00:40:03.583 --> 00:40:09.000
How could you fall for your mother?
Goodness, this is very bad!

00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:10.791
But it's very exciting.

00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:14.000
Come on, I've never experienced it.
I am a little bit nervous.

00:40:14.166 --> 00:40:15.916
-Come on, hurry up.
-Hey.

00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:17.666
Are you crazy?

00:40:17.875 --> 00:40:19.583
Don't talk, do it now.

00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:23.166
Don't save your energy
because I am pretty and civilized.

00:40:24.916 --> 00:40:27.625
How unlucky of me to meet such a hag!

00:40:28.375 --> 00:40:29.416
Good!

00:40:33.083 --> 00:40:34.041
Sir.

00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:37.583
Sir, we heard that the four maids
of Madam Wah are all pretty.

00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:40.333
Especially Chou-heung. She is very pretty!

00:40:40.416 --> 00:40:41.875
Chou-heung will go to our boss of course.

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:43.375
-Sure.
-Sir.

00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:44.833
How about this one? Should we kill him?

00:40:44.958 --> 00:40:48.416
No, he is one of us.

00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:50.250
-Just knock him out.
-All right!

00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:54.000
You must be the famous
Four Perverted Heroes.

00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:57.041
Yes, we are the famous
Four Perverted Heroes.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.041
Fine. To be frank,

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:04.291
I am the legendary, handsome, renowned,

00:41:04.375 --> 00:41:07.208
perverted Little Wolf, Chow Pak-tung.

00:41:07.458 --> 00:41:08.958
-I haven't heard of your name!
-Hey.

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:12.125
This little wolf is so fearless
that he assaulted this ugly woman.

00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:14.625
How could I reject the name Little Wolf?

00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:15.583
She is nothing.

00:41:15.666 --> 00:41:17.083
There were girls who are worse than her.

00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:19.250
I respect you so much.
May I call you Senior?

00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:20.500
You are flattering me!

00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:22.916
I heard that you want
to assault Chou-heung.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.875
That's right.

00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:25.666
If you don't mind,
let me bring you to her room!

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.208
Do you want to have a turn after me?

00:41:27.958 --> 00:41:29.541
-You first of course.
-Thank you.

00:41:30.125 --> 00:41:31.875
Clean your shoes. Don't leave any marks.

00:41:49.458 --> 00:41:51.666
Where is Little Wolf?

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.041
Go get him to lead the way.

00:41:56.875 --> 00:41:57.958
CHOU

00:41:58.375 --> 00:41:59.416
Found it.

00:42:03.833 --> 00:42:05.416
9527, why are you here?

00:42:05.791 --> 00:42:08.333
You're in big trouble!
Some rapists have come for you.

00:42:10.541 --> 00:42:13.250
I am scared. What should we do now?

00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:14.583
I have misled their way.

00:42:14.666 --> 00:42:16.750
This place is so big.
They won't find their way. Why not...

00:42:16.833 --> 00:42:18.333
What's wrong with your nose?
It's bleeding.

00:42:18.416 --> 00:42:19.833
The perverted thieves hurt me.

00:42:19.916 --> 00:42:21.208
It's nothing. No big deal.

00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:23.166
In order to save you,
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.750
You should hide first. Come with me.

00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:27.375
Just to be safe, let me take a look first.

00:42:31.958 --> 00:42:33.541
Never mind, I am fine.

00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:36.666
Stop, you are the perverted thief!

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:40.125
You may call me a thief,
but I'm not a perverted thief.

00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:42.125
You may call me a thief of love
because I steal hearts.

00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:43.625
I don't care what kind of thief you are.

00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:45.666
Stop playing tricks in front of me.

00:42:46.083 --> 00:42:47.541
It will make me hate you more.

00:42:47.666 --> 00:42:49.750
When you find out
that you are accusing me,

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.333
you will feel sorrow and regret.

00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:53.541
-Follow me and hide first.
-Get lost.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.833
If there is a thief,

00:42:56.208 --> 00:42:58.708
why didn't you inform Madam,
but come here instead?

00:42:58.916 --> 00:43:02.125
Don't think that you can take advantage
of innocent girls.

00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:05.083
Let me tell you.
It's fine for a man to be poor,

00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:07.333
but he should be well-behaved.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.541
Although you are educated,
you are rubbish anyway.

00:43:10.958 --> 00:43:13.166
Great! I am a man.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.708
I should have beaten you to death
after hearing such insulting words.

00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:17.833
But I won't do that. Maybe you are right.

00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:19.916
-Maybe I am rubbish.
-Maybe more than rubbish.

00:43:20.375 --> 00:43:21.708
I have to call you a bastard.

00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:26.166
Good! But you hate me so much.

00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:29.875
Then why did you give me
those three affectionate smiles?

00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:33.708
Did I do that?

00:43:33.875 --> 00:43:34.916
Look, you did it again.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.791
Even though I smiled at you,

00:43:37.291 --> 00:43:39.041
it is just to tease you
because you are an idiot.

00:43:44.166 --> 00:43:49.416
I see. It's only a misunderstanding.

00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:52.291
I'm sorry. I'm too stupid
to misunderstand your smile.

00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:54.500
But you are really in danger.
You'd better be careful.

00:43:57.333 --> 00:43:59.750
Why are there so many useless men
in this world?

00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:04.416
I wonder if Tong Pak-fu
is the only ideal man in this world.

00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:08.250
Only a romantic man
can write such a romantic poem.

00:44:08.583 --> 00:44:10.666
"The temple is located inside
the peach blossom garden.

00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:13.000
There is a fairy of peach blossom.

00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:15.791
The fairy of peach blossom
planted the peach blossom trees.

00:44:16.166 --> 00:44:18.666
She traded the flowers for sweet wine."

00:44:22.166 --> 00:44:24.541
"The people thought I was insane.

00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:27.250
But they don't really understand me.

00:44:27.916 --> 00:44:30.083
Can't you see the graves of the heroes?

00:44:30.416 --> 00:44:33.125
No flowers, no wine, but who cares?"

00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:42.791
I love this poem!

00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:44.500
Why are you standing there?

00:44:45.083 --> 00:44:46.875
You recited Tong Pak-fu's poem.

00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.708
In fact, it's an insult.

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:51.041
You're not qualified to recite his poem.
Get lost now.

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:52.333
Watch out, it's dangerous.

00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:56.000
Chou-heung, I finally understand.

00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:00.416
How dare you! You have gone too far.

00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:02.625
If you don't leave,
I won't give you a chance.

00:45:03.625 --> 00:45:05.208
Don't force me to use the last move.

00:45:06.208 --> 00:45:07.750
Chou-heung, you are too impulsive.

00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.375
I don't blame you. You are still young.

00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:10.625
But I really love...

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:12.791
Cross Killing Rod!

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.083
<i>I must tell you the truth.</i>

00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:21.708
Listen, I am Tong Pak-fu!

00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:25.000
Tong Pak-fu?

00:45:25.916 --> 00:45:26.875
Yes?

00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:28.666
If you were Tong Pak-fu,
I would be the goddess!

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:29.666
Go to hell!

00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:34.875
It's so destructive!

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.375
Little Wolf, you are really a pervert!

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.208
Wake up, Senior!

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:41.500
"Senior"?

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.500
Thief!

00:45:43.583 --> 00:45:45.750
Come out and catch the thieves!

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.500
-Thief!
-Take her away.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.666
Let me go!

00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:57.000
-Let me go!
-Go!

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:01.041
-Help! Hands off!
-Don't move, surrender now!

00:46:01.208 --> 00:46:02.250
Do you think I'm an idiot?

00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:36.508
Come on.

00:46:36.966 --> 00:46:38.175
Attack!

00:46:54.525 --> 00:46:57.066
Mo Chong-yuen,
how did these thieves get in?

00:46:57.358 --> 00:46:58.483
Madam.

00:46:58.608 --> 00:46:59.650
Speak.

00:47:01.358 --> 00:47:04.816
Madam, I saw 9527 with these people.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.108
Our residence will not be safe
if a thief is living in our residence.

00:47:09.733 --> 00:47:12.275
-Take them to the police.
-All right.

00:47:12.483 --> 00:47:13.691
I am being framed, Madam.

00:47:13.858 --> 00:47:16.108
Madam, I have picked up
a book from the ground.

00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:18.358
<i>TONG YAN'S POETRY</i>

00:47:18.483 --> 00:47:19.775
Shit.

00:47:20.816 --> 00:47:22.566
Whose book is this?

00:47:23.483 --> 00:47:27.316
I've said it many times.
Tong Pak-fu's stuff is not allowed here.

00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:29.983
Whose book is it? Confess now.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.066
Chou-heung, do you know whose book it is?

00:47:32.525 --> 00:47:34.358
-Madam, I...
-Tell me now.

00:47:34.525 --> 00:47:36.525
Madam, I know.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:37.816
Tell me.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.775
It's mine.

00:47:40.025 --> 00:47:42.400
If you want to punish someone,
please punish me.

00:47:42.775 --> 00:47:45.025
-Mo Chong-yuen.
-Yes, Madam.

00:47:45.775 --> 00:47:47.150
Whom should I punish?

00:47:47.566 --> 00:47:50.233
Madam, please punish me.

00:47:50.525 --> 00:47:52.441
All right. Fine.

00:47:52.816 --> 00:47:54.941
Take him out and chop him into pieces.
Then feed our dogs.

00:47:55.566 --> 00:47:56.983
-Go.
-Don't!

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.483
In fact, I wanted to mislead the thieves
to save Chou-heung.

00:48:00.816 --> 00:48:01.733
Madam.

00:48:01.816 --> 00:48:03.775
I don't care what your relationship
with the thieves is.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.358
But you deserve to be killed
for having Tong Pak-fu's book.

00:48:06.983 --> 00:48:09.191
Madam, please listen to my explanation.

00:48:09.358 --> 00:48:10.608
What explanation?

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.900
<i>Madam, my hometown is Suzhou</i>

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:25.108
<i>I was wealthy</i>

00:48:25.358 --> 00:48:28.858
<i>But Tong Pak-fu was such a bastard</i>

00:48:29.025 --> 00:48:31.025
<i>He colluded with the government</i>

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:33.275
<i>He took away my wealth</i>

00:48:33.608 --> 00:48:35.400
<i>My grandfather argued with him</i>

00:48:35.483 --> 00:48:37.400
<i>But he was beaten to death</i>

00:48:37.483 --> 00:48:39.275
<i>My grandmother scolded him</i>

00:48:39.358 --> 00:48:41.108
<i>But she was dragged to his residence</i>

00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:43.358
<i>How pitiful was she
She was assaulted over 100 times</i>

00:48:43.441 --> 00:48:45.441
<i>She hanged herself to death at last</i>

00:48:45.608 --> 00:48:49.275
<i>Tong Pak-fu kicked my father and me
Out of our house</i>

00:48:49.358 --> 00:48:52.400
<i>To feed my father, I became a beggar</i>

00:48:52.608 --> 00:48:54.775
<i>But Tong Pak-fu was too cruel</i>

00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:57.275
<i>He sent someone to attack us</i>

00:48:57.358 --> 00:48:59.150
<i>My father and I were beaten terribly</i>

00:48:59.316 --> 00:49:01.566
<i>I am stronger than my father</i>

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.233
<i>But my father was beaten to death</i>

00:49:03.316 --> 00:49:04.358
<i>I could never forget this</i>

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:07.275
<i>To bury my father, I had to sell myself</i>

00:49:07.358 --> 00:49:09.358
<i>To save money and to study
At the same time</i>

00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:11.775
<i>In hopes to get a degree
And gain power in the government</i>

00:49:11.858 --> 00:49:13.566
<i>So that I can take revenge</i>

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.775
<i>That's why I take his poetry with me
To remember him always</i>

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.900
<i>It's too exciting!</i>

00:49:57.025 --> 00:49:58.650
<i>I want to praise him.</i>

00:49:59.483 --> 00:50:01.525
<i>No, I can't show this.</i>

00:50:01.775 --> 00:50:05.025
<i>But this feeling is amazing.</i>

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.066
<i>Such a touching story!</i>

00:50:07.191 --> 00:50:09.983
<i>He told his story in the form of rap!</i>

00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:13.150
<i>It's really interesting and touching!</i>

00:50:13.691 --> 00:50:17.233
<i>I am very amazed.</i>

00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:20.275
<i>Right, and his creativity...</i>

00:50:20.358 --> 00:50:22.941
<i>It's rich and powerful!</i>

00:50:23.108 --> 00:50:25.066
<i>He is so creative!</i>

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:27.233
<i>Yes, he is creative!</i>

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.400
<i>I am now full of power!</i>

00:50:29.733 --> 00:50:32.275
<i>-Thank you, 9527.
-Thank you, 9527.</i>

00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:33.733
It's not touching enough yet.

00:50:34.108 --> 00:50:35.525
Watch me.

00:50:35.608 --> 00:50:38.275
What do we have to poop after eating?

00:50:38.358 --> 00:50:40.108
After pooping, we have to clean it.

00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:43.025
Damn!

00:50:53.941 --> 00:50:57.483
So Tong Pak-fu is your enemy.

00:50:57.816 --> 00:50:58.900
Yes, Madam.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.941
Madam, look at this man.

00:51:02.233 --> 00:51:03.983
I don't think he is useless.

00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:07.483
He seems to be educated.

00:51:08.316 --> 00:51:10.608
Now, there is a vacancy in the study room.

00:51:17.733 --> 00:51:19.566
Why don't you ask him

00:51:19.733 --> 00:51:21.900
to help the young masters
with their studies?

00:51:23.191 --> 00:51:26.233
Since Chou-heung asked for mercy,
I won't kill you.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.566
From now on,

00:51:29.066 --> 00:51:32.066
I will name you Wah Shington!

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.941
I don't think that name suits me.

00:51:35.275 --> 00:51:37.358
Then, I'll call you Wah On.

00:51:37.525 --> 00:51:38.691
Thank you.

00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:40.066
WAH'S RESIDENCE

00:51:40.233 --> 00:51:42.566
I want Chou-heung to get the ink for me.

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.858
Do you want to fight with me
for Chou-heung?

00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:47.316
-I am older than you. She is mine.
-That's nonsense.

00:51:47.483 --> 00:51:49.358
-Do you want to compete with me?
-Go ahead!

00:51:49.941 --> 00:51:50.858
Damn you!

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:53.066
How dare you! Go to hell.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.358
How dare you!
I want to teach you a lesson!

00:51:58.191 --> 00:52:00.233
For Chou-heung, I won't give a damn!

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:05.816
<i>I am finally the servant</i>

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.400
<i>This is within my expectation</i>

00:52:08.566 --> 00:52:11.275
<i>I am closer to Chou-heung now</i>

00:52:11.358 --> 00:52:15.566
<i>I am in a good mood, very good mood</i>

00:52:16.441 --> 00:52:17.775
Where are the young masters?

00:52:22.925 --> 00:52:24.175
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

00:52:24.383 --> 00:52:26.466
I am a servant who will help
with your studies.

00:52:27.133 --> 00:52:29.841
You are the jerk
who disturbed my sleep last night.

00:52:29.925 --> 00:52:33.675
Right. You look great!

00:52:33.883 --> 00:52:35.883
I am pleased to serve you.

00:52:36.425 --> 00:52:37.758
I love this guy.

00:52:37.841 --> 00:52:40.383
-I'll treat you like a human being then.
-Get me tea.

00:52:40.466 --> 00:52:42.466
Sorry, there are three things I don't do.

00:52:42.633 --> 00:52:43.758
What are they?

00:52:43.841 --> 00:52:46.425
I won't serve others tea.
I won't wash clothes or clean the floor.

00:52:46.508 --> 00:52:47.925
I won't make my bed.

00:52:48.133 --> 00:52:49.300
Just like us.

00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:52.091
-What do you know then?
-I know...

00:52:52.758 --> 00:52:55.800
how to play all kinds of music!

00:52:55.883 --> 00:52:57.966
I know fortune-telling.

00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:01.633
I know how to court women too.

00:53:02.008 --> 00:53:04.133
-Really?
-Show us something now.

00:53:04.383 --> 00:53:06.216
I don't think it's fine
to show my skills here.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.758
I think you are bluffing!

00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:09.383
Read our fortunes then.

00:53:09.466 --> 00:53:11.091
I don't think you're capable.

00:53:11.883 --> 00:53:15.050
If I am not wrong,
then you must be mentally retarded.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.550
-You are so good!
-I admire you so much!

00:53:18.633 --> 00:53:21.091
-May I call you Brother?
-May I call you Brother?

00:53:21.341 --> 00:53:22.466
I don't mind.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.508
From now on, bring me tea,
wash my clothes and make my bed.

00:53:28.675 --> 00:53:29.758
Wah Man, Wah Mo.

00:53:29.883 --> 00:53:32.508
Why are you kneeling on the floor?

00:53:32.591 --> 00:53:34.841
-We're calling him our brother.
-We're calling him our brother.

00:53:35.841 --> 00:53:39.300
How can you be their brother?

00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:42.675
It's just a joke, please forgive me.

00:53:42.883 --> 00:53:45.383
-No, Wah On. We will follow you.
-No, Wah On. We will follow you.

00:53:46.091 --> 00:53:47.050
Young man.

00:53:47.133 --> 00:53:49.716
How dare you recruit my students?
Who are you?

00:53:50.008 --> 00:53:51.841
-May I know your name?
-May I know your name first?

00:53:51.925 --> 00:53:52.966
No, may I know your name?

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:55.341
-No, may I know your name first?
-I have to know your name first.

00:53:55.425 --> 00:53:57.591
-I'll tell you mine later.
-I won't, unless you tell me yours.

00:53:57.675 --> 00:53:58.550
No way.

00:53:58.675 --> 00:54:00.300
I come from Sishui.

00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:03.466
I am the teacher of the Wah family.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:04.925
Who are you?

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:06.133
I come from Suzhou.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.216
I am a mere servant in the Wah family.

00:54:08.383 --> 00:54:10.466
That's all about me.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:12.175
How dare you!

00:54:16.133 --> 00:54:21.591
Do you know how powerful I am?

00:54:21.716 --> 00:54:23.966
I will kill everything that's in my way!

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:25.091
Wah Man, Wah Mo.

00:54:28.508 --> 00:54:30.091
Sir, what are you doing?

00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:37.875
What's wrong with him?

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.666
Father, you accidentally killed
the teacher.

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.541
Congratulations, you killed him!

00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:44.541
No.

00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:47.000
I saw him performing some sort
of incantation to summon the gods.

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.208
He thought he was invincible.

00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:50.375
But he failed,
so he stabbed himself to death.

00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:52.291
Right?

00:54:52.375 --> 00:54:54.166
Yes, that's right.

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.541
-Right.
-Right. Hey!

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.666
-Take the corpse out.
-Yes.

00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:58.708
Who are you?

00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:01.000
-He's Wah On. He helps us study.
-Yes, Father.

00:55:01.458 --> 00:55:03.833
Wah On, you helped me a lot.

00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:04.791
It's nothing!

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:07.208
I want to promote you
to Senior Studying Companion.

00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:09.833
You're responsible for educating them,
do you understand?

00:55:09.916 --> 00:55:11.083
Thank you, sir.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.125
SENIOR STUDENT COMPANION

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:16.091
Wah On, go ahead.

00:56:16.175 --> 00:56:17.633
Come on!

00:56:17.716 --> 00:56:19.758
Wah On, come on.
Just like what you did that night.

00:56:19.841 --> 00:56:21.508
-Fine, listen to me.
-Fine.

00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:23.716
Wah On has two eyes.

00:56:24.008 --> 00:56:28.008
Three ladies have six breasts.

00:56:31.308 --> 00:56:33.558
-What's wrong?
-Wah On is telling dirty jokes.

00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:34.766
Right.

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.016
-Ms. Chou-heung.
-Wah On.

00:56:37.175 --> 00:56:38.633
Were you joking around with others?

00:56:38.758 --> 00:56:40.550
No, I was reciting a poem.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.633
-What kind of poem?
-Tong Pak-fu's poem?

00:56:43.216 --> 00:56:44.300
Of course not.

00:56:44.383 --> 00:56:46.841
-Tong Pak-fu is my enemy.
-You can't fool me!

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.758
But you are good

00:56:49.133 --> 00:56:52.300
at making such an interesting story
in a limited time.

00:56:53.508 --> 00:56:56.550
Ms. Chou-heung, you are really wise.

00:56:56.758 --> 00:57:00.841
But why did you impersonate
Tong Pak-fu that night?

00:57:03.008 --> 00:57:04.091
Guess.

00:57:06.175 --> 00:57:09.050
I know, you must know Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:10.050
Of course.

00:57:10.258 --> 00:57:11.675
Can you introduce him to me?

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.883
I am Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:13.008 --> 00:57:16.591
Don't joke around. I mean it.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.633
Everybody knows Tong Pak-fu.
He was born wild.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.383
But he doesn't know me.

00:57:22.675 --> 00:57:24.216
I think you have misunderstood
Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:24.633 --> 00:57:26.800
Being wild is just on the surface.

00:57:27.133 --> 00:57:29.966
But from his poems,

00:57:30.216 --> 00:57:32.716
I can tell that he is a passionate

00:57:33.008 --> 00:57:34.466
and righteous man.

00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:38.091
Hey.

00:57:38.633 --> 00:57:39.925
What are you doing?

00:57:40.341 --> 00:57:41.883
I feel so touched that I want to cry.

00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:44.758
You are a great observer.

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:47.300
If Tong Pak-fu had a friend like you,

00:57:47.591 --> 00:57:49.341
he wouldn't have any regrets.

00:57:49.758 --> 00:57:51.008
You are lying.

00:57:52.383 --> 00:57:53.675
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:57:54.425 --> 00:57:56.925
What do you think about me?

00:57:57.591 --> 00:57:58.758
I think

00:57:59.216 --> 00:58:00.633
you are a fool.

00:58:01.716 --> 00:58:03.383
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:58:06.258 --> 00:58:08.258
Are you willing to study poems and songs

00:58:08.758 --> 00:58:11.050
with this fool at midnight

00:58:11.466 --> 00:58:13.925
in front of the willow tree?

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:26.466
Fine.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:27.591
Thank you.

00:58:27.675 --> 00:58:28.800
Don't mention it.

00:58:28.883 --> 00:58:30.758
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.883
Chou-heung, Tong Pak-fu is caught
by our security, Mo Chong-yuen.

00:58:36.716 --> 00:58:38.216
Help!

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.091
-Shut up.
-Why?

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.091
I met this guy at the market.
He claimed to be Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:43.258 --> 00:58:45.175
He was selling Tong Pak-fu's paintings.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.966
So, I brought him here to you, Madam.

00:58:51.175 --> 00:58:52.758
It's the painting of Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:52.925 --> 00:58:54.841
I was framed. I am not Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:54.966 --> 00:58:57.466
If you are not him,
why do you have so many paintings of his?

00:58:58.383 --> 00:59:01.425
I stole them
when Tong Pak-fu wasn't at home.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.341
You say you are not Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:03.425 --> 00:59:04.425
Who are you then?

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:07.133
I am Chuck Chi-shan, I swear!

00:59:07.216 --> 00:59:08.300
You still won't admit it?

00:59:08.425 --> 00:59:10.383
Fine, Tung-heung.

00:59:10.716 --> 00:59:12.133
Ask Wah On to come here.

00:59:12.341 --> 00:59:15.633
I want him to identify his enemy,
Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:15.716 --> 00:59:16.758
Yes, Madam.

00:59:16.841 --> 00:59:18.300
Wah On?

00:59:23.466 --> 00:59:24.591
Madam.

00:59:24.716 --> 00:59:25.633
What's the matter?

00:59:25.716 --> 00:59:28.425
I talked too much yesterday
that my muscle hurts.

00:59:28.716 --> 00:59:31.425
Identify this guy.
Tell me if he is Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.716
All right.

00:59:36.716 --> 00:59:38.341
It's you.

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.216
How can you recognize me?

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.966
-I definitely know you. You are Tong--
-Right.

00:59:43.175 --> 00:59:46.300
I am the one Tong Pak-fu wanted to kill!

00:59:46.508 --> 00:59:48.300
If you don't want to die,
you'd better shut up.

00:59:48.383 --> 00:59:51.758
Madam, Tong Pak-fu is always masked
when he does bad things.

00:59:51.841 --> 00:59:53.841
I am not very sure.

00:59:54.341 --> 00:59:56.341
Well, don't miss out on this chance.

00:59:56.466 --> 00:59:58.050
-Kill him.
-Hold it.

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.925
He must be somebody to Tong Pak-fu.

01:00:02.008 --> 01:00:04.425
So why not let him live?
Maybe we can get Tong Pak-fu by using him.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.216
Well, I can let him live,
but with severe punishment.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.883
Shek-lau, lock him up in the storeroom.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:12.466
Torture him as you like.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.925
Thank you, Madam.

01:00:15.008 --> 01:00:17.091
-What do you want?
-Bring him in.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.175
Don't touch me. I am still a virgin.

01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:25.925
How enjoyable!

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:37.425
Do you want to kill me
to keep your secret?

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:39.633
Shut up. You'd better run for your life.

01:00:39.716 --> 01:00:40.925
No, I don't want to leave.

01:00:41.175 --> 01:00:44.175
I have good food here

01:00:44.258 --> 01:00:46.466
and I get to sleep with a wonderful woman.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.716
Are you kidding?

01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:49.966
I mean it. I owe the loan sharks
too much money.

01:00:50.133 --> 01:00:52.175
-This is the best place for me to hide.
-You...

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:53.591
Someone is coming.

01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:03.383
Are you all right?

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.966
What's the matter, Ms. Chou-heung?

01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:08.466
Are you Tong Pak-fu?

01:01:09.175 --> 01:01:10.883
Why do you ask me this question?

01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:15.341
Actually, I admire Tong Pak-fu very much.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:17.175
I want to meet him.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.675
Please tell me the truth.

01:01:23.966 --> 01:01:26.341
Right, I am Tong Pak-fu.

01:01:28.175 --> 01:01:29.425
What noise is it?

01:01:29.716 --> 01:01:31.300
It's the noise of some animals.

01:01:32.175 --> 01:01:33.425
Shut up.

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.133
Chou-heung.

01:01:38.091 --> 01:01:40.341
It's fated for us to meet.

01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:43.633
Let's have a long chat.

01:01:46.008 --> 01:01:49.133
May I ask you a question?

01:01:49.966 --> 01:01:51.133
Sure.

01:01:52.216 --> 01:01:54.591
But to show that you are sincere enough,

01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:57.050
you have to answer a question first.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:01.925
Close your eyes.

01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:05.841
Relax.

01:02:08.008 --> 01:02:12.258
Put your head on my left shoulder.

01:02:14.425 --> 01:02:17.341
Don't be nervous. Don't you trust me?

01:02:20.175 --> 01:02:22.300
Relax.

01:02:23.216 --> 01:02:26.383
Let your face touch mine slowly.

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.925
Right, good girl.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.966
-I cannot stand this anymore.
-Hey, I am coming.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.341
Somebody is coming.

01:02:48.341 --> 01:02:49.258
Miss, who are you?

01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:52.758
Don't you remember me?
You just slept with me!

01:02:53.425 --> 01:02:56.466
I am a civilized man.
What are you talking about?

01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:59.300
You tried very hard just now.

01:02:59.716 --> 01:03:01.425
But there was no one else.

01:03:01.508 --> 01:03:04.591
What? I don't care.
I want to play a game with you now.

01:03:04.841 --> 01:03:06.883
The Beauty and the Beast!

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.966
I know Tong Pak-fu now.

01:03:10.966 --> 01:03:12.675
Wah On is even better than him.

01:03:13.008 --> 01:03:14.591
Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

01:03:15.175 --> 01:03:16.591
Why are you here?

01:03:17.258 --> 01:03:19.591
I came to watch something. How about you?

01:03:20.008 --> 01:03:21.133
Me too.

01:03:21.341 --> 01:03:22.716
Let's watch together.

01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:25.925
This is great.

01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:27.300
Really?

01:03:29.966 --> 01:03:33.758
Do you think I am nothing?

01:03:36.633 --> 01:03:39.300
-Once more.
-I'll give you more!

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:42.716
-Move.
-Move.

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:06.925
Your Excellency,
King Ning is coming with a troop.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.675
Dear, His Majesty always goes against you.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.425
In the government meeting,
you are his political enemy.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:18.300
He is bringing his troop here.

01:04:18.425 --> 01:04:19.966
I'm afraid he has some tricks
up his sleeve.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.091
We should be careful.

01:04:22.175 --> 01:04:23.966
Here comes King Ning.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.175
How are you?

01:04:33.508 --> 01:04:36.883
Thank you for visiting us.

01:04:37.466 --> 01:04:38.758
I heard

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:41.633
you love Chinese paintings very much.

01:04:41.758 --> 01:04:46.258
I tried very hard to find
Tong Pak-fu's paintings for you.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:47.258
Your Majesty.

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.258
Enough. Bring me the paintings.

01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:51.425
Yes.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:55.758
It's really vivid! What a nice painting!

01:04:55.841 --> 01:04:58.758
Right? It's so great!

01:04:59.216 --> 01:05:00.800
I have remounted it.

01:05:01.341 --> 01:05:04.050
Look at the king of the birds.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.716
It looks as if it is alive.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:08.800
It really is the king of the birds.

01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:13.716
How could I accept such a precious gift?

01:05:14.008 --> 01:05:15.675
If you don't, you're not giving me face.

01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:16.841
Do you want me to get mad?

01:05:17.258 --> 01:05:18.508
Don't get mad.

01:05:19.425 --> 01:05:23.300
I want to have a look at the painting too.

01:05:23.466 --> 01:05:26.258
All right. Since you love paintings too,

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:27.841
have a look.

01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:34.758
Chou-heung, come and have a look.

01:05:34.966 --> 01:05:36.216
Yes, Madam.

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:41.383
This is <i>Peacock</i> painted by Tong Yan.

01:05:41.508 --> 01:05:43.508
But a peacock
is an ordinary bird after all.

01:05:43.675 --> 01:05:47.341
Even though you have remounted it,
it won't help.

01:05:47.675 --> 01:05:49.133
After all, an ordinary bird

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.300
can't become a phoenix.

01:05:52.466 --> 01:05:55.050
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

01:05:55.258 --> 01:05:57.216
She is still new
in studying about paintings.

01:05:57.341 --> 01:05:58.883
Please forgive her ignorance.

01:05:59.633 --> 01:06:01.800
Your Majesty, since they're experts
in Pak-fu's paintings,

01:06:01.883 --> 01:06:05.675
they must have kept
better paintings of Tong Yan here.

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:07.633
You are right.

01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:10.466
Madam, why don't you show me
the paintings of Tong Yan?

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.008
Frankly, we don't have
any of Tong Pak-fu's paintings.

01:06:13.716 --> 01:06:16.175
Goodness, you are fooling His Majesty.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.758
-Your Excellency.
-Your Majesty.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:21.841
Tong Pak-fu is now
staying in our guest room.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.008
Chou-heung, please bring Tong Pak-fu here.

01:06:25.133 --> 01:06:26.216
Yes, Madam.

01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:34.133
Madam, here comes Tong Pak-fu.

01:06:34.425 --> 01:06:35.466
Tong Pak-fu.

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:38.216
I want you to draw a picture of a phoenix

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.800
for His Majesty.

01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:43.550
All right. I want to know

01:06:43.758 --> 01:06:45.133
how nice your phoenix is!

01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:47.550
If you can't draw a nice phoenix,
you might be killed.

01:06:47.675 --> 01:06:49.591
Tong Pak-fu, draw it now.

01:07:00.008 --> 01:07:01.508
It's done.

01:07:06.341 --> 01:07:08.258
Look, this is <i>Holy Phoenix</i>.

01:07:10.258 --> 01:07:12.633
What? It's only a chick.

01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:15.133
Something is missing.

01:07:15.633 --> 01:07:17.466
A halo, right here.

01:07:20.008 --> 01:07:21.050
Look, isn't it holy now?

01:07:21.133 --> 01:07:23.258
Gosh, how dare you fool me!

01:07:28.716 --> 01:07:31.591
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I've always known he wasn't Tong Pak-fu.

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:34.675
Now, we've found out the truth
from his painting.

01:07:34.758 --> 01:07:36.341
-Take him out.
-Yes.

01:07:39.758 --> 01:07:41.716
I heard you are great at writing poems.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.675
My consultant wants to learn
something from you.

01:07:44.966 --> 01:07:47.300
No, the others will tease
Our Excellency of bullying your people.

01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:48.300
Right.

01:07:48.383 --> 01:07:50.383
There's no such thing
as ranking in literature.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.091
This is just for fun.

01:07:52.466 --> 01:07:55.800
If you don't accept this challenge,
I'll lose my temper.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:57.591
Begin!

01:07:57.675 --> 01:08:01.383
A for apple and B for boy.
C for cat and D for dog.

01:08:01.466 --> 01:08:04.466
E for egg and G for girl.

01:08:04.716 --> 01:08:06.716
Come on, continue it.
Are you not giving me face?

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.550
I will lose my temper!
Don't make me angry.

01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:09.966
Please let me try.

01:08:10.758 --> 01:08:14.966
Doe, a deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.883
Me, a name I call myself.
Far, a long, long way to run.

01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:20.966
Great distich!

01:08:22.008 --> 01:08:25.341
-Wah On, you came in time!
-It's all right. Don't worry.

01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:30.300
I am the consultant of His Majesty,

01:08:30.425 --> 01:08:33.800
The Number One Distich Writer,
Tu Chuen-chang.

01:08:36.175 --> 01:08:37.633
I have studied for two years.

01:08:37.758 --> 01:08:41.258
I am a servant here. Call me Wah On.

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:44.383
Okay. Let me play with you.

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:18.300
Sorry, we can't control ourselves.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.341
Let's start now.

01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:28.133
In pictures,

01:09:28.216 --> 01:09:30.383
the dragons and tigers won't roar.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.966
In chess,

01:09:33.175 --> 01:09:35.341
the horses and the generals can't fight.

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:37.716
Bravo.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:41.716
An A, a B, a C, and a D.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.466
An E, an F, a G, and an H.

01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:50.883
Wah On! You are a good distich writer!

01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:52.591
Raise another distich.

01:09:52.883 --> 01:09:55.591
See, a jerk standing over there.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:59.633
Here, a bastard is sitting before me.

01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:06.300
I am a hero on the battlefield.

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:09.341
You are a chicken in bed instead.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:13.925
I can't be embarrassed
in front of a small potato!

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.508
Let's plant the trees together.

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.925
For the grave of your father.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:20.966
My grandmother has prepared supper.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.216
My godfather has slept
with your grandmother.

01:10:25.175 --> 01:10:26.425
Bravo!

01:10:28.675 --> 01:10:30.341
Writing distich is for fun only.

01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:33.008
But why are you hurt
while playing this game?

01:10:33.091 --> 01:10:35.675
I wonder how powerful the words are.

01:10:37.383 --> 01:10:39.216
Wah On, it's fine here.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.008
-Go back and clean the floor.
-Yes, Your Excellency.

01:10:42.133 --> 01:10:46.091
Your Majesty, forgive my little servant.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.591
He stopped you from losing your temper.

01:10:50.675 --> 01:10:53.216
Fine. Evil Scholar.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.133
Bring the painting granted by the emperor
to show to Mr. Wah.

01:10:56.216 --> 01:10:58.133
-Yes.
-Let's look at it together.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:00.550
Please catch the painting.

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:02.633
Watch out.

01:11:04.216 --> 01:11:06.800
It's not convenient to look at it here.
Let's go over there.

01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:28.800
It's a precious painting.
You'd better keep it carefully.

01:11:29.675 --> 01:11:32.508
We have plenty of time!

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:50.008
Is Madam in danger?

01:11:50.091 --> 01:11:51.341
Let's go and take a look.

01:11:51.466 --> 01:11:52.591
All right, let's go.

01:11:53.133 --> 01:11:54.675
Madam, how are you?

01:11:57.508 --> 01:11:58.591
What's the matter?

01:11:58.716 --> 01:11:59.591
I won't tell you.

01:11:59.675 --> 01:12:00.675
Ms. Chou-heung.

01:12:02.841 --> 01:12:05.966
-I was punched three times.
-How ugly!

01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:08.508
I was beaten eight times.

01:12:10.216 --> 01:12:11.966
Someone is uglier than me at last!

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:13.675
Ms. Chou-heung, what happened?

01:12:15.591 --> 01:12:17.341
I was beaten over 30 times.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.008
Ghost!

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:22.216
Ghost!

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.675
She's Chou-heung!

01:12:27.841 --> 01:12:29.591
Yes, she was seriously beaten.

01:12:29.716 --> 01:12:32.758
Did she get hurt by the most horrible...

01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:36.125
Yes, she got hurt from the Faceless Kick.

01:12:36.208 --> 01:12:39.208
Damn! She was kicked by me.
I thought it was a ghost.

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:40.833
Ms. Chou-heung.

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.458
-What have I done?
-You got hurt

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.625
by the most horrible Faceless Kick
and you were in danger.

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:06.208
Luckily, I saved you with my Beauty Fist
and returned you to normal.

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:08.333
You are fine now.

01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:11.291
-Thank you, Wah On.
-Don't mention it.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.291
-Wah On, is my face okay now?
-Your chin is still a little ugly.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:15.583
Use more force.

01:13:22.366 --> 01:13:24.533
Chou-heung, your pretty face is back!

01:13:30.801 --> 01:13:32.183
Madam!

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.166
Mr. Wah, I was so kind
to show you the painting.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:05.250
Why did you tear it?

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:07.916
Please don't be mad. I didn't mean to.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.083
Cut the crap.
You've ruined the royal treasure.

01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:11.458
I will report to His Majesty.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:13.708
He will execute your whole family!

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:15.416
Wait!

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:18.250
About the <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
you've just presented,

01:14:18.416 --> 01:14:20.708
I don't think it's the real one.

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:23.000
How dare you fool me?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.958
It was given by the emperor.
How can it be fake?

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:27.625
I am going to lose my temper.

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:30.708
Hold it. In fact, the real
<i>Spring and Autumn</i> is being kept here.

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:32.791
It has always been kept in our house.

01:14:33.416 --> 01:14:36.041
If you don't believe me, let me show you.
Chou-heung, follow me.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.416
Your Majesty.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.666
Fine, I want to know
what you are going to show me.

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:44.416
You'll be in deep trouble later.

01:14:46.041 --> 01:14:47.708
Wah On, what are you doing?

01:14:47.791 --> 01:14:50.208
How can we have the <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
drawn by Tong Pak-fu?

01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:51.666
What should we do now?

01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:53.208
Chou-heung, please bring me the ink.

01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:55.833
No, we have no choice. Get me the ink.

01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:58.750
-What?
-Get me some ink.

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:01.541
I have to draw it by memory.

01:15:02.333 --> 01:15:05.208
But it's hard to imitate
the painting of Tong Pak-fu!

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:09.083
I hope King Ning will be fooled.

01:15:09.416 --> 01:15:10.666
Impossible!

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:14.166
How will he get tricked by my painting?

01:15:14.666 --> 01:15:17.291
Wah On, you've messed up!

01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:21.000
You will be killed
and so will the Wah family!

01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:22.916
You'd better leave.

01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:26.458
Nobody is outside, go now.

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.083
-Did you paint it?
-Yes.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.000
I earned my living
by imitating Tong Yan's paintings.

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:42.750
I've imitated <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
a hundred times.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:44.041
Hopefully, it can save us.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.458
This is for me to survive,
so I have to carry it.

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:48.833
-How can you draw so fast?
-I was slow this time.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.925
This is the painting by Tong Pak-fu.

01:15:57.133 --> 01:16:00.050
How can you claim this is true?
What proof do you have?

01:16:00.358 --> 01:16:03.400
Why don't you ask the expert to check it?

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.358
Tu Chuen-chang.

01:16:08.975 --> 01:16:11.475
Are you still alive? If you are,
come and check out this painting.

01:16:12.975 --> 01:16:15.850
-Is this going to work?
-We'll have to take our chances.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:20.683
This is really drawn by Tong Yan.

01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:24.641
Are you kidding me? Impossible.

01:16:24.766 --> 01:16:26.141
Look carefully!

01:16:26.266 --> 01:16:30.016
It's true, but it's rather wet.

01:16:32.908 --> 01:16:34.908
The weather is misty, so it's wet.

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.283
Yes, it's misty.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.950
You may die now.

01:16:38.033 --> 01:16:39.491
Your Majesty, you are too careless.

01:16:39.658 --> 01:16:41.533
How could your painting get stolen?

01:16:41.658 --> 01:16:43.991
Maybe the emperor will execute you
after he finds out about this.

01:16:44.658 --> 01:16:47.325
But we are friends.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:48.916
Take this as my regard.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:51.333
Keep it safe!

01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:53.708
Otherwise, it may be stolen again.

01:16:54.441 --> 01:16:57.108
Your Majesty, we should leave.
He is difficult to handle.

01:16:58.608 --> 01:17:00.108
Fine, let's go.

01:17:01.391 --> 01:17:02.808
Hold it.

01:17:02.891 --> 01:17:05.266
You said you wanted to lose your temper.

01:17:05.516 --> 01:17:06.850
Remember?

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:08.749
Good. I'll show you.

01:17:15.216 --> 01:17:16.508
Are you scared?

01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:23.425
Why didn't you kill them?

01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:25.750
That servant is not that simple.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:27.166
I was almost trapped.

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.458
What do you mean?

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:32.250
Your kung fu is the most powerful
in the world, isn't it?

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:35.500
Why are you scared of a little servant?

01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:38.291
Your Majesty, my sword is powerful.

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.041
I was afraid it would hurt you.

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:42.583
You humiliated me.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:44.833
Your Majesty, I swear.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:46.916
In three days, after I recover,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.333
I will take revenge for you
and kill Mr. Wah.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.583
And his wife, Madam Wah.

01:17:52.916 --> 01:17:54.541
And the servant.

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:56.416
And Chou-heung.

01:17:56.916 --> 01:18:00.000
Anyway, kill them all!

01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:01.250
Yes, sir!

01:18:02.425 --> 01:18:04.300
-Brother, are you comfortable?
-Quite comfortable.

01:18:04.383 --> 01:18:07.800
Brother, you have a move
called Beauty Fist.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.050
Can you use that move to make us handsome?

01:18:11.133 --> 01:18:12.258
Yes, please beat us.

01:18:12.341 --> 01:18:15.008
But you are too handsome!

01:18:15.383 --> 01:18:17.300
But I don't mind being more handsome.

01:18:17.383 --> 01:18:19.758
-Right. Please give me some tea.
-Brother...

01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:23.533
Really? How can you talk like this?
It's our duty to serve you!

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.116
How can you mention the word "please?"

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:27.533
Don't you take us as your fellows?

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.116
The word "please" will disappoint us,

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.200
causing hormonal imbalance
and fecal incontinence.

01:18:31.283 --> 01:18:33.825
It will drive us crazy
and I might poop on your body.

01:18:34.133 --> 01:18:37.008
It's only a "please."
Don't you think you're a little dramatic?

01:18:37.238 --> 01:18:39.925
-Stop laughing. I'm serious.
-We're serious.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.050
Understood. You jerks, bring me some tea.

01:18:43.258 --> 01:18:45.675
-Right.
-Right. I love that, Brother!

01:18:45.758 --> 01:18:47.091
Thank you, Brother.

01:18:50.908 --> 01:18:52.033
-Mother.
-What?

01:18:52.241 --> 01:18:53.200
Where are you going?

01:18:53.283 --> 01:18:54.200
To get some tea.

01:18:54.283 --> 01:18:56.658
Get out. I have something
to say to Wah On.

01:18:57.241 --> 01:18:58.283
Okay.

01:18:58.825 --> 01:19:00.783
-Please be seated.
-After you, Madam.

01:19:01.366 --> 01:19:03.283
Wah On, you've done a lot for us.

01:19:03.366 --> 01:19:05.158
Here is a cup of ginseng tea.

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:06.908
Drink it. It's nutritious.

01:19:07.158 --> 01:19:09.408
-Wah On.
-Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

01:19:09.741 --> 01:19:11.408
You're welcome. Drink it while it's hot.

01:19:13.075 --> 01:19:14.408
You are educated.

01:19:14.533 --> 01:19:16.491
I think you should be recruited
by the government.

01:19:16.616 --> 01:19:19.158
Why are you serving in our residence?

01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:22.950
Madam, I don't care about
serving in the government.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.741
Moreover, you and Ms. Chou-heung
treat me so nicely

01:19:25.908 --> 01:19:28.908
that I wish I can stay
in the residence forever.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.158
What a wonderful scholar you are,

01:19:32.366 --> 01:19:34.450
Tong Pak-fu!

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:41.125
Are you talking to me?

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:42.291
Stop pretending.

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:46.083
From your kung fu and poetry,
I have guessed something.

01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:49.375
Although I hate your family very much,
you saved me yesterday.

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.916
I am very reasonable. I won't harm you.

01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:54.250
Just confess!

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.583
I am not, but even if I say yes,

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:59.583
I won't be able to do anything
if you really want to harm me.

01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:02.083
-Do you understand what I'm talking about?
-Yes, I do,

01:20:02.166 --> 01:20:04.208
but you still have to confess one day.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.500
Make it tomorrow.

01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:07.333
You are so cocky!

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:08.416
So what?

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:09.791
Fine.

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:12.833
I will marry Chou-heung off to you
if you confess.

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:14.375
-Madam.
-Really?

01:20:14.666 --> 01:20:16.458
You must keep your promise.

01:20:16.541 --> 01:20:17.375
That's right.

01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:22.041
I am the wise and handsome hero,
Tong Pak-fu.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.916
Madam.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.125
You are nosy.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.458
-Madam, you...
-I didn't keep my promise, so what?

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.625
I want you to die now!

01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:41.041
Hey, please stay calm. No weapons, please.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:42.916
Are you begging me?

01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.916
Tong Tin-ho, you heartless guy.

01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:48.375
I couldn't kill you,

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:51.500
but I can kill your son
to avenge my broken heart.

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:53.708
Don't blame me for being frank.

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:57.333
How can you kill me with these guys?

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:59.458
Are you kidding me?

01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:02.125
Let me tell you.

01:21:02.208 --> 01:21:05.583
The ginseng tea you just drank is poisoned

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:11.041
by something called
the Greatest Drug in the World.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:17.500
How can you claim it to be
the greatest drug in the world?

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:21.125
How about my Tong's Killing Pill?

01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:23.416
Bullshit.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.416
The Greatest Drug in the World
is made of seven venomous insects

01:21:26.541 --> 01:21:29.416
and arsenic trioxide,
under 49 days processing.

01:21:29.708 --> 01:21:32.750
It's tasteless and colorless.
No one can stay alive after taking it.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.375
My Tong's Killing Pill is made of honey,

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:37.166
fritillaria cirrhosa, and balloon flower,

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:39.208
plus snow lotus from Tin Shan.

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:42.125
No freezing
or preservative ingredients added.

01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:43.958
It's a powerful poison.

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:46.416
And it tastes good too.

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:51.583
You will lose your kung fu
after taking my drugs,

01:21:51.666 --> 01:21:55.833
and your blood will flow
in the opposite direction until death.

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:59.000
At last, you will explode and die.

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:02.541
Right, after eating
my Tong's Killing Pill,

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:06.416
you won't be able to move
even one step or smile.

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:09.708
Otherwise, your whole body will explode.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:12.083
It's so convenient.

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:13.625
To kill a person.

01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:16.041
-And it's easy to carry too.
-And it's easy to carry too.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:18.666
Where is it being sold?

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:22.416
You are lucky. I have one here.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.541
I don't think it's powerful.

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.708
No, my pill is the most powerful drug!

01:22:28.125 --> 01:22:30.000
What a joke! You are bluffing!

01:22:30.083 --> 01:22:31.666
You don't believe me?
Do you dare to take one?

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:34.291
-Do you think I'm afraid?
-I don't think you dare to take it.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.916
-Okay, I will take it.
-Go ahead.

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:37.750
-All right.
-Eat this.

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:39.416
How dare you challenge me?

01:22:39.541 --> 01:22:41.500
-Go ahead if you have guts.
-I have guts, of course.

01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:43.750
Watch me.

01:22:47.375 --> 01:22:49.833
Do you think I am an idiot? Eat this?

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.208
Eat this.

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:56.333
You are not stupid. You are very stupid.

01:22:56.958 --> 01:23:01.000
Now that we are all poisoned,
why don't we exchange antidotes?

01:23:01.208 --> 01:23:02.958
Damn you, are you threatening me?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:05.750
Madam, it's not worth to take the risk.
Your life is precious.

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:08.458
Hey, lock him up in the storeroom.
Let him die there.

01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:09.583
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:15.333
-Madam, please be merciful.
-Enough.

01:23:15.541 --> 01:23:19.208
Bullshit. I don't think
his poison can kill me.

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:21.541
If worse comes to worse,
I won't smile or walk.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:37.875
Chou-heung.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.041
Shut up.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.583
I have stolen many antidotes
from Madam's exercise room.

01:23:44.916 --> 01:23:47.250
See which one of these can save you.

01:23:47.541 --> 01:23:49.541
I appreciate that
you took the risk to save Wah On.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.208
Wah On?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.750
In fact, when you drew that painting,

01:23:56.375 --> 01:23:58.000
I've long known your identity.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.500
I didn't expect that
you would confess your identity.

01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:06.000
Chou-heung,
I have done all that just for...

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.625
I want to ask you a question.
Please answer me.

01:24:09.708 --> 01:24:10.833
What is it?

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.291
Is Tong Pak-fu your nickname?

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:16.250
No. Why do you ask?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.666
Pak-fu, Pak-fool...

01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.666
It's really funny!

01:24:28.166 --> 01:24:29.916
If you don't want to answer me,
just forget it.

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:31.000
Thank you.

01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:32.500
What color do you like?

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:35.750
Many colors. Let's say, yellow.

01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:38.375
Yellow? This color?

01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:39.625
Yes.

01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.375
That's why you always follow me.

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:46.041
Other than drawing,
what hobbies do you have?

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:48.041
Nothing special.

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:51.250
Just listening to music
or playing the flute.

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:54.958
-You know how to play the flute! Great!
-Yes.

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:57.416
-Let me teach you sometime.
-Okay.

01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:01.291
You are the leading scholar
of the Four Scholars.

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.416
Have you felt any pressure?

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.708
That's a good question.

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:09.041
It's a huge pressure.

01:25:09.208 --> 01:25:12.500
So I always have a trip
to reduce my pressure.

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:13.625
I understand.

01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:16.458
Did you invent the Tong's Killing Pill?

01:25:16.666 --> 01:25:20.291
-Of course not. I fooled Madam Wah.
-You are cunning!

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.708
Do you think she has found the antidote?

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:24.000
It's not here.

01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:26.041
So unlucky!

01:25:26.166 --> 01:25:28.958
I want to ask you,
are you scared of ghosts?

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:34.000
Tong Pak-fu is despicable.
He made me jump for a few days.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.875
Madam, since you're not poisoned,

01:25:37.125 --> 01:25:39.291
why don't you set him free?

01:25:39.416 --> 01:25:42.458
Chou-heung, if you weren't
my favorite maid,

01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:45.500
I would have kicked you out of my home.

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.875
Don't mention Tong Pak-fu again.

01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:49.916
-Madam.
-Get out of here.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I have served you for years.

01:25:55.125 --> 01:25:56.833
You've treated me nicely.

01:25:56.916 --> 01:25:59.083
I can't repay that with my life.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.458
Please forgive me

01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:05.333
because I'm going to beg you
to let Tong Pak-fu go.

01:26:06.416 --> 01:26:10.083
I wish to be punished
on behalf of Tong Pak-fu.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.333
Chou-heung, how dare you!

01:26:16.958 --> 01:26:18.375
-Chou-heung.
-Chou-heung.

01:26:19.333 --> 01:26:21.333
If you don't promise me, I won't get up.

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:22.666
-Madam!
-Madam!

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:25.750
I won't change my mind.

01:26:26.291 --> 01:26:27.541
Madam!

01:26:27.625 --> 01:26:29.625
What are you doing?

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:32.875
We are like sisters.

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:35.958
Please let Tong Pak-fu go
for the sake of Chou-heung.

01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:37.750
-Tung-heung.
-Please, we beg you.

01:26:37.833 --> 01:26:38.958
What do you mean?

01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:40.166
Drag them out.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.500
-Madam.
-Madam.

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:43.416
Mo Chong-yuen, where have you gone?

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:01.125
How dare you mess things up here!

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.416
Mr. Wah has offended His Majesty.

01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:04.916
You were lucky last time.

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:07.333
But I won't let you go now.
I want to kill your whole family.

01:27:07.416 --> 01:27:09.083
You are not qualified
to mess things up here.

01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:23.875
-Tung-heung, inform Mr. Wah now.
-Yes.

01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:28.916
Go.

01:27:30.583 --> 01:27:31.583
What's the matter?

01:27:31.875 --> 01:27:33.041
Follow me.

01:27:35.075 --> 01:27:36.325
What happened?

01:27:36.408 --> 01:27:38.783
-The Evil Scholar is here to kill.
-Evil Scholar?

01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:41.325
-You should go, it's dangerous out there.
-What about you?

01:27:41.408 --> 01:27:43.825
-Forget about me, go!
-Hey.

01:27:44.408 --> 01:27:45.783
Chou-heung.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.616
Madam means the world to me.
I'll stay with her no matter what happens.

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.908
Open the door first.

01:27:50.991 --> 01:27:52.325
-Wah On.
-What?

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:54.033
I love you.

01:27:54.116 --> 01:27:57.033
What did you say? Chou-heung!

01:27:59.016 --> 01:28:00.725
Go and help!

01:28:02.483 --> 01:28:03.816
Where are you going?

01:28:05.525 --> 01:28:07.441
Chou-heung, ask Wah On to help us.

01:28:07.525 --> 01:28:09.400
Only Wah On can help us.

01:28:09.566 --> 01:28:10.941
Wah On has left.

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:13.483
He is so disloyal!

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:17.483
Father, Mother has left.
Let's run for our lives.

01:28:17.566 --> 01:28:18.483
Sure.

01:28:20.358 --> 01:28:21.191
Madam.

01:28:21.275 --> 01:28:22.316
Madam.

01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:28.650
Madam.

01:28:28.858 --> 01:28:31.608
-Madam.
-How are you?

01:28:50.108 --> 01:28:51.233
Madam.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.691
-Wah On?
-He is Tong Pak-fu.

01:29:15.775 --> 01:29:17.650
Be careful! You're still poisoned.

01:29:17.858 --> 01:29:20.296
Don't worry, I got the antidote
from your exercise room.

01:29:20.566 --> 01:29:23.650
I took some time to take a bath
and get changed.

01:29:24.316 --> 01:29:27.275
Evil Scholar,
you tricked my father in the duel.

01:29:27.775 --> 01:29:29.733
Let's see if you can defeat me too.

01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:33.108
So you are the son of that poor fellow.

01:29:33.483 --> 01:29:35.483
That's why you look familiar!

01:29:35.608 --> 01:29:37.358
I have to avenge my father now.

01:29:37.566 --> 01:29:40.525
Tong's Spear should be number one
on the weapon list.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.875
Watch me.

01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:59.333
Your father was stupid, and so are you!

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:01.208
Why did you stab me without its head?

01:31:01.833 --> 01:31:04.458
But it's still powerful!

01:31:09.541 --> 01:31:11.750
I've made it powerful
even though there is no head.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:12.916
Now, die.

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:19.375
From now on, our Tong's Spear

01:31:19.458 --> 01:31:21.166
is the champion on the weapon list.

01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:23.083
Wah On, are you all right?

01:31:23.166 --> 01:31:24.541
I am fine, how about you?

01:31:24.791 --> 01:31:28.500
Great. I am so glad you came in time.

01:31:29.208 --> 01:31:32.458
Tong Pak-fu, I have to thank you
for saving our family.

01:31:32.541 --> 01:31:34.416
How can I reward you?

01:31:34.541 --> 01:31:36.958
You are welcome. I only have one request.

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:39.958
I know, you love Chou-heung, right?

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.666
I will marry her off to you.

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:43.125
Bravo!

01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:47.750
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.791
Why are there so many brides?

01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:56.833
Tong Pak-fu, although I promised
to marry Chou-heung off to you,

01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:59.500
there is one condition.

01:31:59.833 --> 01:32:03.833
Pick Chou-heung among the brides.

01:32:04.416 --> 01:32:05.500
Wah Man.

01:32:07.041 --> 01:32:10.625
"You should find her
before the incense burns out.

01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.166
There are several rules.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.916
First, stand behind the yellow line.

01:32:17.708 --> 01:32:21.250
Second, the brides

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.166
can't make any noise.

01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:28.125
Third, don't use anything
to touch the brides."

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.541
That's all.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.500
If you can't find Chou-heung
within the limited time,

01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:33.500
you'll lose.

01:32:33.875 --> 01:32:36.625
Then, Chou-heung will marry my sons.

01:32:36.791 --> 01:32:38.708
Brother, we are on the waiting list.

01:32:38.833 --> 01:32:40.125
Don't blame us.

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:44.750
Madam, please don't fool me.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:48.041
Mr. Tong, what do you mean?

01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:50.208
In such conditions,

01:32:50.416 --> 01:32:52.458
how will I be able to find Chou-heung?

01:32:52.916 --> 01:32:54.458
I can speak from my heart

01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:56.916
that I love Chou-heung wholeheartedly.

01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:59.416
Why do you have to trick me?

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:03.500
Tong Pak-fu, you said you were poor.

01:33:04.041 --> 01:33:06.166
You were willing to sell yourself
to be our servant.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.291
There was a contract too.

01:33:09.416 --> 01:33:11.750
But in fact, you came here
to court Chou-heung.

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:15.875
It's you who fooled us first.

01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:19.791
No! Read the first line of the contract
horizontally, please.

01:33:22.083 --> 01:33:23.416
"I came for Chou-heung."

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.291
Yes, I came for Chou-heung.

01:33:25.458 --> 01:33:26.750
I've told you why I was here.

01:33:26.833 --> 01:33:28.458
But you were not wise enough to read it.

01:33:28.875 --> 01:33:31.875
Don't be that cocky.
I want to fool you, so what?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Fool me? Why don't you go
and study for two more years?

01:33:34.125 --> 01:33:36.458
I'll take her away. What can you do?
No one can stop me.

01:33:36.541 --> 01:33:38.750
Go ahead and try.
This is the Wah's residence!

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.875
I'll ask His Excellency
to sue you in front of the emperor.

01:33:40.958 --> 01:33:42.458
You will be sentenced to death!

01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:44.375
Damn you, how dare you!
You are so shameless!

01:33:44.458 --> 01:33:45.583
How dare you scold me?

01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:46.916
Go to hell!

01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:49.250
Take it back.

01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:51.208
I won't forgive you.

01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:53.500
Come on.

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:54.750
You bitch! Don't pull me.

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:55.875
Mother.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:59.125
Stop or I will kick you to death.

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:00.750
Stop!

01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:05.291
Tong Pak-fu, Chou-heung is our maid.

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:07.125
If you want to marry her,

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:09.791
you should follow our rules.

01:34:09.958 --> 01:34:11.833
The incense is going to be burnt out.

01:34:12.291 --> 01:34:14.500
Think of something.

01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:18.375
Fine, I will try my best.

01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:20.375
I will find Chou-heung.

01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:24.208
Wonder World.

01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:45.791
Great Waves.

01:34:59.458 --> 01:35:02.833
First stance! Wonder Palm.

01:35:09.375 --> 01:35:10.458
Not this one.

01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:11.958
Once again!

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.416
Substitution.

01:35:24.666 --> 01:35:25.875
In double!

01:35:29.333 --> 01:35:30.208
Damn!

01:35:37.541 --> 01:35:39.208
Tong Pak-fu, are you dying?

01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:40.666
Wonder Palm?

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:42.416
Not exactly.

01:35:47.958 --> 01:35:50.041
It's you who is making me
use my last stance!

01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:04.166
Turtle Ball...

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.875
It's strong.

01:36:06.041 --> 01:36:07.125
Air...

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:09.416
He is so powerful!

01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:11.458
Is he Superman?

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:12.875
Stance!

01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:29.208
What the heck?

01:36:31.541 --> 01:36:32.916
Look, Tong Pak-fu.

01:36:33.125 --> 01:36:36.583
I have something
to fight against your stance!

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.416
Damn you, how dare you trick me?

01:36:38.625 --> 01:36:40.916
I love it, so what?

01:36:42.541 --> 01:36:43.833
Damn you, go to hell!

01:36:43.958 --> 01:36:45.750
No.

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:47.208
The incense is going to be burnt out.

01:36:47.291 --> 01:36:48.958
Chou-heung will marry my sons.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.125
Am I destined to be alone?

01:36:55.958 --> 01:37:00.500
My goodness.

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.875
"The people thought I was insane.

01:37:06.208 --> 01:37:08.375
But they don't really understand me.

01:37:08.916 --> 01:37:11.041
Can't you see the graves of the heroes?

01:37:11.916 --> 01:37:14.833
No flowers, no wine, but who cares?"

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.000
I know!

01:37:35.375 --> 01:37:36.541
Time's up.

01:37:36.625 --> 01:37:37.791
Right on time.

01:37:38.875 --> 01:37:40.125
Chou-heung.

01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:54.416
My goodness, why did you tremble
when I recited my poem?

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:58.250
I didn't! I just wanted to go
and take a leak.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:01.916
Do you have a knife?

01:38:02.291 --> 01:38:03.125
What for?

01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:04.333
I want to commit suicide.

01:38:04.458 --> 01:38:07.916
No, you have to marry me first.

01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:14.458
I prefer dying.

01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:21.083
Buddy, how dare you court my girl?

01:38:21.416 --> 01:38:22.833
Your girl is over there!

01:38:32.208 --> 01:38:33.333
Chou-heung.

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:35.583
Hurry and have the wedding now.

01:38:44.041 --> 01:38:47.625
Tidy up first. That's better.

01:38:47.708 --> 01:38:49.208
Kneel.

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:51.583
The wedding starts now.

01:38:53.875 --> 01:38:57.625
Chou-heung, after so many tests,

01:38:57.916 --> 01:38:59.875
I believe that
he loves you wholeheartedly.

01:39:00.166 --> 01:39:02.208
Now, I will let him marry you.

01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:03.916
Thank you, Madam.

01:39:05.666 --> 01:39:07.666
Tong Pak-fu, are you satisfied?

01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:09.708
What else do you want to say?

01:39:10.416 --> 01:39:13.875
What an interesting life!

01:39:14.166 --> 01:39:15.500
I want to go and take a leak.

01:39:15.625 --> 01:39:18.916
You're looking forward to
the first night with her, right?

01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:23.708
Tong Pak-fu, don't let us down.

01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:26.291
Treat Chou-heung well.

01:39:26.666 --> 01:39:28.791
Madam, I am sorry.
I have misunderstood you.

01:39:29.375 --> 01:39:31.166
You will always be our brother.

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.875
We wish you a long, happy life.

01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:34.750
Just like today!

01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:36.875
Thank you.

01:39:49.833 --> 01:39:54.958
Chou-heung, after so many difficulties...

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.583
We are married at last.

01:40:01.541 --> 01:40:04.333
Congratulations. You're really great!

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.333
Your wife is so pretty.

01:40:06.416 --> 01:40:09.166
Why don't you kiss your bride now?

01:40:09.666 --> 01:40:11.333
Come on.

01:40:11.708 --> 01:40:12.583
Hold it!

01:40:12.875 --> 01:40:14.250
Play a guessing game with me.

01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:16.000
You don't know how to play?

01:40:16.083 --> 01:40:18.333
How about mahjong,
Heaven and Nine, or Blackjack?

01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:20.000
You should know at least
one of these, right?

01:40:22.375 --> 01:40:26.208
THE END
