00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.858
TONG'S RESIDENCE

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.691
What's going on?

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:10.025
I've waited for six hours,
why hasn't he come out yet?

00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:13.566
Usually, he will come out
after four hours.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.941
-Put the rubbish in front of the door.
-Yes.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.941
-Let's fight for it.
-I saw it first.

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.608
Great!

00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.483
I have the painting of Tong Pak-fu.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.941
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:34.400
It's mine.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.758
-Master, isn't one dish of soy enough?
-Slowly, please.

00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:05.675
Many people came for your paintings.
Why don't you bother?

00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:07.550
I am in no mood to draw.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.216
Just give them two more
baskets of rubbish.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.300
Yes, Master.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.383
Mr. Chuck.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:13.601
Mr. Tong.

00:03:13.935 --> 00:03:14.810
Mr. Chuck.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:16.700
Help, Mr. Tong.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.716
I think you must have lost
all your money again.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.555
You understand me so well.

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:26.466
Everyone knows

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.633
you love gambling the most
among the Four Scholars.

00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:33.216
"Having no money to live comfortably."

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.679
That is your motto, right?

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:36.800
You are flattering me!

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.800
It's nothing compared to
your wild and unruly behavior.

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:41.508
In fact, you are much luckier than me.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.050
But you lose so much money every two days,

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.133
and you come to seek help from me
after losing money.

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:50.300
I don't think I can help you forever.

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:51.883
Sure!

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.258
Because of that,
I tried to risk it for the last time.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.466
But I lost all the money
I could lose until my death

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.300
which are 300,000 taels.

00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.758
So I need you to draw 30 pictures

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.883
-to save my life.
-Understood.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:04.883
Shui, go out first.

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:06.175
Yes, Master.

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:09.841
Damn you, do you think I owe you that?

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:11.425
You need 30 pictures? No way!

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:15.675
Please! It's my fault.

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:17.008
I am now begging you to forgive me.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:19.841
You should remember that I lent you
the porn magazine when you were a child!

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:22.550
Also, I always helped you
sell your paintings and made you rich!

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.258
Some loan sharks
are waiting for me outside.

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:26.216
They want me to get 30 paintings
of yours in 1 hour.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.091
Otherwise, they'll kill me!
Will you help me or not?

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.175
One hour?

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:33.300
Well, since you are my buddy,
I will write a lament for your funeral.

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.216
"A bastard" or "A scumbag",
which one do you like?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.341
Choose between these two.

00:04:37.175 --> 00:04:39.258
Pak-fu, don't be that mean to me.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:40.591
I swear.

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:41.966
If I gamble again,

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.675
I will be terribly assaulted
by an ugly woman until death.

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:46.716
Or until my penis becomes rotten.

00:04:46.883 --> 00:04:47.758
Is it okay?

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:51.050
You made such a terrible oath!

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.341
Okay, I will save you for the last time.

00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:56.133
Men, give me the stationery.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.050
You are such a heroic friend,
how righteous!

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:03.383
Cut the crap and undress.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:04.841
Undress?

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.883
What are you doing?

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:33.341
You can do this too?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.258
TONG YAN

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.175
Fantastic!

00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:47.841
It's worth being tortured!

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:48.925
What is it called?

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:52.925
It's great! It's called <i>Great Eagle</i>.

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.091
It's worth over 300,000 taels.

00:06:55.258 --> 00:06:56.425
Don't bother me again.

00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:59.466
Sure, but you amazed me.

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:01.716
You used my nipples to paint the flowers.

00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.508
You used my palms to paint the trees.

00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:05.008
My ass is used to paint the stones.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.300
Clouds and mountains are drawn
with my feet.

00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:09.050
As for the eagle,

00:07:09.133 --> 00:07:10.633
which part of my body is used?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.425
It's your penis.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.591
I guessed it correctly.

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.841
It's so vivid! How wonderful!

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:20.716
Your penis is used to paint
the little worm in the eagle's mouth.

00:07:21.091 --> 00:07:22.925
How wonderful can it be?

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:26.466
That's good.

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:28.091
It's useful anyway.

00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:31.800
<i>Tong Pak-fu was born
during the Ming Dynasty,</i>

00:07:31.966 --> 00:07:34.716
<i>in the Year of the Tiger.</i>

00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:35.883
<i>He was named Tong Yan.</i>

00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:39.091
<i>"Yan" means tiger in Chinese,
so he was named Pak-fu or First Tiger.</i>

00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:42.091
<i>He was very clever, and was good
at writing poems and painting.</i>

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:44.633
<i>He was the leading scholar
of the Four Scholars in Ming Dynasty.</i>

00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:47.508
<i>Tong Yan was the idol of many people.</i>

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:49.716
<i>He was envied by many men</i>

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:54.133
<i>because he had eight pretty wives.</i>

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:57.633
<i>He seemed to be
the luckiest guy in the world!</i>

00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.866
Hands up! Do you have money?

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.116
Please lend it to me first.

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:04.283
Are you kidding? You are so poor!

00:08:05.283 --> 00:08:06.158
Pay me now.

00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:07.866
I have money. I can keep on playing.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.783
Pay me now.

00:08:08.866 --> 00:08:10.575
You always win.
I wonder if you are a swindler.

00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:14.116
Of course! I'm so lucky!

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.283
Dear, come and eat the chicken wings!

00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:19.158
Why are you late?

00:08:19.283 --> 00:08:20.783
Hey, are you ready?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.491
We're ready.

00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:25.491
My <i>Hundred Flowers</i>!

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.991
Don't be so mean. We're just using it
as a temporary tablecloth.

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:31.741
You are not dying, so you can draw
another one anytime you like.

00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:34.200
-But--
-Cut the crap, play with me.

00:08:34.283 --> 00:08:35.908
Fortune, make it three. Why not thirty?

00:08:36.158 --> 00:08:37.033
Drink it!

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.575
-Hurry up!
-Let's start!

00:08:39.658 --> 00:08:40.575
Are you ready?

00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:43.366
<i>TONG YAN'S POETRY</i>

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.408
Gosh. What are you doing?

00:08:46.575 --> 00:08:47.408
My poetry!

00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:49.658
Look at this. The table is not balanced.

00:08:49.825 --> 00:08:52.283
One book is not enough.
Bring me two more, please.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.033
My first part is seven and eight, I win!

00:08:55.116 --> 00:08:56.575
My second part is two and five, I win!

00:08:56.658 --> 00:08:57.825
Again?

00:08:59.325 --> 00:09:02.408
Why is a bird missing from my painting?

00:09:02.616 --> 00:09:04.950
Cut the crap!
I lost a bird from my mahjong tile.

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.950
So I cut out the head to replace it.

00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:08.408
You shouldn't be surprised!

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:11.366
You...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.825
Mother, what are you doing?

00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:19.408
I want to commit suicide!

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:21.116
Go and take a look at her now.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.408
Hold it, let's finish this first.

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:24.241
Watch me, I am the winner.

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:25.658
You jinx!

00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:27.116
Money, please.

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:29.408
Mother, are you crazy?

00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.366
I am useless.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.241
I've married you to eight wives,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.033
but you aren't satisfied.

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:37.700
You always have a long face.

00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:40.325
I think I have to kill myself
because I am ashamed!

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:42.158
Why do you say so?

00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:44.116
I've never blamed you!

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.283
Pak-fu.

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:49.325
You are young and successful.

00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:52.991
You are rich and you have so many wives.

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:56.241
You should be
the happiest guy in the world.

00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:58.533
I never said I was unhappy.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:00.950
Then why the long face?

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.450
Is it because you think
they don't deserve you?

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:05.325
It's easy to get a wife,

00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.783
but it's not easy to get
a wife who understands me.

00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:10.033
Although they are my wives,

00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:12.450
they don't really understand my mind.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.283
You don't like us?

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.325
We'd better commit suicide then!

00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:22.950
What?

00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:24.783
Eight of you
will hang yourselves together?

00:10:24.908 --> 00:10:27.075
How amazing!

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:28.991
Help!

00:10:29.283 --> 00:10:32.408
Daughters-in-law, are you all right?

00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:33.616
Pak-fu.

00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:37.408
Do you want them all to die?
Will you feel happy about that?

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:38.366
I don't mean...

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.658
Let me go, I want to die.

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:41.908
Don't do that!

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.575
-Mother, let us die.
-Mother, let us die.

00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:46.325
-Just let us die.
-Just let us die.

00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:48.950
Pak-fu, can you say something?

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.741
Shut up.

00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:56.575
It's my fault.

00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:02.033
All of you are very nice,

00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:04.366
educated and civilized.

00:11:04.616 --> 00:11:06.283
I should have appreciated that.
It's my fault.

00:11:06.408 --> 00:11:09.075
I am sorry, please forgive me.

00:11:09.325 --> 00:11:11.658
-I am glad about that!
-I am glad about that!

00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:12.866
Dear.

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:15.575
-Smile.
-Come on.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.616
-Come on, smile.
-Right. Come on, smile.

00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:24.533
Why don't you laugh happily?

00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:25.700
You should laugh happily!

00:11:25.783 --> 00:11:27.866
-Come on, be happy.
-Come on, be happy.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.241
Show us a happy look.

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:42.491
-Fortune, make it two, why not eight?
-Four and four, you lose!

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:45.158
Let's play. Pak-fu, see.
They always want you to be happy.

00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:46.533
Don't misunderstand them.

00:11:46.616 --> 00:11:48.908
Do you understand me?

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.283
Madam, King Ning sent someone here
to visit Young Master.

00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:52.825
-King Ning?
-King Ning?

00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:55.325
King Ning is planning a revolution.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.908
Does he want to recruit you?

00:11:58.741 --> 00:12:01.116
Anyway, just ask them to leave.
I don't want to see them.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.691
Madam, they...

00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:12.275
Where is Tong Pak-fu?

00:12:12.508 --> 00:12:14.675
Our Majesty wants him
to be his consultant.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.883
Ask him to come out now.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.466
I am sorry.

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.341
My son is very sick. He can't see you now.

00:12:20.508 --> 00:12:23.841
Please express our sincere thanks
to His Majesty.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.466
What a coincidence!

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.175
Those we want to recruit always get sick.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.675
But it has been predicted
by His Majesty already.

00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:33.716
He asked us to bring the physician here

00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:35.300
to check on his sickness.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.883
Madam.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.383
Tong Pak-fu.

00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:42.841
Hey, isn't he sick?

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.925
He was seriously sick.

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:48.841
But how can a patient get an appetite
to eat chicken wings?

00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:50.633
Yes, it's strange.

00:12:52.425 --> 00:12:54.800
It's simple because...

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:59.675
<i>I love chicken wings</i>

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:03.216
<i>But your mother said you are going to die</i>

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.466
<i>That's why he has to eat more
Before he dies</i>

00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:10.800
<i>If he doesn't eat now
He'll have no chance to eat</i>

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:12.550
<i>Are you going to die?</i>

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.258
<i>I am going to die</i>

00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:16.508
<i>-If I don't eat now
-If I don't eat now</i>

00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:18.841
<i>-I will have no chance to eat
-I will have no chance to eat</i>

00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:22.591
But he doesn't seem to be seriously sick.

00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:24.925
Sir, check the pulse for Mr. Tong.

00:13:25.008 --> 00:13:26.425
See how serious his sickness is.

00:13:27.591 --> 00:13:30.383
His pulse is normal.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.466
I don't think he is sick.

00:13:47.383 --> 00:13:48.258
How is he?

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:50.133
-Can I be saved?
-Let me try.

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:05.883
What's wrong?

00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:08.508
I haven't experienced such a messy pulse.

00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:10.258
-What did you feel from his pulse?
-Music!

00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.258
What?

00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.716
I think you have to prepare
for your funeral.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.675
See you, Mr. Tong.

00:14:15.758 --> 00:14:18.466
We shouldn't have wasted our time.
Let's go.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.883
Sir, please save my...

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:24.008
Bastard, kneel.

00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:28.091
Do you remember you made an oath
in front of your father's grave

00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:30.800
that you will never show others
you know kung fu?

00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:33.091
Why did you show kung fu then?

00:14:33.175 --> 00:14:35.716
I remember, but it was an emergency.

00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:38.341
I just used my kung fu to change my pulse.

00:14:38.508 --> 00:14:40.591
But in case

00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:44.008
your secret is discovered by our enemies,

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.633
you will be in danger.

00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:49.716
Mother, who are our enemies?

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.508
Why don't you tell me?

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.341
I was afraid you'd look for trouble
if I told you when you were young.

00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:58.133
But you've grown up,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.716
so I should tell you anyway.

00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:03.758
We have two enemies.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.841
<i>One is called Evil Scholar.</i>

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:12.925
<i>He fought with your father</i>

00:15:13.008 --> 00:15:16.091
<i>for the ranking on the weapon list.</i>

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:20.091
<i>I was afraid he would play tricks,</i>

00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:22.216
<i>so I stayed and watched over their duel.</i>

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.300
Let me trap you instead.

00:15:31.758 --> 00:15:34.341
Mr. Tin-ho, you will win, don't worry.

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:51.425
Higher than you.

00:15:52.508 --> 00:15:53.550
Go to hell.

00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:58.216
What is it?

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.675
Chussy.

00:16:02.966 --> 00:16:04.216
Watch out.

00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:17.508
Go to hell.

00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:23.591
Chussy, you...

00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:25.675
Be careful!

00:16:34.508 --> 00:16:37.508
I have to use the last stance!

00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:40.091
Go to hell.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.550
Chussy, what the hell are you doing here?

00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:53.383
Be careful!

00:16:53.466 --> 00:16:56.383
Don't go! You should tell me
what you are doing here.

00:16:56.591 --> 00:16:58.758
I love you, so I want to help you.

00:16:58.883 --> 00:17:01.216
Do you think the red beans can help me?

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.550
They are not red beans.

00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:04.716
It's my new invention, the Tiny Bombs!

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.091
What? Tiny?

00:17:07.216 --> 00:17:10.425
Don't look down upon it.
It's really powerful when it explodes.

00:17:10.508 --> 00:17:13.716
What? Powerful what? It will explode?

00:17:18.216 --> 00:17:21.800
Damn you, Chussy. You want to play tricks?

00:17:23.758 --> 00:17:25.383
The Killing Sword Stance
of the Evil Scholar?

00:17:26.133 --> 00:17:27.925
In the most critical moment,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.633
your father attacked him

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.216
with the most horrible weapon
in the world.

00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:37.216
He turned the whole situation around.

00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:39.008
Watch out.

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.216
My Wonder Spear!

00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:52.508
Where is the spearhead?

00:18:00.675 --> 00:18:01.716
Why?

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.633
That's why Father died in great sorrow.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.341
He didn't expect Evil Scholar's Sword
to ruin the steel-made spearhead.

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:11.341
Before his death,

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.800
he made an invincible spearhead!

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.800
He was worried that the Evil Scholar
would kill the whole family.

00:18:17.883 --> 00:18:19.633
How about the other enemy?

00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:21.133
Who is the next one?

00:18:21.216 --> 00:18:24.091
She was your father's girlfriend.
She fought with me for him.

00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:25.591
But she got married later.

00:18:25.675 --> 00:18:28.133
I don't think you will meet her.

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.675
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:32.216
Don't distract me from gambling.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.591
Mother, I want to leave home

00:18:34.675 --> 00:18:35.716
for a few days.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:38.466
I am afraid the people with King Ning
will come and bother us.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.050
You should bring along the invincible
spearhead with you, just to be safe.

00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:44.633
Remember.

00:18:45.675 --> 00:18:50.133
-Let's play.
-Come on!

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.216
Since your father lost the duel,

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:54.341
Evil Scholar's Sword is ranked second

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.633
on the weapon list.

00:18:56.716 --> 00:18:58.758
Our Tong's Spear is ranked third.

00:18:58.883 --> 00:19:01.050
Siu Lee's Dagger is ranked fourth.

00:19:01.216 --> 00:19:02.175
Move!

00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:05.675
Who is the champion?

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:10.008
The mother of Siu Lee's Dagger,
but she passed away.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.675
What a pity.

00:19:14.091 --> 00:19:16.508
Cut the crap. Play with me.

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.883
Fortune, bingo. Make it six.

00:19:18.966 --> 00:19:19.883
Drink.

00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:23.091
You are too poor to compete with me.
Get lost, I want to play with Mother.

00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:27.758
-Fortune, make it three. Why not nine?
-Fortune, make it three. Why not nine?

00:19:28.008 --> 00:19:29.466
You lost. Drink.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.966
I am not scared.

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.966
Come on, bet now.

00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:48.091
Fortune, four and four...

00:19:48.216 --> 00:19:49.633
You lost, drink.

00:19:49.716 --> 00:19:52.883
<i>I am so miserable</i>

00:19:53.175 --> 00:19:56.050
<i>My wives are abnormal housewives</i>

00:19:56.216 --> 00:19:59.258
<i>But others envy me so much</i>

00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:04.550
<i>In fact, I am lonely</i>

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.675
Look, the Four Scholars are over there.

00:20:12.758 --> 00:20:15.258
Go and have a look, hurry.

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:54.466
You can never escape.

00:20:54.841 --> 00:20:57.008
Pak-fu, it's crowded.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.591
We came here for a tour.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.758
That's why the women are that crazy.

00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:04.800
That's why!

00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:08.300
Why don't we have a poetry competition?

00:21:08.383 --> 00:21:09.550
Good idea!

00:21:09.633 --> 00:21:11.175
Why don't you start first, Man-bun?

00:21:11.258 --> 00:21:12.258
I am good in this field.

00:21:13.216 --> 00:21:14.800
There are many geese under the mountain.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.466
They rushed down to the river.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.341
Let's roast a goose.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.175
After eating, go home
and play with your wife.

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:25.800
Good, very good.

00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:27.008
Very good.

00:21:30.008 --> 00:21:31.925
Is it that funny?

00:21:32.966 --> 00:21:35.966
Why is he always so happy
when he is on a trip?

00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:40.758
I envy him so much.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:44.550
He is so good

00:21:44.716 --> 00:21:46.008
at writing poems.

00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:48.508
And he is an excellent artist.

00:21:48.633 --> 00:21:51.050
He is really great!

00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:52.966
And he is good

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.133
at playing music too.

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:59.216
Right, I know how to play

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.008
all kinds of musical instruments.

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:02.550
I have studied a new kind of music.

00:22:02.633 --> 00:22:04.841
It's great.

00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:07.425
Let's play it together
if we have a chance.

00:22:07.508 --> 00:22:12.300
-I love it.
-But I envy you because of your wives.

00:22:12.466 --> 00:22:14.175
All your wives are pretty.

00:22:14.258 --> 00:22:17.966
I don't think

00:22:18.216 --> 00:22:22.008
you will have any regrets in your life.

00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.966
I envy you so much.

00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:27.133
Bravo.

00:22:30.466 --> 00:22:31.841
There is something attractive.

00:22:33.175 --> 00:22:35.258
Look, there is a beauty.
She seems to be lonely.

00:22:35.341 --> 00:22:38.425
Why not show us

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.508
how to court a girl?

00:22:41.675 --> 00:22:44.508
Let us learn!

00:22:44.758 --> 00:22:45.800
Well...

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.800
It's like a charity for your friends.
Will you do that for us?

00:22:49.883 --> 00:22:51.050
I am glad to demonstrate.

00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:52.258
Go.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.050
Miss.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.133
What's the matter?

00:23:24.925 --> 00:23:26.508
-Go.
-Go.

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:34.841
May I put my head on your shoulder?

00:23:35.091 --> 00:23:37.508
No, I am a girl. A decent girl.

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:41.466
I know, I want to make
my friends happy, that's all.

00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:43.800
I am Tong Pak-fu.

00:23:43.883 --> 00:23:46.175
So what? I don't know you.

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:47.966
I'll scream for help
if you don't leave me alone.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.258
How about I'll pay you one tael?

00:23:50.508 --> 00:23:52.216
Who do you think I am?

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.341
Make it ten.

00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:55.633
That's too expensive.
Why don't you just rob me?

00:23:55.841 --> 00:23:57.216
Right, I am a robber.

00:23:57.341 --> 00:23:58.633
Give me all your money.

00:24:01.633 --> 00:24:02.675
Go to hell.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.716
Go to hell.

00:24:05.633 --> 00:24:06.800
What's wrong?

00:24:10.925 --> 00:24:13.050
Did you really need to make
a serious punch like this?

00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:14.925
A robber! It's a ladyboy!

00:24:15.633 --> 00:24:16.675
-A ladyboy?
-A ladyboy?

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.175
I love that. Hold this.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.508
He is faster than me! Damn it.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.508
Look, so many people!

00:24:49.591 --> 00:24:52.133
Yes, it's crowded.

00:24:52.216 --> 00:24:55.008
Chung-heung, Ha-heung,
shut up and behave yourself.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.216
What's going on?

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.175
Excuse me.

00:25:06.258 --> 00:25:09.591
Madam Wah and her four pretty maids
have come to pray.

00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:11.800
The maids are all pretty.

00:25:11.883 --> 00:25:13.383
Especially Chou-heung.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.050
Who is she? Who is Chou-heung?

00:25:15.133 --> 00:25:16.258
Look! That way.

00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:18.216
Chou-heung.

00:25:31.258 --> 00:25:32.675
Damn, she is not pretty at all.

00:25:32.758 --> 00:25:34.133
You know,

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.633
a pretty woman is like a flower.

00:25:36.716 --> 00:25:39.133
You'll be all eyes for her beauty
when some leaves are around.

00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:40.258
Look once more.

00:25:40.883 --> 00:25:42.716
-Pretty woman!
-Pretty woman!

00:25:46.758 --> 00:25:49.050
She is really pretty!

00:25:49.133 --> 00:25:50.258
Let's go to the temple together.

00:25:50.341 --> 00:25:52.050
-To look for fun!
-To look for fun!

00:25:57.341 --> 00:25:58.508
You will be our leader!

00:25:58.591 --> 00:25:59.716
Follow me.

00:26:01.633 --> 00:26:02.841
-Give me.
-Give me.

00:26:02.925 --> 00:26:06.425
Go away, go that way!

00:26:06.841 --> 00:26:09.050
Move aside.

00:26:09.925 --> 00:26:12.716
Let's make use of any chance
to take advantage.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.883
Sure.

00:26:14.216 --> 00:26:15.508
Give the beggars some bread.

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.133
-Yes, Madam.
-Yes, Madam.

00:26:23.508 --> 00:26:25.008
-Give it to me.
-Give it to me.

00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:27.883
Go.

00:26:27.966 --> 00:26:28.925
Go!

00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:30.341
Be merciful!

00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:33.883
Any kind of bread will do! Come on!

00:26:36.758 --> 00:26:39.716
It's yours, everyone will get his share.

00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:47.091
Don't fight for it. It's yours.

00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:51.008
Madam, this is for you.

00:26:51.258 --> 00:26:55.675
Help! I am damn hungry!

00:26:59.175 --> 00:27:01.008
Are you hungry? Eat this.

00:27:02.466 --> 00:27:04.133
What? Is one not enough?

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:07.925
One more for you.

00:27:12.383 --> 00:27:14.633
Come over, here's some bread.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.633
Be good. Come on, eat this.

00:28:01.883 --> 00:28:04.591
<i>I've got it. The prettiest smile</i>

00:28:04.675 --> 00:28:06.300
<i>is a smile with love.</i>

00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:08.466
<i>I have found my dream lover.</i>

00:28:10.508 --> 00:28:11.675
<i>She is Chou-heung.</i>

00:28:44.091 --> 00:28:45.966
Miss, are you here to worship God?

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:50.591
It's good to worship God.
You will be blessed.

00:28:51.216 --> 00:28:52.466
Let me do it for you.

00:28:59.925 --> 00:29:01.300
To worship God...

00:29:08.675 --> 00:29:10.591
KEEP QUIET

00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.716
Hey, chase after the boat of Madam Wah.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.758
Fine.

00:29:22.633 --> 00:29:24.008
Be careful.

00:29:27.383 --> 00:29:31.800
You are wise to choose my boat.

00:29:32.008 --> 00:29:33.716
My boat is the fastest one.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.675
Really?

00:29:35.383 --> 00:29:39.425
-Hey, your boat is sinking.
-Right, it's the fastest to sink.

00:29:39.758 --> 00:29:43.550
-What's wrong? I am in a hurry!
-I think you are chasing Chou-heung.

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:44.591
How did you know that?

00:29:44.675 --> 00:29:46.925
I have seen many of your kind.

00:29:47.008 --> 00:29:50.133
But it's useless to court her
outside Madam Wah's residence.

00:29:50.216 --> 00:29:51.383
What good idea would you suggest?

00:29:51.633 --> 00:29:54.216
You should go to Madam Wah's residence.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.008
-Suggest me some ideas, please.
-But it depends on your offer.

00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:58.258
All right.

00:29:58.341 --> 00:29:59.591
Listen.

00:30:06.716 --> 00:30:07.550
Hey.

00:30:07.716 --> 00:30:09.925
You can't move. Got it?

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.550
Don't try to trick me. You should pay me!

00:30:12.633 --> 00:30:14.383
How can I trick a wise guy like you?

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.550
That's right.

00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:22.550
Cheap man! A brand new cheap man for sale.

00:30:22.633 --> 00:30:25.050
Come and have a look!

00:30:27.508 --> 00:30:28.675
I'm so poor!

00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:31.175
Hey, young man. Are you selling yourself
to bury your father?

00:30:31.341 --> 00:30:33.341
But it's unlucky to see a dead body
early in the morning.

00:30:33.425 --> 00:30:34.633
I didn't want to do this either.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.341
You look familiar.
Have I met you somewhere before?

00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:39.675
-Really?
-It doesn't matter, let's be friends.

00:30:39.758 --> 00:30:41.925
Why don't you be merciful? Buy me, please.

00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:43.175
What a pity.

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.883
We need a servant, why not...

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.508
I am poor.

00:30:48.591 --> 00:30:50.966
I am selling myself
to bury my whole family!

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.800
Are you kidding me?

00:30:57.091 --> 00:31:00.466
Be merciful.

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:03.383
My family died last night.

00:31:03.508 --> 00:31:08.258
I am sick. Why don't you buy me?
I will even make it half price!

00:31:08.883 --> 00:31:10.758
He is poorer.

00:31:10.966 --> 00:31:12.508
Why don't we buy him to be our servant?

00:31:12.716 --> 00:31:14.216
Let's buy him.

00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:16.883
Lady, first come, first served.
I came first.

00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:19.258
-It's not a problem of priority.
-Right.

00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:21.550
He has to bury six people,
but you only have to bury one.

00:31:21.758 --> 00:31:25.050
I want to help you, but it's difficult
for me to buy two people.

00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:26.383
But I am poor too.

00:31:26.466 --> 00:31:28.591
Show me how poor you are.

00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:29.758
Well, I...

00:31:30.758 --> 00:31:33.133
See how dirty my fingernails are?

00:31:33.216 --> 00:31:35.341
I'm very pitiful, right?

00:31:37.716 --> 00:31:39.841
Wong Choi.

00:31:40.008 --> 00:31:42.716
Wong Choi, don't die! Don't die.

00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:47.508
You have followed me for a long time.
You were so good to me.

00:31:47.883 --> 00:31:51.050
But I have never given you
sufficient food.

00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:53.841
I am really sorry.

00:31:57.383 --> 00:31:58.466
Watch out.

00:32:03.716 --> 00:32:06.175
Siu Keung, how are you?

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.175
Don't die, Siu Keung. Don't die.

00:32:08.383 --> 00:32:11.091
We have suffered for such a long time.

00:32:11.383 --> 00:32:14.966
I even treat you like my own relative.

00:32:15.258 --> 00:32:18.508
How can you leave me like this?

00:32:20.216 --> 00:32:22.550
Chou-heung, they are very poor.
What should we do?

00:32:22.883 --> 00:32:24.091
-Let's wait and see.
-All right.

00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:26.425
Damn!

00:32:27.883 --> 00:32:28.883
Hey, wait.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.133
Look at you. You look rich.
Why don't you go home and put on makeup?

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:35.841
Look at me. I am thin
and you can see the abscess on my arms!

00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:37.050
I am poorer.

00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:39.341
Buddy, don't challenge me.

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:40.508
So what?

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.216
-Are you pushing me?
-I am poorer, so what?

00:32:43.716 --> 00:32:44.800
Go to hell!

00:32:45.841 --> 00:32:47.466
Screw it!

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:52.050
Look, my arm is broken. Who is poorer now?

00:32:52.258 --> 00:32:53.425
Don't go too far!

00:32:53.591 --> 00:32:55.258
It's show-hand, so what?

00:32:56.383 --> 00:32:57.716
I'll play with you.

00:32:58.258 --> 00:32:59.550
Okay, I will show my hands too.

00:33:04.133 --> 00:33:05.300
Are you playing tricks with me?

00:33:05.466 --> 00:33:07.966
I don't want my life either.
Let's see how can you compete with me.

00:33:08.475 --> 00:33:11.350
Who is poorer?

00:33:14.266 --> 00:33:16.641
Bravo! You are really great.

00:33:16.725 --> 00:33:18.975
Hey, he is dead. I can buy you now.

00:33:19.058 --> 00:33:20.225
-Really?
-Right.

00:33:20.308 --> 00:33:22.433
-Another five taels.
-How can you suddenly raise your price?

00:33:22.516 --> 00:33:25.683
I want to bury him too.
You are so kind. Let's buy him.

00:33:26.058 --> 00:33:30.141
Shek-lau, we have to ask
for Madam's permission first.

00:33:30.558 --> 00:33:32.850
-Come again early tomorrow morning.
-I'm going to ask Madam now.

00:33:33.592 --> 00:33:35.800
Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

00:33:39.491 --> 00:33:41.450
Such a seducing smile!

00:33:41.575 --> 00:33:43.241
Mother, I did it.

00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:48.625
<i>Since you are so kindhearted,
I'm now buying you to be a servant.</i>

00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:50.250
<i>For six years. Any problem?</i>

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:51.250
<i>No problem.</i>

00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:53.625
<i>-Sign the contract now.
-I am signing it.</i>

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:04.333
Mo Chong-yuen has arrived.

00:34:04.983 --> 00:34:06.066
Why don't you squat?

00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:11.000
Kid, from today onwards,
you are a servant here.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.416
9527 is your number. Start working.

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:17.750
-Life is difficult.
-Life is difficult.

00:34:17.833 --> 00:34:19.666
But you have to smile
even when you are scolded.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.208
Life is difficult.

00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:25.250
You have to smile
even when you are scolded.

00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:28.208
-Life is difficult.
-Life is difficult.

00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:33.333
1001, 1002, 1003, 1004...

00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:36.291
How can you do this? Once more.

00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:37.958
One, two...

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:43.416
Hurry up.

00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:48.833
Roast it carefully.
Reserve the best part for me.

00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:50.208
It's time for dinner!

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:21.125
SERVANTS AND DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER

00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:25.958
Higher, fly it higher.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:27.458
It's fun.

00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:29.000
Here's a chance.

00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:36.166
It's cut!

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.125
-What should I do?
-What happened, miss?

00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:41.166
9527, get the kite down for us.

00:35:41.375 --> 00:35:43.875
-Right. Hurry up.
-I'm a low-ranking servant.

00:35:43.958 --> 00:35:45.250
I'm not allowed to enter this place.

00:35:45.375 --> 00:35:46.916
We don't treat you
as a low-ranking servant.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.625
I just treat you like a dog!

00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.583
-Go and get it, go!
-Go.

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:53.583
Up there.

00:35:54.583 --> 00:35:55.958
Ms. Chou-heung, nice to meet you.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.750
I didn't have a chance to thank you.

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:00.375
But it's destiny for us to meet again.

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:02.291
Don't worry about the kite.
I will get it for you.

00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:04.791
-Cut the crap. Go and get it now.
-Okay.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.625
-9527, be careful!
-9527, be careful!

00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:13.583
Thank you for your concern,
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:21.916
9527.

00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:26.375
What's wrong? Are you all right?

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.000
I am all right, but I broke my arm.

00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:32.000
You are too careless!

00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.625
I am scared of nothing

00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:37.708
as long as I can get the kite for you.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.833
It is just an arm. It's nothing.

00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:45.000
I am sorry. I have misunderstood you.

00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:48.541
Don't say that. Nobody is perfect.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.958
No!

00:37:00.541 --> 00:37:02.166
-Forget it.
-Don't go!

00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:13.791
-Great! They are lovers at last!
-Great! They are lovers at last!

00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:25.083
What is he laughing about?

00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:28.250
Let's see what he is doing.

00:37:28.666 --> 00:37:31.583
9527, what are you doing? Come down now.

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:33.708
Coming!

00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:40.125
Watch out!

00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:42.541
<i>Chou-heung, I am coming.</i>

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:47.708
I heard

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:51.125
that you have been drawing
pictures of her secretly, right?

00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:54.416
I have drawn many pictures.
Which one do you mean?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.708
Look at what he has drawn.

00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:06.375
How dare you! How dare you make
my beautiful goddess, Shek-lau,

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.208
so ugly in your picture?

00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:11.166
I am sorry.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.125
-Please give it back.
-You are not gifted at drawing.

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.250
You'd better quit!

00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:19.208
I must let you learn from my work!

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:21.708
This is called a drawing, look!

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.291
You are very great at drawing!

00:38:28.416 --> 00:38:29.416
I admire you so much!

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.291
Look!

00:38:35.416 --> 00:38:36.791
You know what a drawing is now?

00:38:36.875 --> 00:38:39.083
You are lazy
and you dare to fight with me for a girl.

00:38:39.166 --> 00:38:40.250
Beat him up!

00:38:42.375 --> 00:38:43.583
Stop fighting!

00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:45.708
Stop or I will inform Madam!

00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:46.958
Stop!

00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.500
I am giving face to Ms. Chou-heung.
Let's go.

00:38:51.791 --> 00:38:52.791
-Go.
-Go.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.875
Are you dying?

00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:00.166
Not yet, I won't die

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.583
until I give you back the kite,
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:06.125
Let's go.

00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:11.583
Not that easy! You broke our kite.
Let's beat him to death!

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:21.708
Luckily, I tried my best
to protect my face,

00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:24.375
so my handsome look is not ruined.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.791
I must tell her how much I love her.

00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:30.541
She will be touched!

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.625
Who dares to beat me?

00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:36.708
It's me. The prettiest woman, Shek-lau.

00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:39.500
It's you? Why did you hit me?

00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:41.000
Go to hell!

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:43.166
Why?

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.333
Why? Because you deserve it.

00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.833
Now everyone knows

00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:49.625
you have been drawing my picture secretly.

00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:52.416
How will I face others?
I am better off dead.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.500
-That's good.
-Of course you'd agree.

00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:57.458
You want to die with me
like Romeo and Juliet.

00:39:57.833 --> 00:40:00.166
Damn you, I don't like you at all.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.625
Ms. Shek-lau, you've misunderstood.

00:40:01.708 --> 00:40:04.333
In fact, I respect you so much.
I treat you like my mother.

00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:05.375
Mother?

00:40:05.583 --> 00:40:11.000
How could you fall for your mother?
Goodness, this is very bad!

00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:12.791
But it's very exciting.

00:40:13.125 --> 00:40:16.000
Come on, I've never experienced it.
I am a little bit nervous.

00:40:16.166 --> 00:40:17.916
-Come on, hurry up.
-Hey.

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:19.666
Are you crazy?

00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:21.583
Don't talk, do it now.

00:40:21.708 --> 00:40:25.166
Don't save your energy
because I am pretty and civilized.

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:29.625
How unlucky of me to meet such a hag!

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:31.416
Good!

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:36.041
Sir.

00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:39.583
Sir, we heard that the four maids
of Madam Wah are all pretty.

00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:42.333
Especially Chou-heung. She is very pretty!

00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:43.875
Chou-heung will go to our boss of course.

00:40:44.166 --> 00:40:45.375
-Sure.
-Sir.

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:46.833
How about this one? Should we kill him?

00:40:46.958 --> 00:40:50.416
No, he is one of us.

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.250
-Just knock him out.
-All right!

00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:56.000
You must be the famous
Four Perverted Heroes.

00:40:56.166 --> 00:40:59.041
Yes, we are the famous
Four Perverted Heroes.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.041
Fine. To be frank,

00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:06.291
I am the legendary, handsome, renowned,

00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:09.208
perverted Little Wolf, Chow Pak-tung.

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:10.958
-I haven't heard of your name!
-Hey.

00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:14.125
This little wolf is so fearless
that he assaulted this ugly woman.

00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:16.625
How could I reject the name Little Wolf?

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:17.583
She is nothing.

00:41:17.666 --> 00:41:19.083
There were girls who are worse than her.

00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:21.250
I respect you so much.
May I call you Senior?

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.500
You are flattering me!

00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:24.916
I heard that you want
to assault Chou-heung.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.875
That's right.

00:41:25.958 --> 00:41:27.666
If you don't mind,
let me bring you to her room!

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.208
Do you want to have a turn after me?

00:41:29.958 --> 00:41:31.541
-You first of course.
-Thank you.

00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:33.875
Clean your shoes. Don't leave any marks.

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:53.666
Where is Little Wolf?

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.041
Go get him to lead the way.

00:41:58.875 --> 00:41:59.958
CHOU

00:42:00.375 --> 00:42:01.416
Found it.

00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:07.416
9527, why are you here?

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:10.333
You're in big trouble!
Some rapists have come for you.

00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:15.250
I am scared. What should we do now?

00:42:15.458 --> 00:42:16.583
I have misled their way.

00:42:16.666 --> 00:42:18.750
This place is so big.
They won't find their way. Why not...

00:42:18.833 --> 00:42:20.333
What's wrong with your nose?
It's bleeding.

00:42:20.416 --> 00:42:21.833
The perverted thieves hurt me.

00:42:21.916 --> 00:42:23.208
It's nothing. No big deal.

00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:25.166
In order to save you,
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:27.750
You should hide first. Come with me.

00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.375
Just to be safe, let me take a look first.

00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:35.541
Never mind, I am fine.

00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:38.666
Stop, you are the perverted thief!

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:42.125
You may call me a thief,
but I'm not a perverted thief.

00:42:42.208 --> 00:42:44.125
You may call me a thief of love
because I steal hearts.

00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.625
I don't care what kind of thief you are.

00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:47.666
Stop playing tricks in front of me.

00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:49.541
It will make me hate you more.

00:42:49.666 --> 00:42:51.750
When you find out
that you are accusing me,

00:42:51.833 --> 00:42:53.333
you will feel sorrow and regret.

00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:55.541
-Follow me and hide first.
-Get lost.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.833
If there is a thief,

00:42:58.208 --> 00:43:00.708
why didn't you inform Madam,
but come here instead?

00:43:00.916 --> 00:43:04.125
Don't think that you can take advantage
of innocent girls.

00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:07.083
Let me tell you.
It's fine for a man to be poor,

00:43:07.166 --> 00:43:09.333
but he should be well-behaved.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.541
Although you are educated,
you are rubbish anyway.

00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:15.166
Great! I am a man.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.708
I should have beaten you to death
after hearing such insulting words.

00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:19.833
But I won't do that. Maybe you are right.

00:43:19.916 --> 00:43:21.916
-Maybe I am rubbish.
-Maybe more than rubbish.

00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:23.708
I have to call you a bastard.

00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:28.166
Good! But you hate me so much.

00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:31.875
Then why did you give me
those three affectionate smiles?

00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:35.708
Did I do that?

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:36.916
Look, you did it again.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.791
Even though I smiled at you,

00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.041
it is just to tease you
because you are an idiot.

00:43:46.166 --> 00:43:51.416
I see. It's only a misunderstanding.

00:43:52.416 --> 00:43:54.291
I'm sorry. I'm too stupid
to misunderstand your smile.

00:43:54.375 --> 00:43:56.500
But you are really in danger.
You'd better be careful.

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:01.750
Why are there so many useless men
in this world?

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:06.416
I wonder if Tong Pak-fu
is the only ideal man in this world.

00:44:07.125 --> 00:44:10.250
Only a romantic man
can write such a romantic poem.

00:44:10.583 --> 00:44:12.666
"The temple is located inside
the peach blossom garden.

00:44:12.875 --> 00:44:15.000
There is a fairy of peach blossom.

00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:17.791
The fairy of peach blossom
planted the peach blossom trees.

00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:20.666
She traded the flowers for sweet wine."

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:26.541
"The people thought I was insane.

00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:29.250
But they don't really understand me.

00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:32.083
Can't you see the graves of the heroes?

00:44:32.416 --> 00:44:35.125
No flowers, no wine, but who cares?"

00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.791
I love this poem!

00:44:45.166 --> 00:44:46.500
Why are you standing there?

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:48.875
You recited Tong Pak-fu's poem.

00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:50.708
In fact, it's an insult.

00:44:50.916 --> 00:44:53.041
You're not qualified to recite his poem.
Get lost now.

00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:54.333
Watch out, it's dangerous.

00:44:54.791 --> 00:44:58.000
Chou-heung, I finally understand.

00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:02.416
How dare you! You have gone too far.

00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:04.625
If you don't leave,
I won't give you a chance.

00:45:05.625 --> 00:45:07.208
Don't force me to use the last move.

00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.750
Chou-heung, you are too impulsive.

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:11.375
I don't blame you. You are still young.

00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:12.625
But I really love...

00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:14.791
Cross Killing Rod!

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.083
<i>I must tell you the truth.</i>

00:45:18.166 --> 00:45:23.708
Listen, I am Tong Pak-fu!

00:45:25.833 --> 00:45:27.000
Tong Pak-fu?

00:45:27.916 --> 00:45:28.875
Yes?

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:30.666
If you were Tong Pak-fu,
I would be the goddess!

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.666
Go to hell!

00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:36.875
It's so destructive!

00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:40.375
Little Wolf, you are really a pervert!

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.208
Wake up, Senior!

00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:43.500
"Senior"?

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.500
Thief!

00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:47.750
Come out and catch the thieves!

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.500
-Thief!
-Take her away.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.666
Let me go!

00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:59.000
-Let me go!
-Go!

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:03.041
-Help! Hands off!
-Don't move, surrender now!

00:46:03.208 --> 00:46:04.250
Do you think I'm an idiot?

00:46:37.425 --> 00:46:38.508
Come on.

00:46:38.966 --> 00:46:40.175
Attack!

00:46:56.525 --> 00:46:59.066
Mo Chong-yuen,
how did these thieves get in?

00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:00.483
Madam.

00:47:00.608 --> 00:47:01.650
Speak.

00:47:03.358 --> 00:47:06.816
Madam, I saw 9527 with these people.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:11.108
Our residence will not be safe
if a thief is living in our residence.

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:14.275
-Take them to the police.
-All right.

00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:15.691
I am being framed, Madam.

00:47:15.858 --> 00:47:18.108
Madam, I have picked up
a book from the ground.

00:47:19.191 --> 00:47:20.358
<i>TONG YAN'S POETRY</i>

00:47:20.483 --> 00:47:21.775
Shit.

00:47:22.816 --> 00:47:24.566
Whose book is this?

00:47:25.483 --> 00:47:29.316
I've said it many times.
Tong Pak-fu's stuff is not allowed here.

00:47:29.691 --> 00:47:31.983
Whose book is it? Confess now.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.066
Chou-heung, do you know whose book it is?

00:47:34.525 --> 00:47:36.358
-Madam, I...
-Tell me now.

00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:38.525
Madam, I know.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.816
Tell me.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.775
It's mine.

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:44.400
If you want to punish someone,
please punish me.

00:47:44.775 --> 00:47:47.025
-Mo Chong-yuen.
-Yes, Madam.

00:47:47.775 --> 00:47:49.150
Whom should I punish?

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:52.233
Madam, please punish me.

00:47:52.525 --> 00:47:54.441
All right. Fine.

00:47:54.816 --> 00:47:56.941
Take him out and chop him into pieces.
Then feed our dogs.

00:47:57.566 --> 00:47:58.983
-Go.
-Don't!

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.483
In fact, I wanted to mislead the thieves
to save Chou-heung.

00:48:02.816 --> 00:48:03.733
Madam.

00:48:03.816 --> 00:48:05.775
I don't care what your relationship
with the thieves is.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.358
But you deserve to be killed
for having Tong Pak-fu's book.

00:48:08.983 --> 00:48:11.191
Madam, please listen to my explanation.

00:48:11.358 --> 00:48:12.608
What explanation?

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.900
<i>Madam, my hometown is Suzhou</i>

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:27.108
<i>I was wealthy</i>

00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:30.858
<i>But Tong Pak-fu was such a bastard</i>

00:48:31.025 --> 00:48:33.025
<i>He colluded with the government</i>

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.275
<i>He took away my wealth</i>

00:48:35.608 --> 00:48:37.400
<i>My grandfather argued with him</i>

00:48:37.483 --> 00:48:39.400
<i>But he was beaten to death</i>

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:41.275
<i>My grandmother scolded him</i>

00:48:41.358 --> 00:48:43.108
<i>But she was dragged to his residence</i>

00:48:43.233 --> 00:48:45.358
<i>How pitiful was she
She was assaulted over 100 times</i>

00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:47.441
<i>She hanged herself to death at last</i>

00:48:47.608 --> 00:48:51.275
<i>Tong Pak-fu kicked my father and me
Out of our house</i>

00:48:51.358 --> 00:48:54.400
<i>To feed my father, I became a beggar</i>

00:48:54.608 --> 00:48:56.775
<i>But Tong Pak-fu was too cruel</i>

00:48:56.941 --> 00:48:59.275
<i>He sent someone to attack us</i>

00:48:59.358 --> 00:49:01.150
<i>My father and I were beaten terribly</i>

00:49:01.316 --> 00:49:03.566
<i>I am stronger than my father</i>

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.233
<i>But my father was beaten to death</i>

00:49:05.316 --> 00:49:06.358
<i>I could never forget this</i>

00:49:06.441 --> 00:49:09.275
<i>To bury my father, I had to sell myself</i>

00:49:09.358 --> 00:49:11.358
<i>To save money and to study
At the same time</i>

00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:13.775
<i>In hopes to get a degree
And gain power in the government</i>

00:49:13.858 --> 00:49:15.566
<i>So that I can take revenge</i>

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.775
<i>That's why I take his poetry with me
To remember him always</i>

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.900
<i>It's too exciting!</i>

00:49:59.025 --> 00:50:00.650
<i>I want to praise him.</i>

00:50:01.483 --> 00:50:03.525
<i>No, I can't show this.</i>

00:50:03.775 --> 00:50:07.025
<i>But this feeling is amazing.</i>

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.066
<i>Such a touching story!</i>

00:50:09.191 --> 00:50:11.983
<i>He told his story in the form of rap!</i>

00:50:12.233 --> 00:50:15.150
<i>It's really interesting and touching!</i>

00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:19.233
<i>I am very amazed.</i>

00:50:19.441 --> 00:50:22.275
<i>Right, and his creativity...</i>

00:50:22.358 --> 00:50:24.941
<i>It's rich and powerful!</i>

00:50:25.108 --> 00:50:27.066
<i>He is so creative!</i>

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:29.233
<i>Yes, he is creative!</i>

00:50:29.441 --> 00:50:31.400
<i>I am now full of power!</i>

00:50:31.733 --> 00:50:34.275
<i>-Thank you, 9527.
-Thank you, 9527.</i>

00:50:34.441 --> 00:50:35.733
It's not touching enough yet.

00:50:36.108 --> 00:50:37.525
Watch me.

00:50:37.608 --> 00:50:40.275
What do we have to poop after eating?

00:50:40.358 --> 00:50:42.108
After pooping, we have to clean it.

00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:45.025
Damn!

00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:59.483
So Tong Pak-fu is your enemy.

00:50:59.816 --> 00:51:00.900
Yes, Madam.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.941
Madam, look at this man.

00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:05.983
I don't think he is useless.

00:51:06.233 --> 00:51:09.483
He seems to be educated.

00:51:10.316 --> 00:51:12.608
Now, there is a vacancy in the study room.

00:51:19.733 --> 00:51:21.566
Why don't you ask him

00:51:21.733 --> 00:51:23.900
to help the young masters
with their studies?

00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:28.233
Since Chou-heung asked for mercy,
I won't kill you.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.566
From now on,

00:51:31.066 --> 00:51:34.066
I will name you Wah Shington!

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.941
I don't think that name suits me.

00:51:37.275 --> 00:51:39.358
Then, I'll call you Wah On.

00:51:39.525 --> 00:51:40.691
Thank you.

00:51:41.191 --> 00:51:42.066
WAH'S RESIDENCE

00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:44.566
I want Chou-heung to get the ink for me.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.858
Do you want to fight with me
for Chou-heung?

00:51:46.941 --> 00:51:49.316
-I am older than you. She is mine.
-That's nonsense.

00:51:49.483 --> 00:51:51.358
-Do you want to compete with me?
-Go ahead!

00:51:51.941 --> 00:51:52.858
Damn you!

00:51:52.941 --> 00:51:55.066
How dare you! Go to hell.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.358
How dare you!
I want to teach you a lesson!

00:52:00.191 --> 00:52:02.233
For Chou-heung, I won't give a damn!

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.816
<i>I am finally the servant</i>

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.400
<i>This is within my expectation</i>

00:52:10.566 --> 00:52:13.275
<i>I am closer to Chou-heung now</i>

00:52:13.358 --> 00:52:17.566
<i>I am in a good mood, very good mood</i>

00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:19.775
Where are the young masters?

00:52:24.925 --> 00:52:26.175
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

00:52:26.383 --> 00:52:28.466
I am a servant who will help
with your studies.

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:31.841
You are the jerk
who disturbed my sleep last night.

00:52:31.925 --> 00:52:35.675
Right. You look great!

00:52:35.883 --> 00:52:37.883
I am pleased to serve you.

00:52:38.425 --> 00:52:39.758
I love this guy.

00:52:39.841 --> 00:52:42.383
-I'll treat you like a human being then.
-Get me tea.

00:52:42.466 --> 00:52:44.466
Sorry, there are three things I don't do.

00:52:44.633 --> 00:52:45.758
What are they?

00:52:45.841 --> 00:52:48.425
I won't serve others tea.
I won't wash clothes or clean the floor.

00:52:48.508 --> 00:52:49.925
I won't make my bed.

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:51.300
Just like us.

00:52:51.383 --> 00:52:54.091
-What do you know then?
-I know...

00:52:54.758 --> 00:52:57.800
how to play all kinds of music!

00:52:57.883 --> 00:52:59.966
I know fortune-telling.

00:53:00.216 --> 00:53:03.633
I know how to court women too.

00:53:04.008 --> 00:53:06.133
-Really?
-Show us something now.

00:53:06.383 --> 00:53:08.216
I don't think it's fine
to show my skills here.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.758
I think you are bluffing!

00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:11.383
Read our fortunes then.

00:53:11.466 --> 00:53:13.091
I don't think you're capable.

00:53:13.883 --> 00:53:17.050
If I am not wrong,
then you must be mentally retarded.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.550
-You are so good!
-I admire you so much!

00:53:20.633 --> 00:53:23.091
-May I call you Brother?
-May I call you Brother?

00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:24.466
I don't mind.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.508
From now on, bring me tea,
wash my clothes and make my bed.

00:53:30.675 --> 00:53:31.758
Wah Man, Wah Mo.

00:53:31.883 --> 00:53:34.508
Why are you kneeling on the floor?

00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:36.841
-We're calling him our brother.
-We're calling him our brother.

00:53:37.841 --> 00:53:41.300
How can you be their brother?

00:53:41.383 --> 00:53:44.675
It's just a joke, please forgive me.

00:53:44.883 --> 00:53:47.383
-No, Wah On. We will follow you.
-No, Wah On. We will follow you.

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.050
Young man.

00:53:49.133 --> 00:53:51.716
How dare you recruit my students?
Who are you?

00:53:52.008 --> 00:53:53.841
-May I know your name?
-May I know your name first?

00:53:53.925 --> 00:53:54.966
No, may I know your name?

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.341
-No, may I know your name first?
-I have to know your name first.

00:53:57.425 --> 00:53:59.591
-I'll tell you mine later.
-I won't, unless you tell me yours.

00:53:59.675 --> 00:54:00.550
No way.

00:54:00.675 --> 00:54:02.300
I come from Sishui.

00:54:02.425 --> 00:54:05.466
I am the teacher of the Wah family.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.925
Who are you?

00:54:07.008 --> 00:54:08.133
I come from Suzhou.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.216
I am a mere servant in the Wah family.

00:54:10.383 --> 00:54:12.466
That's all about me.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.175
How dare you!

00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:23.591
Do you know how powerful I am?

00:54:23.716 --> 00:54:25.966
I will kill everything that's in my way!

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.091
Wah Man, Wah Mo.

00:54:30.508 --> 00:54:32.091
Sir, what are you doing?

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:39.875
What's wrong with him?

00:54:40.041 --> 00:54:42.666
Father, you accidentally killed
the teacher.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.541
Congratulations, you killed him!

00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:46.541
No.

00:54:46.666 --> 00:54:49.000
I saw him performing some sort
of incantation to summon the gods.

00:54:49.083 --> 00:54:50.208
He thought he was invincible.

00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.375
But he failed,
so he stabbed himself to death.

00:54:52.708 --> 00:54:54.291
Right?

00:54:54.375 --> 00:54:56.166
Yes, that's right.

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.541
-Right.
-Right. Hey!

00:54:57.625 --> 00:54:59.666
-Take the corpse out.
-Yes.

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:00.708
Who are you?

00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:03.000
-He's Wah On. He helps us study.
-Yes, Father.

00:55:03.458 --> 00:55:05.833
Wah On, you helped me a lot.

00:55:05.916 --> 00:55:06.791
It's nothing!

00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:09.208
I want to promote you
to Senior Studying Companion.

00:55:09.291 --> 00:55:11.833
You're responsible for educating them,
do you understand?

00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:13.083
Thank you, sir.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.125
SENIOR STUDENT COMPANION

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:18.091
Wah On, go ahead.

00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:19.633
Come on!

00:56:19.716 --> 00:56:21.758
Wah On, come on.
Just like what you did that night.

00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:23.508
-Fine, listen to me.
-Fine.

00:56:23.591 --> 00:56:25.716
Wah On has two eyes.

00:56:26.008 --> 00:56:30.008
Three ladies have six breasts.

00:56:33.308 --> 00:56:35.558
-What's wrong?
-Wah On is telling dirty jokes.

00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:36.766
Right.

00:56:37.725 --> 00:56:39.016
-Ms. Chou-heung.
-Wah On.

00:56:39.175 --> 00:56:40.633
Were you joking around with others?

00:56:40.758 --> 00:56:42.550
No, I was reciting a poem.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.633
-What kind of poem?
-Tong Pak-fu's poem?

00:56:45.216 --> 00:56:46.300
Of course not.

00:56:46.383 --> 00:56:48.841
-Tong Pak-fu is my enemy.
-You can't fool me!

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:50.758
But you are good

00:56:51.133 --> 00:56:54.300
at making such an interesting story
in a limited time.

00:56:55.508 --> 00:56:58.550
Ms. Chou-heung, you are really wise.

00:56:58.758 --> 00:57:02.841
But why did you impersonate
Tong Pak-fu that night?

00:57:05.008 --> 00:57:06.091
Guess.

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:11.050
I know, you must know Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:11.133 --> 00:57:12.050
Of course.

00:57:12.258 --> 00:57:13.675
Can you introduce him to me?

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.883
I am Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:15.008 --> 00:57:18.591
Don't joke around. I mean it.

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.633
Everybody knows Tong Pak-fu.
He was born wild.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.383
But he doesn't know me.

00:57:24.675 --> 00:57:26.216
I think you have misunderstood
Tong Pak-fu.

00:57:26.633 --> 00:57:28.800
Being wild is just on the surface.

00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:31.966
But from his poems,

00:57:32.216 --> 00:57:34.716
I can tell that he is a passionate

00:57:35.008 --> 00:57:36.466
and righteous man.

00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:40.091
Hey.

00:57:40.633 --> 00:57:41.925
What are you doing?

00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:43.883
I feel so touched that I want to cry.

00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:46.758
You are a great observer.

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.300
If Tong Pak-fu had a friend like you,

00:57:49.591 --> 00:57:51.341
he wouldn't have any regrets.

00:57:51.758 --> 00:57:53.008
You are lying.

00:57:54.383 --> 00:57:55.675
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:57:56.425 --> 00:57:58.925
What do you think about me?

00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:00.758
I think

00:58:01.216 --> 00:58:02.633
you are a fool.

00:58:03.716 --> 00:58:05.383
Ms. Chou-heung.

00:58:08.258 --> 00:58:10.258
Are you willing to study poems and songs

00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:13.050
with this fool at midnight

00:58:13.466 --> 00:58:15.925
in front of the willow tree?

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:28.466
Fine.

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:29.591
Thank you.

00:58:29.675 --> 00:58:30.800
Don't mention it.

00:58:30.883 --> 00:58:32.758
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

00:58:33.008 --> 00:58:35.883
Chou-heung, Tong Pak-fu is caught
by our security, Mo Chong-yuen.

00:58:38.716 --> 00:58:40.216
Help!

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:42.091
-Shut up.
-Why?

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.091
I met this guy at the market.
He claimed to be Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:45.258 --> 00:58:47.175
He was selling Tong Pak-fu's paintings.

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.966
So, I brought him here to you, Madam.

00:58:53.175 --> 00:58:54.758
It's the painting of Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:54.925 --> 00:58:56.841
I was framed. I am not Tong Pak-fu.

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:59.466
If you are not him,
why do you have so many paintings of his?

00:59:00.383 --> 00:59:03.425
I stole them
when Tong Pak-fu wasn't at home.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:05.341
You say you are not Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:05.425 --> 00:59:06.425
Who are you then?

00:59:06.508 --> 00:59:09.133
I am Chuck Chi-shan, I swear!

00:59:09.216 --> 00:59:10.300
You still won't admit it?

00:59:10.425 --> 00:59:12.383
Fine, Tung-heung.

00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:14.133
Ask Wah On to come here.

00:59:14.341 --> 00:59:17.633
I want him to identify his enemy,
Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:17.716 --> 00:59:18.758
Yes, Madam.

00:59:18.841 --> 00:59:20.300
Wah On?

00:59:25.466 --> 00:59:26.591
Madam.

00:59:26.716 --> 00:59:27.633
What's the matter?

00:59:27.716 --> 00:59:30.425
I talked too much yesterday
that my muscle hurts.

00:59:30.716 --> 00:59:33.425
Identify this guy.
Tell me if he is Tong Pak-fu.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:34.716
All right.

00:59:38.716 --> 00:59:40.341
It's you.

00:59:40.508 --> 00:59:42.216
How can you recognize me?

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.966
-I definitely know you. You are Tong--
-Right.

00:59:45.175 --> 00:59:48.300
I am the one Tong Pak-fu wanted to kill!

00:59:48.508 --> 00:59:50.300
If you don't want to die,
you'd better shut up.

00:59:50.383 --> 00:59:53.758
Madam, Tong Pak-fu is always masked
when he does bad things.

00:59:53.841 --> 00:59:55.841
I am not very sure.

00:59:56.341 --> 00:59:58.341
Well, don't miss out on this chance.

00:59:58.466 --> 01:00:00.050
-Kill him.
-Hold it.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.925
He must be somebody to Tong Pak-fu.

01:00:04.008 --> 01:00:06.425
So why not let him live?
Maybe we can get Tong Pak-fu by using him.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.216
Well, I can let him live,
but with severe punishment.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.883
Shek-lau, lock him up in the storeroom.

01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:14.466
Torture him as you like.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.925
Thank you, Madam.

01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:19.091
-What do you want?
-Bring him in.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.175
Don't touch me. I am still a virgin.

01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:27.925
How enjoyable!

01:00:37.716 --> 01:00:39.425
Do you want to kill me
to keep your secret?

01:00:39.508 --> 01:00:41.633
Shut up. You'd better run for your life.

01:00:41.716 --> 01:00:42.925
No, I don't want to leave.

01:00:43.175 --> 01:00:46.175
I have good food here

01:00:46.258 --> 01:00:48.466
and I get to sleep with a wonderful woman.

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:49.716
Are you kidding?

01:00:49.841 --> 01:00:51.966
I mean it. I owe the loan sharks
too much money.

01:00:52.133 --> 01:00:54.175
-This is the best place for me to hide.
-You...

01:00:54.466 --> 01:00:55.591
Someone is coming.

01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:05.383
Are you all right?

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.966
What's the matter, Ms. Chou-heung?

01:01:08.175 --> 01:01:10.466
Are you Tong Pak-fu?

01:01:11.175 --> 01:01:12.883
Why do you ask me this question?

01:01:13.633 --> 01:01:17.341
Actually, I admire Tong Pak-fu very much.

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:19.175
I want to meet him.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.675
Please tell me the truth.

01:01:25.966 --> 01:01:28.341
Right, I am Tong Pak-fu.

01:01:30.175 --> 01:01:31.425
What noise is it?

01:01:31.716 --> 01:01:33.300
It's the noise of some animals.

01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:35.425
Shut up.

01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:39.133
Chou-heung.

01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:42.341
It's fated for us to meet.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.633
Let's have a long chat.

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:51.133
May I ask you a question?

01:01:51.966 --> 01:01:53.133
Sure.

01:01:54.216 --> 01:01:56.591
But to show that you are sincere enough,

01:01:57.216 --> 01:01:59.050
you have to answer a question first.

01:02:01.508 --> 01:02:03.925
Close your eyes.

01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:07.841
Relax.

01:02:10.008 --> 01:02:14.258
Put your head on my left shoulder.

01:02:16.425 --> 01:02:19.341
Don't be nervous. Don't you trust me?

01:02:22.175 --> 01:02:24.300
Relax.

01:02:25.216 --> 01:02:28.383
Let your face touch mine slowly.

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.925
Right, good girl.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.966
-I cannot stand this anymore.
-Hey, I am coming.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:36.341
Somebody is coming.

01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:51.258
Miss, who are you?

01:02:51.341 --> 01:02:54.758
Don't you remember me?
You just slept with me!

01:02:55.425 --> 01:02:58.466
I am a civilized man.
What are you talking about?

01:02:59.091 --> 01:03:01.300
You tried very hard just now.

01:03:01.716 --> 01:03:03.425
But there was no one else.

01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:06.591
What? I don't care.
I want to play a game with you now.

01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:08.883
The Beauty and the Beast!

01:03:10.175 --> 01:03:11.966
I know Tong Pak-fu now.

01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:14.675
Wah On is even better than him.

01:03:15.008 --> 01:03:16.591
Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:18.591
Why are you here?

01:03:19.258 --> 01:03:21.591
I came to watch something. How about you?

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:23.133
Me too.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.716
Let's watch together.

01:03:26.633 --> 01:03:27.925
This is great.

01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:29.300
Really?

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:35.758
Do you think I am nothing?

01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:41.300
-Once more.
-I'll give you more!

01:03:41.383 --> 01:03:44.716
-Move.
-Move.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.925
Your Excellency,
King Ning is coming with a troop.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.675
Dear, His Majesty always goes against you.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.425
In the government meeting,
you are his political enemy.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:20.300
He is bringing his troop here.

01:04:20.425 --> 01:04:21.966
I'm afraid he has some tricks
up his sleeve.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.091
We should be careful.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:25.966
Here comes King Ning.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.175
How are you?

01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:38.883
Thank you for visiting us.

01:04:39.466 --> 01:04:40.758
I heard

01:04:41.008 --> 01:04:43.633
you love Chinese paintings very much.

01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:48.258
I tried very hard to find
Tong Pak-fu's paintings for you.

01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:49.258
Your Majesty.

01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:52.258
Enough. Bring me the paintings.

01:04:52.341 --> 01:04:53.425
Yes.

01:04:55.133 --> 01:04:57.758
It's really vivid! What a nice painting!

01:04:57.841 --> 01:05:00.758
Right? It's so great!

01:05:01.216 --> 01:05:02.800
I have remounted it.

01:05:03.341 --> 01:05:06.050
Look at the king of the birds.

01:05:06.133 --> 01:05:07.716
It looks as if it is alive.

01:05:08.216 --> 01:05:10.800
It really is the king of the birds.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:15.716
How could I accept such a precious gift?

01:05:16.008 --> 01:05:17.675
If you don't, you're not giving me face.

01:05:17.758 --> 01:05:18.841
Do you want me to get mad?

01:05:19.258 --> 01:05:20.508
Don't get mad.

01:05:21.425 --> 01:05:25.300
I want to have a look at the painting too.

01:05:25.466 --> 01:05:28.258
All right. Since you love paintings too,

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.841
have a look.

01:05:35.091 --> 01:05:36.758
Chou-heung, come and have a look.

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.216
Yes, Madam.

01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:43.383
This is <i>Peacock</i> painted by Tong Yan.

01:05:43.508 --> 01:05:45.508
But a peacock
is an ordinary bird after all.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:49.341
Even though you have remounted it,
it won't help.

01:05:49.675 --> 01:05:51.133
After all, an ordinary bird

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.300
can't become a phoenix.

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:57.050
Your Majesty, please forgive her.

01:05:57.258 --> 01:05:59.216
She is still new
in studying about paintings.

01:05:59.341 --> 01:06:00.883
Please forgive her ignorance.

01:06:01.633 --> 01:06:03.800
Your Majesty, since they're experts
in Pak-fu's paintings,

01:06:03.883 --> 01:06:07.675
they must have kept
better paintings of Tong Yan here.

01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:09.633
You are right.

01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:12.466
Madam, why don't you show me
the paintings of Tong Yan?

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:15.008
Frankly, we don't have
any of Tong Pak-fu's paintings.

01:06:15.716 --> 01:06:18.175
Goodness, you are fooling His Majesty.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.758
-Your Excellency.
-Your Majesty.

01:06:20.175 --> 01:06:23.841
Tong Pak-fu is now
staying in our guest room.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.008
Chou-heung, please bring Tong Pak-fu here.

01:06:27.133 --> 01:06:28.216
Yes, Madam.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.133
Madam, here comes Tong Pak-fu.

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.466
Tong Pak-fu.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:40.216
I want you to draw a picture of a phoenix

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.800
for His Majesty.

01:06:42.633 --> 01:06:45.550
All right. I want to know

01:06:45.758 --> 01:06:47.133
how nice your phoenix is!

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.550
If you can't draw a nice phoenix,
you might be killed.

01:06:49.675 --> 01:06:51.591
Tong Pak-fu, draw it now.

01:07:02.008 --> 01:07:03.508
It's done.

01:07:08.341 --> 01:07:10.258
Look, this is <i>Holy Phoenix</i>.

01:07:12.258 --> 01:07:14.633
What? It's only a chick.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.133
Something is missing.

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.466
A halo, right here.

01:07:22.008 --> 01:07:23.050
Look, isn't it holy now?

01:07:23.133 --> 01:07:25.258
Gosh, how dare you fool me!

01:07:30.716 --> 01:07:33.591
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I've always known he wasn't Tong Pak-fu.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.675
Now, we've found out the truth
from his painting.

01:07:36.758 --> 01:07:38.341
-Take him out.
-Yes.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:43.716
I heard you are great at writing poems.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.675
My consultant wants to learn
something from you.

01:07:46.966 --> 01:07:49.300
No, the others will tease
Our Excellency of bullying your people.

01:07:49.383 --> 01:07:50.300
Right.

01:07:50.383 --> 01:07:52.383
There's no such thing
as ranking in literature.

01:07:52.466 --> 01:07:54.091
This is just for fun.

01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:57.800
If you don't accept this challenge,
I'll lose my temper.

01:07:58.550 --> 01:07:59.591
Begin!

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:03.383
A for apple and B for boy.
C for cat and D for dog.

01:08:03.466 --> 01:08:06.466
E for egg and G for girl.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.716
Come on, continue it.
Are you not giving me face?

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.550
I will lose my temper!
Don't make me angry.

01:08:10.633 --> 01:08:11.966
Please let me try.

01:08:12.758 --> 01:08:16.966
Doe, a deer, a female deer.
Ray, a drop of golden sun.

01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:19.883
Me, a name I call myself.
Far, a long, long way to run.

01:08:21.341 --> 01:08:22.966
Great distich!

01:08:24.008 --> 01:08:27.341
-Wah On, you came in time!
-It's all right. Don't worry.

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:32.300
I am the consultant of His Majesty,

01:08:32.425 --> 01:08:35.800
The Number One Distich Writer,
Tu Chuen-chang.

01:08:38.175 --> 01:08:39.633
I have studied for two years.

01:08:39.758 --> 01:08:43.258
I am a servant here. Call me Wah On.

01:08:43.383 --> 01:08:46.383
Okay. Let me play with you.

01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:20.300
Sorry, we can't control ourselves.

01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.341
Let's start now.

01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:30.133
In pictures,

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:32.383
the dragons and tigers won't roar.

01:09:32.633 --> 01:09:34.966
In chess,

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:37.341
the horses and the generals can't fight.

01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:39.716
Bravo.

01:09:40.383 --> 01:09:43.716
An A, a B, a C, and a D.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.466
An E, an F, a G, and an H.

01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:52.883
Wah On! You are a good distich writer!

01:09:53.008 --> 01:09:54.591
Raise another distich.

01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:57.591
See, a jerk standing over there.

01:09:57.758 --> 01:10:01.633
Here, a bastard is sitting before me.

01:10:05.675 --> 01:10:08.300
I am a hero on the battlefield.

01:10:08.425 --> 01:10:11.341
You are a chicken in bed instead.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.925
I can't be embarrassed
in front of a small potato!

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.508
Let's plant the trees together.

01:10:18.758 --> 01:10:20.925
For the grave of your father.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.966
My grandmother has prepared supper.

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:25.216
My godfather has slept
with your grandmother.

01:10:27.175 --> 01:10:28.425
Bravo!

01:10:30.675 --> 01:10:32.341
Writing distich is for fun only.

01:10:32.425 --> 01:10:35.008
But why are you hurt
while playing this game?

01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:37.675
I wonder how powerful the words are.

01:10:39.383 --> 01:10:41.216
Wah On, it's fine here.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.008
-Go back and clean the floor.
-Yes, Your Excellency.

01:10:44.133 --> 01:10:48.091
Your Majesty, forgive my little servant.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.591
He stopped you from losing your temper.

01:10:52.675 --> 01:10:55.216
Fine. Evil Scholar.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.133
Bring the painting granted by the emperor
to show to Mr. Wah.

01:10:58.216 --> 01:11:00.133
-Yes.
-Let's look at it together.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:02.550
Please catch the painting.

01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:04.633
Watch out.

01:11:06.216 --> 01:11:08.800
It's not convenient to look at it here.
Let's go over there.

01:11:28.591 --> 01:11:30.800
It's a precious painting.
You'd better keep it carefully.

01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:34.508
We have plenty of time!

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:52.008
Is Madam in danger?

01:11:52.091 --> 01:11:53.341
Let's go and take a look.

01:11:53.466 --> 01:11:54.591
All right, let's go.

01:11:55.133 --> 01:11:56.675
Madam, how are you?

01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:00.591
What's the matter?

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:01.591
I won't tell you.

01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:02.675
Ms. Chou-heung.

01:12:04.841 --> 01:12:07.966
-I was punched three times.
-How ugly!

01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:10.508
I was beaten eight times.

01:12:12.216 --> 01:12:13.966
Someone is uglier than me at last!

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:15.675
Ms. Chou-heung, what happened?

01:12:17.591 --> 01:12:19.341
I was beaten over 30 times.

01:12:19.633 --> 01:12:21.008
Ghost!

01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:24.216
Ghost!

01:12:28.258 --> 01:12:29.675
She's Chou-heung!

01:12:29.841 --> 01:12:31.591
Yes, she was seriously beaten.

01:12:31.716 --> 01:12:34.758
Did she get hurt by the most horrible...

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:38.125
Yes, she got hurt from the Faceless Kick.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:41.208
Damn! She was kicked by me.
I thought it was a ghost.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:42.833
Ms. Chou-heung.

01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.458
-What have I done?
-You got hurt

01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:04.625
by the most horrible Faceless Kick
and you were in danger.

01:13:04.708 --> 01:13:08.208
Luckily, I saved you with my Beauty Fist
and returned you to normal.

01:13:08.291 --> 01:13:10.333
You are fine now.

01:13:10.916 --> 01:13:13.291
-Thank you, Wah On.
-Don't mention it.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.291
-Wah On, is my face okay now?
-Your chin is still a little ugly.

01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:17.583
Use more force.

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.533
Chou-heung, your pretty face is back!

01:13:32.801 --> 01:13:34.183
Madam!

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.166
Mr. Wah, I was so kind
to show you the painting.

01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:07.250
Why did you tear it?

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:09.916
Please don't be mad. I didn't mean to.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.083
Cut the crap.
You've ruined the royal treasure.

01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:13.458
I will report to His Majesty.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.708
He will execute your whole family!

01:14:16.208 --> 01:14:17.416
Wait!

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:20.250
About the <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
you've just presented,

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:22.708
I don't think it's the real one.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.000
How dare you fool me?

01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:27.958
It was given by the emperor.
How can it be fake?

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.625
I am going to lose my temper.

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:32.708
Hold it. In fact, the real
<i>Spring and Autumn</i> is being kept here.

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:34.791
It has always been kept in our house.

01:14:35.416 --> 01:14:38.041
If you don't believe me, let me show you.
Chou-heung, follow me.

01:14:40.333 --> 01:14:41.416
Your Majesty.

01:14:41.625 --> 01:14:43.666
Fine, I want to know
what you are going to show me.

01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:46.416
You'll be in deep trouble later.

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:49.708
Wah On, what are you doing?

01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:52.208
How can we have the <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
drawn by Tong Pak-fu?

01:14:52.291 --> 01:14:53.666
What should we do now?

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:55.208
Chou-heung, please bring me the ink.

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:57.833
No, we have no choice. Get me the ink.

01:14:57.916 --> 01:15:00.750
-What?
-Get me some ink.

01:15:01.958 --> 01:15:03.541
I have to draw it by memory.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.208
But it's hard to imitate
the painting of Tong Pak-fu!

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:11.083
I hope King Ning will be fooled.

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:12.666
Impossible!

01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:16.166
How will he get tricked by my painting?

01:15:16.666 --> 01:15:19.291
Wah On, you've messed up!

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:23.000
You will be killed
and so will the Wah family!

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:24.916
You'd better leave.

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:28.458
Nobody is outside, go now.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.083
-Did you paint it?
-Yes.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.000
I earned my living
by imitating Tong Yan's paintings.

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:44.750
I've imitated <i>Spring and Autumn</i>
a hundred times.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:46.041
Hopefully, it can save us.

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:48.458
This is for me to survive,
so I have to carry it.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:50.833
-How can you draw so fast?
-I was slow this time.

01:15:56.675 --> 01:15:58.925
This is the painting by Tong Pak-fu.

01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:02.050
How can you claim this is true?
What proof do you have?

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.400
Why don't you ask the expert to check it?

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.358
Tu Chuen-chang.

01:16:10.975 --> 01:16:13.475
Are you still alive? If you are,
come and check out this painting.

01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:17.850
-Is this going to work?
-We'll have to take our chances.

01:16:20.225 --> 01:16:22.683
This is really drawn by Tong Yan.

01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:26.641
Are you kidding me? Impossible.

01:16:26.766 --> 01:16:28.141
Look carefully!

01:16:28.266 --> 01:16:32.016
It's true, but it's rather wet.

01:16:34.908 --> 01:16:36.908
The weather is misty, so it's wet.

01:16:36.991 --> 01:16:38.283
Yes, it's misty.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.950
You may die now.

01:16:40.033 --> 01:16:41.491
Your Majesty, you are too careless.

01:16:41.658 --> 01:16:43.533
How could your painting get stolen?

01:16:43.658 --> 01:16:45.991
Maybe the emperor will execute you
after he finds out about this.

01:16:46.658 --> 01:16:49.325
But we are friends.

01:16:49.469 --> 01:16:50.916
Take this as my regard.

01:16:51.166 --> 01:16:53.333
Keep it safe!

01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:55.708
Otherwise, it may be stolen again.

01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:59.108
Your Majesty, we should leave.
He is difficult to handle.

01:17:00.608 --> 01:17:02.108
Fine, let's go.

01:17:03.391 --> 01:17:04.808
Hold it.

01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:07.266
You said you wanted to lose your temper.

01:17:07.516 --> 01:17:08.850
Remember?

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.749
Good. I'll show you.

01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:18.508
Are you scared?

01:17:23.591 --> 01:17:25.425
Why didn't you kill them?

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:27.750
That servant is not that simple.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:29.166
I was almost trapped.

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:30.458
What do you mean?

01:17:30.541 --> 01:17:34.250
Your kung fu is the most powerful
in the world, isn't it?

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:37.500
Why are you scared of a little servant?

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:40.291
Your Majesty, my sword is powerful.

01:17:40.375 --> 01:17:42.041
I was afraid it would hurt you.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.583
You humiliated me.

01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:46.833
Your Majesty, I swear.

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:48.916
In three days, after I recover,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.333
I will take revenge for you
and kill Mr. Wah.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.583
And his wife, Madam Wah.

01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:56.541
And the servant.

01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:58.416
And Chou-heung.

01:17:58.916 --> 01:18:02.000
Anyway, kill them all!

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:03.250
Yes, sir!

01:18:04.425 --> 01:18:06.300
-Brother, are you comfortable?
-Quite comfortable.

01:18:06.383 --> 01:18:09.800
Brother, you have a move
called Beauty Fist.

01:18:09.883 --> 01:18:13.050
Can you use that move to make us handsome?

01:18:13.133 --> 01:18:14.258
Yes, please beat us.

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:17.008
But you are too handsome!

01:18:17.383 --> 01:18:19.300
But I don't mind being more handsome.

01:18:19.383 --> 01:18:21.758
-Right. Please give me some tea.
-Brother...

01:18:22.533 --> 01:18:25.533
Really? How can you talk like this?
It's our duty to serve you!

01:18:25.616 --> 01:18:27.116
How can you mention the word "please?"

01:18:27.283 --> 01:18:29.533
Don't you take us as your fellows?

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.116
The word "please" will disappoint us,

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.200
causing hormonal imbalance
and fecal incontinence.

01:18:33.283 --> 01:18:35.825
It will drive us crazy
and I might poop on your body.

01:18:36.133 --> 01:18:39.008
It's only a "please."
Don't you think you're a little dramatic?

01:18:39.238 --> 01:18:41.925
-Stop laughing. I'm serious.
-We're serious.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:45.050
Understood. You jerks, bring me some tea.

01:18:45.258 --> 01:18:47.675
-Right.
-Right. I love that, Brother!

01:18:47.758 --> 01:18:49.091
Thank you, Brother.

01:18:52.908 --> 01:18:54.033
-Mother.
-What?

01:18:54.241 --> 01:18:55.200
Where are you going?

01:18:55.283 --> 01:18:56.200
To get some tea.

01:18:56.283 --> 01:18:58.658
Get out. I have something
to say to Wah On.

01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:00.283
Okay.

01:19:00.825 --> 01:19:02.783
-Please be seated.
-After you, Madam.

01:19:03.366 --> 01:19:05.283
Wah On, you've done a lot for us.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.158
Here is a cup of ginseng tea.

01:19:07.408 --> 01:19:08.908
Drink it. It's nutritious.

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:11.408
-Wah On.
-Thank you, Ms. Chou-heung.

01:19:11.741 --> 01:19:13.408
You're welcome. Drink it while it's hot.

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:16.408
You are educated.

01:19:16.533 --> 01:19:18.491
I think you should be recruited
by the government.

01:19:18.616 --> 01:19:21.158
Why are you serving in our residence?

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:24.950
Madam, I don't care about
serving in the government.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.741
Moreover, you and Ms. Chou-heung
treat me so nicely

01:19:27.908 --> 01:19:30.908
that I wish I can stay
in the residence forever.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.158
What a wonderful scholar you are,

01:19:34.366 --> 01:19:36.450
Tong Pak-fu!

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.125
Are you talking to me?

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:44.291
Stop pretending.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:48.083
From your kung fu and poetry,
I have guessed something.

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:51.375
Although I hate your family very much,
you saved me yesterday.

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:54.916
I am very reasonable. I won't harm you.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.250
Just confess!

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.583
I am not, but even if I say yes,

01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:01.583
I won't be able to do anything
if you really want to harm me.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:04.083
-Do you understand what I'm talking about?
-Yes, I do,

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.208
but you still have to confess one day.

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:07.500
Make it tomorrow.

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:09.333
You are so cocky!

01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:10.416
So what?

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:11.791
Fine.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.833
I will marry Chou-heung off to you
if you confess.

01:20:14.916 --> 01:20:16.375
-Madam.
-Really?

01:20:16.666 --> 01:20:18.458
You must keep your promise.

01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:19.375
That's right.

01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:24.041
I am the wise and handsome hero,
Tong Pak-fu.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.916
Madam.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.125
You are nosy.

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:35.458
-Madam, you...
-I didn't keep my promise, so what?

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.625
I want you to die now!

01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:43.041
Hey, please stay calm. No weapons, please.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:44.916
Are you begging me?

01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:48.916
Tong Tin-ho, you heartless guy.

01:20:49.041 --> 01:20:50.375
I couldn't kill you,

01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:53.500
but I can kill your son
to avenge my broken heart.

01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:55.708
Don't blame me for being frank.

01:20:55.958 --> 01:20:59.333
How can you kill me with these guys?

01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:01.458
Are you kidding me?

01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:04.125
Let me tell you.

01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:07.583
The ginseng tea you just drank is poisoned

01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:13.041
by something called
the Greatest Drug in the World.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.500
How can you claim it to be
the greatest drug in the world?

01:21:19.791 --> 01:21:23.125
How about my Tong's Killing Pill?

01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:25.416
Bullshit.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.416
The Greatest Drug in the World
is made of seven venomous insects

01:21:28.541 --> 01:21:31.416
and arsenic trioxide,
under 49 days processing.

01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:34.750
It's tasteless and colorless.
No one can stay alive after taking it.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.375
My Tong's Killing Pill is made of honey,

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:39.166
fritillaria cirrhosa, and balloon flower,

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:41.208
plus snow lotus from Tin Shan.

01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:44.125
No freezing
or preservative ingredients added.

01:21:44.416 --> 01:21:45.958
It's a powerful poison.

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:48.416
And it tastes good too.

01:21:49.166 --> 01:21:53.583
You will lose your kung fu
after taking my drugs,

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:57.833
and your blood will flow
in the opposite direction until death.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:01.000
At last, you will explode and die.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:04.541
Right, after eating
my Tong's Killing Pill,

01:22:04.833 --> 01:22:08.416
you won't be able to move
even one step or smile.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:11.708
Otherwise, your whole body will explode.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.083
It's so convenient.

01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:15.625
To kill a person.

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:18.041
-And it's easy to carry too.
-And it's easy to carry too.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:20.666
Where is it being sold?

01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:24.416
You are lucky. I have one here.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.541
I don't think it's powerful.

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:29.708
No, my pill is the most powerful drug!

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:32.000
What a joke! You are bluffing!

01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:33.666
You don't believe me?
Do you dare to take one?

01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:36.291
-Do you think I'm afraid?
-I don't think you dare to take it.

01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:37.916
-Okay, I will take it.
-Go ahead.

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.750
-All right.
-Eat this.

01:22:39.833 --> 01:22:41.416
How dare you challenge me?

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:43.500
-Go ahead if you have guts.
-I have guts, of course.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.750
Watch me.

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:51.833
Do you think I am an idiot? Eat this?

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:54.208
Eat this.

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:58.333
You are not stupid. You are very stupid.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:03.000
Now that we are all poisoned,
why don't we exchange antidotes?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.958
Damn you, are you threatening me?

01:23:05.208 --> 01:23:07.750
Madam, it's not worth to take the risk.
Your life is precious.

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:10.458
Hey, lock him up in the storeroom.
Let him die there.

01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:11.583
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:17.333
-Madam, please be merciful.
-Enough.

01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:21.208
Bullshit. I don't think
his poison can kill me.

01:23:21.416 --> 01:23:23.541
If worse comes to worse,
I won't smile or walk.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:39.875
Chou-heung.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.041
Shut up.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.583
I have stolen many antidotes
from Madam's exercise room.

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:49.250
See which one of these can save you.

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:51.541
I appreciate that
you took the risk to save Wah On.

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:54.208
Wah On?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.750
In fact, when you drew that painting,

01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:00.000
I've long known your identity.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.500
I didn't expect that
you would confess your identity.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:08.000
Chou-heung,
I have done all that just for...

01:24:08.208 --> 01:24:11.625
I want to ask you a question.
Please answer me.

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:12.833
What is it?

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:15.291
Is Tong Pak-fu your nickname?

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:18.250
No. Why do you ask?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.666
Pak-fu, Pak-fool...

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:25.666
It's really funny!

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:31.916
If you don't want to answer me,
just forget it.

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:33.000
Thank you.

01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:34.500
What color do you like?

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:37.750
Many colors. Let's say, yellow.

01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:40.375
Yellow? This color?

01:24:40.689 --> 01:24:41.625
Yes.

01:24:42.291 --> 01:24:44.375
That's why you always follow me.

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:48.041
Other than drawing,
what hobbies do you have?

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:50.041
Nothing special.

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:53.250
Just listening to music
or playing the flute.

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:56.958
-You know how to play the flute! Great!
-Yes.

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.416
-Let me teach you sometime.
-Okay.

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:03.291
You are the leading scholar
of the Four Scholars.

01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.416
Have you felt any pressure?

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.708
That's a good question.

01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:11.041
It's a huge pressure.

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:14.500
So I always have a trip
to reduce my pressure.

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:15.625
I understand.

01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:18.458
Did you invent the Tong's Killing Pill?

01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:22.291
-Of course not. I fooled Madam Wah.
-You are cunning!

01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:24.708
Do you think she has found the antidote?

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.000
It's not here.

01:25:26.208 --> 01:25:28.041
So unlucky!

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.958
I want to ask you,
are you scared of ghosts?

01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:36.000
Tong Pak-fu is despicable.
He made me jump for a few days.

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:38.875
Madam, since you're not poisoned,

01:25:39.125 --> 01:25:41.291
why don't you set him free?

01:25:41.416 --> 01:25:44.458
Chou-heung, if you weren't
my favorite maid,

01:25:44.958 --> 01:25:47.500
I would have kicked you out of my home.

01:25:48.083 --> 01:25:49.875
Don't mention Tong Pak-fu again.

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.916
-Madam.
-Get out of here.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I have served you for years.

01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:58.833
You've treated me nicely.

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.083
I can't repay that with my life.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.458
Please forgive me

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:07.333
because I'm going to beg you
to let Tong Pak-fu go.

01:26:08.416 --> 01:26:12.083
I wish to be punished
on behalf of Tong Pak-fu.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.333
Chou-heung, how dare you!

01:26:18.958 --> 01:26:20.375
-Chou-heung.
-Chou-heung.

01:26:21.333 --> 01:26:23.333
If you don't promise me, I won't get up.

01:26:23.583 --> 01:26:24.666
-Madam!
-Madam!

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:27.750
I won't change my mind.

01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:29.541
Madam!

01:26:29.625 --> 01:26:31.625
What are you doing?

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:34.875
We are like sisters.

01:26:35.166 --> 01:26:37.958
Please let Tong Pak-fu go
for the sake of Chou-heung.

01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:39.750
-Tung-heung.
-Please, we beg you.

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:40.958
What do you mean?

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:42.166
Drag them out.

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:43.500
-Madam.
-Madam.

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.416
Mo Chong-yuen, where have you gone?

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:03.125
How dare you mess things up here!

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:05.416
Mr. Wah has offended His Majesty.

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:06.916
You were lucky last time.

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:09.333
But I won't let you go now.
I want to kill your whole family.

01:27:09.416 --> 01:27:11.083
You are not qualified
to mess things up here.

01:27:23.625 --> 01:27:25.875
-Tung-heung, inform Mr. Wah now.
-Yes.

01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:30.916
Go.

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:33.583
What's the matter?

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.041
Follow me.

01:27:37.075 --> 01:27:38.325
What happened?

01:27:38.408 --> 01:27:40.783
-The Evil Scholar is here to kill.
-Evil Scholar?

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:43.325
-You should go, it's dangerous out there.
-What about you?

01:27:43.408 --> 01:27:45.825
-Forget about me, go!
-Hey.

01:27:46.408 --> 01:27:47.783
Chou-heung.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.616
Madam means the world to me.
I'll stay with her no matter what happens.

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.908
Open the door first.

01:27:52.991 --> 01:27:54.325
-Wah On.
-What?

01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:56.033
I love you.

01:27:56.116 --> 01:27:59.033
What did you say? Chou-heung!

01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:02.725
Go and help!

01:28:04.483 --> 01:28:05.816
Where are you going?

01:28:07.525 --> 01:28:09.441
Chou-heung, ask Wah On to help us.

01:28:09.525 --> 01:28:11.400
Only Wah On can help us.

01:28:11.566 --> 01:28:12.941
Wah On has left.

01:28:13.150 --> 01:28:15.483
He is so disloyal!

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.483
Father, Mother has left.
Let's run for our lives.

01:28:19.566 --> 01:28:20.483
Sure.

01:28:22.358 --> 01:28:23.191
Madam.

01:28:23.275 --> 01:28:24.316
Madam.

01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:30.650
Madam.

01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:33.608
-Madam.
-How are you?

01:28:52.108 --> 01:28:53.233
Madam.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.691
-Wah On?
-He is Tong Pak-fu.

01:29:17.775 --> 01:29:19.650
Be careful! You're still poisoned.

01:29:19.858 --> 01:29:22.296
Don't worry, I got the antidote
from your exercise room.

01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:25.650
I took some time to take a bath
and get changed.

01:29:26.316 --> 01:29:29.275
Evil Scholar,
you tricked my father in the duel.

01:29:29.775 --> 01:29:31.733
Let's see if you can defeat me too.

01:29:33.441 --> 01:29:35.108
So you are the son of that poor fellow.

01:29:35.483 --> 01:29:37.483
That's why you look familiar!

01:29:37.608 --> 01:29:39.358
I have to avenge my father now.

01:29:39.566 --> 01:29:42.525
Tong's Spear should be number one
on the weapon list.

01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.875
Watch me.

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:01.333
Your father was stupid, and so are you!

01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:03.208
Why did you stab me without its head?

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.458
But it's still powerful!

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:13.750
I've made it powerful
even though there is no head.

01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:14.916
Now, die.

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:21.375
From now on, our Tong's Spear

01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:23.166
is the champion on the weapon list.

01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:25.083
Wah On, are you all right?

01:31:25.166 --> 01:31:26.541
I am fine, how about you?

01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:30.500
Great. I am so glad you came in time.

01:31:31.208 --> 01:31:34.458
Tong Pak-fu, I have to thank you
for saving our family.

01:31:34.541 --> 01:31:36.416
How can I reward you?

01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:38.958
You are welcome. I only have one request.

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.958
I know, you love Chou-heung, right?

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:43.666
I will marry her off to you.

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:45.125
Bravo!

01:31:46.791 --> 01:31:49.750
DOUBLE HAPPINESS

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.791
Why are there so many brides?

01:31:55.958 --> 01:31:58.833
Tong Pak-fu, although I promised
to marry Chou-heung off to you,

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:01.500
there is one condition.

01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:05.833
Pick Chou-heung among the brides.

01:32:06.416 --> 01:32:07.500
Wah Man.

01:32:09.041 --> 01:32:12.625
"You should find her
before the incense burns out.

01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.166
There are several rules.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:18.916
First, stand behind the yellow line.

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:23.250
Second, the brides

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.166
can't make any noise.

01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:30.125
Third, don't use anything
to touch the brides."

01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:31.541
That's all.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.500
If you can't find Chou-heung
within the limited time,

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:35.500
you'll lose.

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:38.625
Then, Chou-heung will marry my sons.

01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:40.708
Brother, we are on the waiting list.

01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:42.125
Don't blame us.

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:46.750
Madam, please don't fool me.

01:32:47.666 --> 01:32:50.041
Mr. Tong, what do you mean?

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:52.208
In such conditions,

01:32:52.416 --> 01:32:54.458
how will I be able to find Chou-heung?

01:32:54.916 --> 01:32:56.458
I can speak from my heart

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:58.916
that I love Chou-heung wholeheartedly.

01:32:59.208 --> 01:33:01.416
Why do you have to trick me?

01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:05.500
Tong Pak-fu, you said you were poor.

01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:08.166
You were willing to sell yourself
to be our servant.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.291
There was a contract too.

01:33:11.416 --> 01:33:13.750
But in fact, you came here
to court Chou-heung.

01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:17.875
It's you who fooled us first.

01:33:18.041 --> 01:33:21.791
No! Read the first line of the contract
horizontally, please.

01:33:24.083 --> 01:33:25.416
"I came for Chou-heung."

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.291
Yes, I came for Chou-heung.

01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:28.750
I've told you why I was here.

01:33:28.833 --> 01:33:30.458
But you were not wise enough to read it.

01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:33.875
Don't be that cocky.
I want to fool you, so what?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Fool me? Why don't you go
and study for two more years?

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:38.458
I'll take her away. What can you do?
No one can stop me.

01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:40.750
Go ahead and try.
This is the Wah's residence!

01:33:40.833 --> 01:33:42.875
I'll ask His Excellency
to sue you in front of the emperor.

01:33:42.958 --> 01:33:44.458
You will be sentenced to death!

01:33:44.541 --> 01:33:46.375
Damn you, how dare you!
You are so shameless!

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:47.583
How dare you scold me?

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:48.916
Go to hell!

01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:51.250
Take it back.

01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:53.208
I won't forgive you.

01:33:54.333 --> 01:33:55.500
Come on.

01:33:55.583 --> 01:33:56.750
You bitch! Don't pull me.

01:33:56.916 --> 01:33:57.875
Mother.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.125
Stop or I will kick you to death.

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:02.750
Stop!

01:34:03.916 --> 01:34:07.291
Tong Pak-fu, Chou-heung is our maid.

01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:09.125
If you want to marry her,

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:11.791
you should follow our rules.

01:34:11.958 --> 01:34:13.833
The incense is going to be burnt out.

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:16.500
Think of something.

01:34:17.541 --> 01:34:20.375
Fine, I will try my best.

01:34:20.541 --> 01:34:22.375
I will find Chou-heung.

01:34:24.541 --> 01:34:26.208
Wonder World.

01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:47.791
Great Waves.

01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:04.833
First stance! Wonder Palm.

01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:12.458
Not this one.

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:13.958
Once again!

01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:16.416
Substitution.

01:35:26.666 --> 01:35:27.875
In double!

01:35:31.333 --> 01:35:32.208
Damn!

01:35:39.541 --> 01:35:41.208
Tong Pak-fu, are you dying?

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:42.666
Wonder Palm?

01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:44.416
Not exactly.

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:52.041
It's you who is making me
use my last stance!

01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:06.166
Turtle Ball...

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.875
It's strong.

01:36:08.041 --> 01:36:09.125
Air...

01:36:09.208 --> 01:36:11.416
He is so powerful!

01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:13.458
Is he Superman?

01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:14.875
Stance!

01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:31.208
What the heck?

01:36:33.541 --> 01:36:34.916
Look, Tong Pak-fu.

01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:38.583
I have something
to fight against your stance!

01:36:38.791 --> 01:36:40.416
Damn you, how dare you trick me?

01:36:40.625 --> 01:36:42.916
I love it, so what?

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:45.833
Damn you, go to hell!

01:36:45.958 --> 01:36:47.750
No.

01:36:47.833 --> 01:36:49.208
The incense is going to be burnt out.

01:36:49.291 --> 01:36:50.958
Chou-heung will marry my sons.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.125
Am I destined to be alone?

01:36:57.958 --> 01:37:02.500
My goodness.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.875
"The people thought I was insane.

01:37:08.208 --> 01:37:10.375
But they don't really understand me.

01:37:10.916 --> 01:37:13.041
Can't you see the graves of the heroes?

01:37:13.916 --> 01:37:16.833
No flowers, no wine, but who cares?"

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:23.000
I know!

01:37:37.375 --> 01:37:38.541
Time's up.

01:37:38.625 --> 01:37:39.791
Right on time.

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:42.125
Chou-heung.

01:37:52.916 --> 01:37:56.416
My goodness, why did you tremble
when I recited my poem?

01:37:56.833 --> 01:38:00.250
I didn't! I just wanted to go
and take a leak.

01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:03.916
Do you have a knife?

01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:05.125
What for?

01:38:05.291 --> 01:38:06.333
I want to commit suicide.

01:38:06.458 --> 01:38:09.916
No, you have to marry me first.

01:38:13.041 --> 01:38:16.458
I prefer dying.

01:38:19.416 --> 01:38:23.083
Buddy, how dare you court my girl?

01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:24.833
Your girl is over there!

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.333
Chou-heung.

01:38:35.583 --> 01:38:37.583
Hurry and have the wedding now.

01:38:46.041 --> 01:38:49.625
Tidy up first. That's better.

01:38:49.708 --> 01:38:51.208
Kneel.

01:38:51.333 --> 01:38:53.583
The wedding starts now.

01:38:55.875 --> 01:38:59.625
Chou-heung, after so many tests,

01:38:59.916 --> 01:39:01.875
I believe that
he loves you wholeheartedly.

01:39:02.166 --> 01:39:04.208
Now, I will let him marry you.

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:05.916
Thank you, Madam.

01:39:07.666 --> 01:39:09.666
Tong Pak-fu, are you satisfied?

01:39:09.916 --> 01:39:11.708
What else do you want to say?

01:39:12.416 --> 01:39:15.875
What an interesting life!

01:39:16.166 --> 01:39:17.500
I want to go and take a leak.

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:20.916
You're looking forward to
the first night with her, right?

01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:25.708
Tong Pak-fu, don't let us down.

01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:28.291
Treat Chou-heung well.

01:39:28.666 --> 01:39:30.791
Madam, I am sorry.
I have misunderstood you.

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:33.166
You will always be our brother.

01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.875
We wish you a long, happy life.

01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:36.750
Just like today!

01:39:37.791 --> 01:39:38.875
Thank you.

01:39:51.833 --> 01:39:56.958
Chou-heung, after so many difficulties...

01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:00.583
We are married at last.

01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:06.333
Congratulations. You're really great!

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.333
Your wife is so pretty.

01:40:08.416 --> 01:40:11.166
Why don't you kiss your bride now?

01:40:11.666 --> 01:40:13.333
Come on.

01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:14.583
Hold it!

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.250
Play a guessing game with me.

01:40:16.791 --> 01:40:18.000
You don't know how to play?

01:40:18.083 --> 01:40:20.333
How about mahjong,
Heaven and Nine, or Blackjack?

01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:22.000
You should know at least
one of these, right?

01:40:24.375 --> 01:40:28.208
THE END
