(Misi:15 Keluarga Baru)

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.360
Berjaya gigit?!

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.150
Meletuplah kau!

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.230
Apakah...?!

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780
Bomnya dalam sungai?
Menterinya..?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.530
Maaflah.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.560
Duduk sini dahulu, 
nanti saya lepaskan.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.920
Mustahil orang tua itu...
Tidak!

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.590
Siapakah dia?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.710
Kenapa orang lain?
Rancangannya gagal?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.590
Tak guna!

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.570
Ianya dah tamat.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.570
Awak tak akan lari 
dengan kereta itu juga.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.410
Rancangan awak sudah pun gagal.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.610
Anya-San!

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.610
Anya-San!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.880
Adakah dia kembali ke
kedai haiwan yang tadi?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.400
Cukup mustahil tapi bahaya jika
dia jumpa pengganasnya lagi.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.870
Perlu cepat cari dia!

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.070
Itu...!

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.000
Jangan harap terlepas selepas
apa yang awak buat pada Anya-San!

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.250
Huh?! Ada orang terjun?!

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.500
Ke tepilah!

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.830
Hello, ini encik polis?

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.650
Saya menemui pengganas yang alami kemalangan 
kereta di lorong belakang Taman Bandar.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.080
Sila tahannya dengan segera.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.530
Tidak. Saya sekadar suri rumah
yang melaporkannya tadi.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.050
Terima kasih.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.010
Anya-San!

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.490
Anya-San!

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.210
Apapun,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.120
 ianya cukup menyusahkan.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.970
Habis cedera sana-sini.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.250
Syukur saja ia tamat
tanpa sebarang kekecohan.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.180
Mari biarkan kerajaan di sini
menyelesaikan selebihnya.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.810
Kita pulangkan anjing ini pada mereka?

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.720
Rasanya tak perlu.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.880
Mari simpannya di sini
sehingga arahan selanjutnya.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.320
Masih banyak persoalan tentang mereka.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.680
Baiklah, sampai di sini saja.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.790
Saya perlu kembali ke
keluarga saya secepat mungkin.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.200
Hati-hati.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.080
Oh...

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.130
Apa yang awak dua buat di sini?

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.840
Bukankah pergi ke Hari Adopsi?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.830
Saya balik ke sini kerana
risau papa lama di tandas.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.100
Saya kejar dia kerana risaukan awak.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.620
Jadi... anjing itu?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.510
Itu yang berlaku.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.230
Tak sangka pergi mencari haiwan belaannya.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.080
Tak sangka mereka terlibat
dalam kejadian tersebut.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.740
Salah saya bertapa dalam jamban.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.410
Pasti awak sakit perut sebab
masakan saya waktu sarapan tadi!

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.610
Saya pun minta maaf.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.870
Sheesh, Awak sekali...!

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.460
Papa dah cakap jangan
merayau sendirian, kan!

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.250
Maafkan saya!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.010
Are you okay?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.010
This doggy saved me.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.520
So that means this dog is
also a product of Project Apple...

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.650
If that's the case,
we can't just set it free.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040
Thank you for saving my daughter.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.750
Excuse me.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.330
We're from the Security Service.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.500
We'd like to ask a few questions
regarding the incident in the Central Area.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.920
Do you have a minute?

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.050
I see.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.160
Then it seems safe to assume that
the dog was also trained by the terrorists.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.790
We'll take care of it.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.590
Please do.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.940
Incidentally,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.180
in view of the situation in the East
and West, this case will not be made public,

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.170
so be sure to keep this to yourselves.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.820
We thank you for your cooperation.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.550
Now that things have settled down,
let's go back to looking for a pet dog.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.690
Sure. All right, Anya...

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.330
No!

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.580
Anya wants this doggy!

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.460
What are you...

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.360
Anya wants to keep this doggy!

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.120
No, you can't.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.410
That dog belonged to the bad gu...

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.960
He saved Anya, so no!

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.090
You said yourself
that you wanted a small dog, right?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.010
Anya wants this doggy!
Anya loves this big doggy!

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.100
Stop being selfish!

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.100
If we can't keep this doggy, Anya will leave
the house and stop coming to school!

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.600
Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.240
Why bring school into this?!

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.850
- It's okay, Anya...

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.400
- Sheesh... Anya...
- It's okay, Anya...

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.160
All right, fine.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.020
Hand... Ma'am?!

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.530
A-Are you sure?

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.730
Well, it won't matter
if one dog goes missing.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.850
All the terrorists have been arrested,
and the dogs themselves are harmless.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.810
Hey!

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.710
If she keeps sulking,
it'll jeopardize Operation Strix.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.660
Gotta bite the bullet.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.050
Well, yeah, but...

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.270
Put the dog under your observation
and keep it under tight control.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.930
We have other dogs for our
investigations, so no problem.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.170
You're trying to add
more work to my pile...?

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.680
There were a lot of doggies,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.580
but will they be hurt by the police?

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.710
Don't worry, miss.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.070
We will treat the dogs politely.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.070
We will also prepare warm beds
and good food for them.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.340
These dogs have probably been
through hard times.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.190
So please treat him with kindness.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.090
Be sure to look after him.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.660
Promise me, okay?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.340
Thank you...

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.920
Madam in suit...

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.490
She's a nice girl, huh?

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.350
You don't know what I've been through...

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.050
Yes, I do.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.230
I once had a daughter of her age.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.780
Good for you Anya, Doggy!

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.680
Glad to see it's so peaceful today.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.010
Right...

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.450
For now, we'll take the dog with us
to check for any diseases.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.220
If there's no problem, we'll deliver it
to your house by tomorrow.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.500
All right.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.320
Let's go home now, shall we?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.520
Sure. It feels like a long day,
I'm so tired.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.850
It's a field trip all the way back home.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.310
We can't let our guard down.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.020
Did they teach you that at school?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.590
It's not a field trip.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.360
Don't worry, Anya.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.110
The case is solved now.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.740
Hehehe... I've defeated the bad guys...

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.500
...and kept the peace
of my country, unobserved!

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.340
It's thanks to me that
Father could stop the bomb!

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.140
I've saved the world!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.960
Huh... We barely averted tension
between East and West...

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.020
But I'm beat... My stomach aches...

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.370
Hehehe...

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.530
Ehe~

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.300
Huh...

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.340
Next on today's news.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.280
- Yesterday, two traffic accidents happened...
- Where's the doggy?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.740
- ...in the city.
- Where's the doggy?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.910
Where's the doggy?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.240
Calm down. They'll be here soon.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.750
Just sit down and watch the TV.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.570
Good evening.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.500
Doggy!

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.670
We'll leave him in your care, then.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.260
He must be wondering where he is.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.020
Welcome to Anya's house, Doggy!

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.640
This is your house too from today!

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.690
Except that we need
a proper name to call him.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.620
Name...

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.900
Number Eight.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.650
Come out.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.800
Time for your meds.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.280
Hey, stay still!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.410
Here's your snack.
Be grateful and eat it.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.690
Increase the voltage.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.950
But it's already...

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.290
Do it. We can always replace a dead dog.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.110
What happened?

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.180
Is he nervous? Want a snack?

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.770
Make yourself at home!
You're a Forger now!

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.930
Negotiations on disarmament
have started well...

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.250
...into their second day of the meeting,
which began last night, and...

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.130
Anya has helped defeat
the bad guys, but no stars?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.930
No. We have to keep this a secret...

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.700
...so that the East and the West
don't fight each other.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.750
Don't talk about it at school too, okay?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.140
You'll be caught by the police,
and won't be able to go home anymore.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.080
Even though we've saved
the world together...

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.540
Come on, you'll be late, Anya.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.390
If I can't get a star from this, then...

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.360
There's only the Friendship Scheme!

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.740
I'll go to the second son's house
and make Father's mission a success!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.210
What?! You have a dog?!

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.830
We should compare its size with my dog's!
Come to my house!

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.590
Hehehe... I'll save the world
as many times as needed!

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.760
Morning, Anya.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.420
Mornrning.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.290
Oh, thank goodness
her Starlight Anya boom has subsided.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.790
Look, Becky.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:11.480
Hm?

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.360
A dog has appeared in Anya's house too.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.780
Really?! What does it look like?!
What breed?!

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.000
The white one.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.110
How old is it?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.240
Dunno. He's big.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.690
I wonder which one is cuter,
my Wiesel or your dog?

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.490
It'll be nice if they can play together.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.750
She responded!

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.870
Hey, maybe I should come visit your...

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.220
Hey!

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.630
What do you want?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.390
Anya has a dog now.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.770
So what?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.030
The world... is over now...

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.980
Kicking a commoner to the curb...

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.930
Way to go, Master Damian!

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.270
Huh? Was that really evil of me?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.120
I didn't knew you were capable of that!

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.930
It must be a dirty mongrel anyway, right?

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.260
What's... the name?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.260
Huh?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.550
Name...

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.890
Right. I'm asking you for once.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.690
Dog...

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.730
You're not qualified to own a dog.
I regret asking that.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.580
Huh? How to decide the name?

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.330
Hmm... I guess you can use cute
foods or flowers as reference?

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.310
Foods... Peanuts?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.710
He's a big dog, isn't he?
Wouldn't naming him Peanuts feel weird?

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.410
It's important to get the
right impression from the looks.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.380
Looks...

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:06.990
White hair...

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.110
Uhh...

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.090
You should let your papa
or mama decide that for you...

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.860
Does Anya have no taste...?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.320
Father! Mother! Anya's back!

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.970
Welcome back!

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.850
Getting along already, aren't you two?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.330
Help me! He's going to eat me!

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.810
Let's take him for a walk, shall we?

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.830
A walk!

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.990
There's a dog park near the library!

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.470
Woof, woof, woof!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.050
Father, Anya wants to pull the rope too!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:56.100
It's still too early for you.
He'll drag you with him.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.510
Even though he's trained,
we still need to discipline him.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.260
You have a lot to learn too, okay?

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.580
How to feed him, praise him,
scold him, et cetera.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.880
You need to be determined
to take care of him to the bitter end.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.860
Okay.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.030
Anyway, have you decided
on a name for him?

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.030
Anya's naming taste is hopeless...

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.620
Huh? Oh...

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.930
You should pick a simple name that is easy
to call and easy for the dog to recognize.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.370
Apparently, dogs are not
good at understanding plosives,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.810
so it's a good idea to use a vowel structure
that makes it easier for them

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.940
to distinguish between them.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.870
Especially A, U, O.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.510
This is difficult...

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.640
Understanding... plosives?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.850
You want me to explode you?

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.210
Or maybe crush you to death?

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.110
You're so bad at understanding
my words, aren't you?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.250
Well, you can decide
after seeing what he's like.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.580
Dog Park!

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.840
You jump around too, Doggy!

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.610
Or else it'll be Anya Park!

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.640
Here we go, Leo!

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.710
Fetch!

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.260
All right! Let's do that!

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280
Fetch!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.430
I really can't do this
without naming you first?

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.170
Excuse me.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.670
Hm?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.920
What is this doggy's name?

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.050
What made you decide that?
Tell me the secret!

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.800
Don't go too far away, okay!

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.940
Your name will be
Lucky Vanilla Princess the Third!

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.360
Then General Atomic Angel Charlie!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.580
Looks like she's having fun there.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.890
"You need to be determined
to take care of him to the bitter end"...

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.580
That's not something I could say to myself.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.630
When the mission is over,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.070
the Forger family
will be relieved of its duties.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.470
And their roles will end as well.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.090
Of course, I mean to do
a massive cover-up after that, too...

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.620
But the terrorist attack
reminded me of this.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.110
That this peace between
East and West is only a facade.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.620
I shall aim to end the Cold War
as soon as possible...

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.740
...which is the best possible future.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.580
Hey, we're going home.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.310
It's studying time once we're home.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.400
Shock!

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:00.990
Huh? Huh? What? Eh?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.200
Where are Anya's gloves?!

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.250
Maybe you dropped them somewhere?

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.560
Those are Anya's favorites!

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.640
They're not here...

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.530
Ah, Anya's gloves!

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.980
Give them back!

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.270
It's mine now! Finders keepers!

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.310
Hey! What are you doing to my dog?!

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.950
What kind of stray dog are you?!

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.390
It's okay, mommy's here.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.390
Thank you, Doggy!

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.210
Here is your bellyband
stolen by the League of Evil.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.880
I have come to give it
back to you, Princess Honey.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.230
Oh, thank you, Bondman!

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:12.020
It was a precious gift
from my late mother!

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.460
You're just like a Bondman!
You got these back!

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.240
You're also wearing gloves, right?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.660
What's up?

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:27.360
Father!
Anya's decided on the doggy's name!

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.540
Hm?

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.800
His name will be Bond!

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.710
From Bondman, huh?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.040
Well, it's a good name.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.840
That tickles!

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.890
Looks like he likes it.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.560
The collar matches him too!

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.060
All right, Bond.
Here is your first mission.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.970
You must eat this dog food.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.760
Don't give him too much, okay?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.080
It's neither good nor bad...

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.040
Oh, so you want to pee?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.170
Follow me, Bond.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.090
Look. Here's your toilet.

00:21:20.758 --> 00:21:24.818
If you do it somewhere else, Mother,
who loves cleanliness, might snap.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.460
Be mindful not to get killed
and let it out here.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.480
It was a poop. Stinks.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.190
All right, Bond! Now we watch cartoon!

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.370
I'll show you your roots!

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.400
Hey, I told you it's studying time
when we get home, right?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.650
Prepare your book
while I'm taking a shower, okay?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.880
Those guys...

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.110
Loid, Loid!

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.120
Take a look!

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.770
What is it?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.250
They got tired from playing
and fell asleep.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.780
Wow! Is she an angel, by any chance?

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.830
I guess we'll let her off the hook today.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.570
Let's do that.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.900
Never ever take your eyes off the details

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.860
'Cause these adults are busy pretending

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.930
To become something they really are not

if it doesn't have a story it can tell

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.840
Our lives are just made-up
spinning in the marionette

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.600
In fact, everyday we spend is a miracle,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.690
reaching out to each other
as a matter of course

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.080
Hm, that's being warm-hearted

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.570
Is there anything lonelier
than laughing a matter away?

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.020
Even depressing nights can be colorful

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.640
And variable

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.960
There's no life which is a bad life

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.090
If you know how to pretend to be strong

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.420
But what you've been through, and the
fact that you were born cannot be erased

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.880
Your soft heart can be hurt by a badinage

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.230
But it's okay to stay being soft,
you can stay as you are

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.270
Never ever take your eyes off day-to-day

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.190
