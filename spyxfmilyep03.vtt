<i>All people have a side of
themselves they can't reveal to others.</i>

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.280
<i>To friends, to lovers, or even family.</i>

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.760
<i>They hide with their fake smiles
and bluffs their real intentions...</i>

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680
<i>...and their true colours.</i>

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.970
<i>That is how the world...</i>

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.180
<i>...is mending a temporary peace.</i>

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.870
<i>In an era in which the nations...</i>

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.920
<i>...of the world were
waging a fierce war...</i>

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.430
<i>...were two countries
at each other's throats.</i>

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.430
<i>Ostania in the East,
trying to wage a war,</i>

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.180
<i>and Westalis in the West,
trying to stop it.</i>

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.350
<i>To find out what a certain key person
of the Ostanian government was up to,</i>

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.810
<i>Westalis commenced Operation Strix.</i>

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.970
<i>They left the execution
to their top agent, Twilight.</i>

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.240
<i>And the mission given to him,
who could use a hundred different faces...</i>

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.240
<i>...was to make a family.</i>

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.990
<i>In this world like nuts packed in a bag,</i>

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.810
<i>Everyone is snuggling up to
someone they meet</i>

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.940
<i>We are mixed in there and smiling</i>

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.610
<i>By pretending we are all nuts like peanuts</i>

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.530
<i>On the template of happiness,</i>

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.080
<i>Behind the surface
which is literally picturesque</i>

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.290
<i>We can't be as we are,</i>

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.630
<i>Even when we put our hands
together sitting around a table</i>

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.720
<i>Home with full of secrets
and patches, you know?</i>

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.760
<i>Even though I chew up the real emotions,</i>

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.930
<i>They still don't disappear</i>

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.520
<i>They are still stuck in my teeth</i>

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.520
<i>My life is so insecure and drifting,</i>

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.730
<i>And I know</i>

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.150
<i>Every day is so mediocre,</i>

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.950
<i>but I'm here and so are you</i>

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.330
<i>Just by this truth,
my stomach feels heavy</i>

(Ostania, Berlint Park Ave. 128)

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.750
Is that all...

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.230
...for your stuff?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.640
Yes.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.480
That's an awful few.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.720
Um, Loid... What about the bedroom?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.580
Of course, we have one for each.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.320
We'll just make it look like we're
sleeping together when there's a guest.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.770
O-Okay.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.160
Welcome to Anya's home!

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.740
I'll be in your care, Anya.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.140
<i>In this place was a rather unusual family.</i>

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.470
<i>The father, Loid Forger.
A psychiatrist.</i>

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.690
<i>Identity: a spy.
Codename: Twilight.</i>

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.280
<i>The mother, Yor Forger.
A public servant.</i>

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.620
<i>Identity: an assassin.
Codename: Thorn Princess.</i>

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.760
<i>The daughter, Anya Forger.
Identity: an Esper.</i>

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.500
Anya's so happy to finally have a mother!

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.500
Mother...

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.880
Helping out~

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.770
Oh, yeah. By the way...

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.680
Through the connections of a judge I knew,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.040
I was able to change the date of our
marriage certificate to a year ago.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.700
<i>It's forged, actually.</i>

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:15.488
As for the reason why
we'd been living separately,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.630
and the excuses of all kinds
to tell your brother,

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.980
we can just think
about them later.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.160
Okay.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.990
<i>If I arranged for the registration
to be just before the exam,</i>

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.410
<i>the school would be suspicious of us.</i>

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.320
<i>"Shopkeeper" has also given me permission,
so I can relax for now.</i>

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.640
<i>So exciting...</i>

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.150
<i>The father, the mother, and the daughter.</i>

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.440
<i>For each of their own interests,
these three individuals...</i>

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.430
<i>...decided to live together
as a pretend family...</i>

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.430
(Mission: 3 - Prepare for the Entrance Exam)
<i>...while hiding their identities.</i>

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.650
Anya will show Mother around!

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.810
We'll be having a mock
interview when you're done.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.170
This is the kitchen!

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.130
Father's so good at cooking!

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.320
Is that so?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.620
This is the toilet.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.730
That's the bath!

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.070
So sparkling!

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.860
Anya can wash face alone.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.330
Good girl, Anya!

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.840
This is Anya's room!

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.850
Welcome!

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.330
Heheh... Excuse me.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.920
Wow, what a cute room!

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.770
I'll introduce you to Chimera~

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.270
I'm Chimera.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.600
Pleasure t' meetcha.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.130
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chimera.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.110
I'm Anya's mother.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.970
Father's room!

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.620
So this is Loid's room...

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.440
This is Mother's room.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:51.990
Come on in, Mother.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.460
Excuse me, then...

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.630
So this is my room...

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.540
It's a wonderful room!

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.720
Glad to hear that.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.960
This should be everything.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.440
What do you think of
the furniture's placement?

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.730
I've also done a bit of cleaning earlier.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.810
It's good.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.960
Anya also helped with the cleaning!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.440
Oh, really? Thank you!

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.610
Hehe... Is Anya a good girl, Father?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.870
All you did was flip
the bucket full of water.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.960
Gah!

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.610
I don't think I deserve to
be lent such a wonderful room...

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.890
What are you saying?
Just think of it as your own home...

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.970
Or rather, this <i>is</i> your home,
so feel free to use it any way you like.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.560
Okay!

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.930
I'll fetch the unused
cardboard boxes later.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.430
I'm done with the unboxing, Loid!

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.310
That's so quick of you.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.700
So he's the brother
you've been talking about?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.200
Ah, yes.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.980
He's a fellow public servant as you, right?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.390
Yes. He's been looking so busy these days...

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.620
So we could only talk through phone.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.710
You two really look alike.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.890
I should say hello to him
after Anya's interview...

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.080
Um, about that, Loid...

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.940
I don't have the suitable outfit
to wear for the interview...

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.120
Well, we can just go to the tailor today.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.510
Thank you!

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.000
Helping out, helping out~

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.700
Oh, let me unbox it myself, Anya!

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.650
<i>That box contains my "tools" for work and
poison that can bring down an elephant...</i>

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.940
What will you have?

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.360
I'll have black coffee, please.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.480
Anya wants cocoa!

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.350
With sugar and milk, that is.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.470
That's the one!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.580
Wow! You made the cookies yourself?

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.440
It's actually my first time making some.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.790
I did it by the book,
so the cookies should turn out well.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.710
I hope they suit your taste.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.810
I'll have one, then.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.120
It's so tasty!
You really are good at cooking!

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.320
Oh, you flatter me.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.440
Anya also helped out with the cookies!

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.690
You did?

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.760
All you did was get yourself
covered in flour,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.040
and keep snatching the
peanuts for the cookies, right?

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.240
Huh!

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.690
Let's begin the mock interview after a cup.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.200
Eden Academy is a top-class
elite school in the country.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.860
The child as well as the parents
are screened in the interview.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.930
Your family's overall quality and
education will be tested.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:50.990
Are we clear?

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.890
Here comes the first question, then.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.260
Could you please tell me
your name and address?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.730
Anya F-F-F-Fo-Forger...

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.770
Add ress?

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.940
It means this place.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.350
Anya's home!

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.060
Not that.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.070
Uh, what do you do
on the weekends, Miss Anya?

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.270
Father always tells me to stay home,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.800
so I watch TV all by myself!

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.070
Hold on...

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.340
That's a bad impression. Ma'am.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.400
Yes!

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.250
Could you please tell me the reasons
you're dead set on Eden Academy?

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.290
The reasons? Dead set?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.440
Dead... Dead...

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.340
The reasons include cardiopulmonary
arrest, excessive bleeding...

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.930
Complex fracture of the whole body,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.170
and also cranial depression...

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.600
Let me change the question.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.930
What is your education policy?

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.710
Huh? Um...

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.900
Aim for the first strike?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.610
<i>I can't believe she could
raise her brother properly with this.</i>

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.670
<i>I've been a spy for many years now.</i>

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.940
<i>And I, having completed
various kinds of missions...</i>

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.860
<i>...am almost at my wits'
end for the first time.</i>

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.690
This isn't working.
We can't pass the interview like this.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.560
Maybe we should give up.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.400
Please think of your late wife's will, Loid!

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.530
<i>Looks like it's still too early
for a mock interview.</i>

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.600
All right, let's go for a walk.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.720
We need to broaden our horizons, learn
the common sense in an upper-class family,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.750
and create a common understanding
between the three of us.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.510
A wok, a wok!
Lalalala~

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.100
It's a walk.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.250
Mother, want to hold hands?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.410
O-Okay, then.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.100
<i>Thank goodness they could get along well.</i>

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.250
<i>I've already had a plan in mind.</i>

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.940
<i>By the end of the day,
people should only see us as a normal,</i>

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.360
<i>or rather, a good,
perfectly fine, family.</i>

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.180
<i>She reminds me of my brother
when he was still small and cute...</i>

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.830
<i>I remember I used to
break two of his ribs...</i>

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.960
<i>...when I tried hugging
my brother a long time ago.</i>

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.580
<i>Heheh... I need to be careful...</i>

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.960
<i>Huh?</i>

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.980
<i>What?</i>

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.570
<i>Did I speak too soon?</i>

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.510
B-By the way, where are we going?

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.050
I've got various of tickets from my work.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.650
<i>Eden Academy is steeped
in tradition and prestige.</i>

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.760
<i>We must become more
cultured in first-class stuff...</i>

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.020
<i>...to keep up our appearances at any moment.</i>

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.880
<i>All right! Onto the next one!</i>

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
Anya.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.360
Keep your voice down here, okay?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:37.980
Yep.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.720
<i>After being exposed to first-class music,</i>

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.250
<i>we must also become more cultured
in first-class art to (REDACTED).</i>

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.220
Father! She's butt naked!

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.400
Head chopped, body chopped.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.580
I told you to keep
your voice down here...

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.520
Yor...?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.600
Yo—

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.620
Anya wants to do that!

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.290
A drawing corner, huh? Go ahead.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.240
Why don't we take a rest, Yor?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.210
Sure.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.660
Anya's home is a big castle~

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.090
The boss of the secret
organization is Director Chimera~

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.400
Father's a spy~
Pew, pew~

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.270
Mother's an assassin~
Slash, slash, whoosh~

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.930
Shall we go now?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.290
Okay.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.730
It's done!

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.650
Time to go, Anya.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.110
<i>They'll find out about
my power if they see this!</i>

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.410
Hm? Oh, that's a big drawing.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.080
There's a pig in the middle of the forest.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.810
It's Chimera living in a castle!

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.500
Oh, okay.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.500
But that Bondman is obvious.
Am I right?

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.580
Y-Yep...

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.580
It's the spy show from last week, right?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.180
So this witch-looking woman is the princess?

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.640
That's kind of gruesome.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.950
That's a cute cat, though.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.990
It's a dog!

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.180
Oh, my bad.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.650
We're going to the tailor next.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.150
I'm sorry for taking your day-off...

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.360
We all need this, so don't worry.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.860
Anya's formal wear is so cute!

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.390
It fits Anya well!

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.970
This shop is the best!
It's Anya's favourite!

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.110
Thank you.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.100
I'm going for a wok with
this dress for the first time...

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.320
Today's a day of celebration, then.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.960
Celebration of the wok!

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.780
Then, why don't we
drop by the photo studio later?

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.880
Please come here, Yor.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.760
Okay.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.800
I think this colour works best
for a semi-formal wear.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.930
What do you think?

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.260
I prefer my dress in black or red.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.090
Really?

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.760
I think this'll suit you well, though...

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.130
Then, what about this?

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.310
<i>Judging from her luggage when we moved in,</i>

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.680
<i>I thought she couldn't
care less about her outfit...</i>

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.980
So you have a preference
for your outfit's overall colour?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.400
Ah, it's not like that...

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.080
<i>It looks so pretty,</i>

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.110
<i>but if I were to wear it for my job,
the splattered blood would stand out...</i>

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.050
Looks like Yor found a good man.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.920
I hope they last long.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.130
Though If I were her,
I wouldn't marry a single father.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.900
Looks like we can have more
outfits done before the interview.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.930
I'm sorry for having you order so many...

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.150
You look good in anything
other than black and red.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.540
And we'll be going for
more walks from now, too.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.200
A wok, a wok!

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.860
That tailor is your go-to shop, right?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.440
We'll be visiting them again next time,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.110
so we must tell the owner
about our marriage by then, right?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.560
You're right!

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.940
The Nationalist Party
shall take a course of peace...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.410
...in negotiating with the West.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.100
<i>- Eden Academy has also been active</i>

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.130
- You idiot!
<i>- Eden Academy has also been active</i>

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.390
- You idiot!
<i>- in patriotic education.</i>

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.590
- We should just kill all the Westerns!
<i>- We must also be cultured</i>

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.300
- We should just kill all the Westerns!
<i>- in politics and history...</i>

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.290
<i>Get out of here, you traitor!</i>

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.120
<i>My family was killed by the West!</i>

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.590
<i>Enough with the lip-service...</i>

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.270
What's wrong?

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.700
Anya hates this kind of place...

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.710
Sorry. Is it a bit scary for you?

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.360
Why don't we rest somewhere?

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.780
Father, I'm hungry.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.400
Huh?

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.840
Weren't you feeling sick earlier?

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.790
Hey, Anya. Don't just eat the peanuts.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.280
Also, don't use your bare hand to eat.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.220
Yor, you're... Uh...

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.630
<i>I've been a spy for many years now.</i>

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.660
<i>And I, having completed
various kinds of missions...</i>

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.780
<i>...am almost at my wits' end once again.</i>

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.580
Don't worry about it, Father.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.400
About what?!

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.650
<i>I knew I'd picked the wrong people for this.</i>

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.940
<i>No, I shouldn't have relied
on someone else in the first place.</i>

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.900
<i>I shouldn't have left the
success or failure of the mission...</i>

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.540
<i>...to the value judgments of others,
especially amateurs.</i>

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.900
<i>It's an ironclad rule of espionage
to anticipate and prepare...</i>

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.340
<i>...for every eventuality and to
act on the basis of careful planning.</i>

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.350
<i>Which means listing every
single possible question,</i>

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.920
<i>and having them both memorize...</i>

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.730
<i>...the perfect answer to each one.</i>

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.560
Or I could just...

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.420
Um...

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.930
Loid.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.940
Why don't we go outside
for a change of pace?

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.590
People are like trash.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.900
Where did you learn that?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.140
Animations.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.030
Huh...

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.330
I didn't know there was
a park on the outskirts of the town.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.030
I only come here every once in a while.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.540
Whenever I get tired after work,
I find myself here...

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:01.560
And when I think that what I'm
doing benefits everyone living here...

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.520
It fuels me to do my best again...

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.380
Ah, I'm sorry! It must be boring here!

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.550
Anya loves this place
more than a crowded one!

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.370
That's great, then!

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.900
Help! A pickpocket!

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.580
What a careless old lady...

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.450
Not on my watch!

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.300
Hold it right there!

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.450
Ugh, looks like I have no choice.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.950
<i>I lost him already...</i>

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.710
Are you hurt, Ma'am?

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.140
Don't worry, it's just a scratch.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.070
I'll make sure to catch him,
and take you to a hospital later!

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.280
Oh, thank you.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.720
Oh, I left those two behind...

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.730
<i>He's blended in with the crowd...</i>

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.730
<i>I feel bad for Yor,
but there's no way I can find him like this.</i>

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.730
<i>Sheesh, I'm famished!</i>

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.290
<i>So expensive...</i>

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.470
<i>- Wow, so cute!</i>

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.210
<i>- Oh, shoot! I'm leaking!</i>
<i>- Wow, it's so cute!</i>

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.050
<i>- Oh, shoot! I'm leaking!</i>
<i>- My legs hurt...</i>

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.740
<i>- My legs hurt...</i>

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.610
<i>If only a million dalc
would fall form the sky...</i>

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.140
<i>Oh, I forgot to pay rent!</i>

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.240
<i>Guess I should hit on her.</i>

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.650
Hey...
There you go again...

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.750
<i>Heh... That old hag was
really stuffing a lot, huh!</i>

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:29.810
Father!

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.230
What's up?

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.640
I want to eat a cake!

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.660
Huh?

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.460
We just ate at a restaurant, though...

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.120
Hm?

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.810
<i>That guy...</i>

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.610
<i>He may have changed his outfit,
but he can't change his walking habit.</i>

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.090
<i>- You think you can fool me with that?</i>

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.150
- Loid!
<i>- You think you can fool me with that?</i>

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.240
Mother's here!

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.860
Yor, take care of Anya!

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.650
<i>I can lie low for a while with this.</i>

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.160
<i>Gotta grab me a nice meal first...</i>

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.080
All you'll be getting...

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.180
...is a foul meal.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.320
<i>A spy...</i>

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.770
<i>Can't stand out...</i>

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.260
Uhh...This guy's a pickpocket,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.350
so could someone please call the police?

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.100
Thank you for taking me here
and returning my wallet.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.470
I wanted to use the money
to buy my grandchild a present.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.950
Thank you for your help!

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:32.980
Ah, not at all...

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.770
The one who took it back was... my husband.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.920
No...

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.280
I wouldn't have gone after him
had it not been for Yor.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.950
Thank you, Mister!
What a good man you are!

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.120
Uhh... Like I said...

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.470
<i>You're all heroes in the shadows.</i>

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.050
<i>Your heroic actions
will never see the light of day.</i>

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.240
Thank you so much.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.060
<i>Well, I guess it won't hurt
to be thanked by someone sometimes.</i>

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.600
<i>You're really a shy one, Father.</i>

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.570
Thank you, Yor.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.760
Today was a nice change of pace.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.610
I'll be able to do my best
at work with this.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.330
Father and Mother flirting?

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.120
No way!

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.930
You don't want to thank Anya too?

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.080
Right.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.250
Thanks to your hefty stomach,
we could catch the bad guy.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.540
Good girl.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.820
What a lovely family you are, eh?

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.630
Here. Have a candy.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.950
Candy!

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.690
Don't forget to say thank you.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.610
The wok's over!

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.640
What a long day.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.650
Mother!

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.150
Anya wants to drink cocoa!

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.250
As you wish.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.210
Hey, if you're free,
let's have another mock interview.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.450
Okay, Miss Anya.
What do you do on the weekends?

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.180
I watch an opera show, go to
an art gallery, and eat at a restaurant!

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:16.840
Yes!

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.000
Exactly that!

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.500
If they ask you this,
just answer it like that.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.360
All right, onto the next question.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.370
You saw your friend doing something bad.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.350
What would you do?

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.420
I'd jump upon them, finish them,
and feed them a foul meal.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.350
Uh, I'd appreciate it
if you'd just forget that...

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.800
<i>Ugh... Maybe we should just give up.</i>

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.870
But you were so cool, Father!

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.830
You really were!

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.280
Bam!

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.120
A foul meal!

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.800
Cocoa is the best...

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.830
What a lovely family you are, eh?

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.270
<i>If people think that way of us...</i>

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.840
<i>I guess I could say we're about 1% of
the way through our preparations.</i>

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.050
<i>Fighting with each other</i>

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.390
<i>'Til almost everything was in ruins</i>

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.790
<i>On this mischievous planet</i>

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:44.300
<i>I've been an outsider
since the day I was born</i>

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.170
<i>My tears have run dry</i>

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:54.440
<i>The place I'm going back to is in my dreams</i>

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.810
<i>I met you</i>

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.500
<i>where I came spilling out</i>

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.500
<i>You with all your secrets</i>

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.950
<i>Pretending to be normal</i>

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.080
<i>I'd given up searching
for a place where I belong</i>

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:17.630
<i>Only to find out I had to
create one for myself all along</i>

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.310
<i>We made a deal that day</i>

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.290
<i>Thicker than blood</i>

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.430
<i>A pact from heart to heart</i>

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.170
<i>Shall we hold hands and head home?</i>

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.990
<i>What should we eat tonight?</i>

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.720
<i>"Here's what happened today"</i>

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.430
<i>That's what I wanted to talk to you about</i>

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.190
<i>Any and every day is</i>

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.760
<i>A comedy with you</i>

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.600
<i>Dancing on a creaking bed</i>

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.670
<i>Rolling around in laughter</i>

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:58.490
<i>We'll keep on with our
ridiculous everyday life</i>

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.070
